Google Store launches in Puerto Rico, Pixel and other products available for purchase Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/31 4:35pm PDTMay 31, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares116 Google News Puerto Rico, despite being a territory of the United States, is often treated as a separate country by businesses. Until now, the online Google Store was not available on the island, but that changes today. Google has updated the Google Store country picker to include Puerto Rico. In addition, the support document listing product availability by country has been updated with mentions of the island. Currently, only the Google Pixel, Daydream View, Samsung Chromebook Plus, and various accessories are available for purchase. Still, at least Puerto Rico residents can now buy an unlocked Pixel straight from Google. You can view the island's Google Store at the source link below.

I ordered my Nexus 4 and a Pixel C from google store. And I obviously live in Puerto Rico. Frisi Just put United States in the billing address and you're good to go. ;) Christian Camacho My account always had access to Google Devices and I live in PR. I've been ordering from the Google Store since the Nexus 4. I'm confused. Frisi This is for those who put Puerto Rico as country instead of United States. I always put my address to United States as country, since we're part of the US. If I put Puerto Rico it even locks me out of the Play Store (except for apps and games). Frisi It has always worked. Since we're part of the United States, we could put US as country and have access to Google's entire hardware catalogue. I have ordered the Pixel, Nexus 5X, Chromecast, Chromebooks, cases, etc. Same applies with Google Play itself. If you put US as country, Movies, Music, and Books works. If you put just Puerto Rico as country then you're locked out from the aforementioned services. MJ Great, now that Puerto Rico has access to the Play store next thing you know they will want to be US citizens. Frisi We *are* US citizens... MJ Shhhhh... Most people in the US don't know that. Tom Westrick They already are US citizens MJ I guess should have ended my comment with /joke.

Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said. By: Bloomberg | Published:June 1, 2017 11:08 am Apple has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Related News Google expands paid carpooling across California YouTube app for Android gets new UI, adds bottom navigation bar Google’s Nest Labs wants your home security camera to recognise you Apple Inc. is already in your pocket, on your desk and underneath your television. Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well. The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said. The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has emphasized Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s $24 billion. A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product. An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better.

New York Times Posted May 31, 2017 May 31, 2017 Updated May 31, 2017 7:17pm GOOGLETRENDS Google released this map of the most misspelled words in America. “Beautiful” and “pneumonia” hardly go together, but they ranked as the top two words that Americans most sought how to spell in the first four months of this year, according to an analysis by Google Trends. The analysis, which covered Jan. 1 through April 30, identified in each state what word was searched most often when users typed “how to spell” into the company’s search engine. Google Trends posted a map of the results on Twitter on Tuesday, one day before the start of the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Naturally, the map, labeled “America’s Most Misspelled Words,” included a misspelling. The original map listed the most-searched word in Washington, D.C., as “nintey.” That was corrected in a revised map a few hours later. The analysis produced some surprising findings. “Beautiful” led the list of most commonly searched words, with California, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York and Ohio residents checking how to spell it. “Pneumonia” came in second, stumping residents of Alabama, Maine, Michigan and Washington. The significance of the most-searched words in certain states is a mystery: “giraffe” (Louisiana); “twelve” (New Jersey) and “people” (Hawaii). And then there were the residents of Connecticut and West Virginia who wanted to check on the spelling of “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,” the word (or is it a phrase?) that was popularized in the 1964 Disney movie “Mary Poppins.” In Wisconsin, residents most frequently searched for how to spell “Wisconsin.” (In fairness to the people of the Badger State, if you stare at the name long enough, you’ll convince yourself it’s not spelled right.) Stephanie Klett, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Tourism, attributed the confusion to the numerous Indian tribes that are native to Wisconsin and their conflicting spellings of the state’s name. Other states have simpler names, she said, adding: “Much like our incredible state, there is no word out there like Wisconsin. We’re unique.” The Google list is a collection of results that are returned by one specific search by the company’s users; others who have sought to catalog misspellings have arrived at different examples in recent years. For one, the words compiled by Google were at odds with those most commonly checked on the Oxford Dictionaries website, Katherine Connor Martin, the head of U.S. Dictionaries at Oxford University Press, said in an email. “The top misspelled words are ‘accommodate’ and ‘accommodation,’ so the tricky double letters in these words (and words like ‘address’ and ‘occurrence’) seem to be tripping up the most users,” she wrote. “Accommodate” was also the most misspelled word for users of Dictionary.com in April, a spokeswoman said. The spellings of some words were more irksome than others. A 2015 online survey conducted on behalf of Dictionary.com found almost 40 percent of Americans were most bothered by the misspelling of “February.” English poses unique spelling challenges, especially to nonnative speakers who are learning the language, Julie Amberg, associate professor of English and humanities at York College of Pennsylvania, said Wednesday. For instance, the vowel sound “e” can be expressed in combinations of “ey,” “ee” and “ea,” she said. “English does not have a sound-to-letter correspondence,” she said. “We have many ways to spell the same sounds. That right there is the real problem.” What word has her constantly consulting a dictionary? “Occurrence,” which was No. 6 on the Oxford Dictionaries list.

Google's NZ tax bill remains modest 3:03 PM Thursday Jun 1, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Company Taxation Google Stephanie Davis, head of Google New Zealand. Photograph by Fiona Goodall / Getty Images. The New Zealand subsidiary of internet giant Google paid $356,124 in New Zealand income taxes last year. In formal accounts to December 31 2016, the company recorded revenues of $12.6m, up from $10.7m the year earlier. The company's structuring sees its New Zealand subsidiary earn only a "service fee" from parent company Alphabet in return for providing marketing services. New Zealand companies paying Google for advertising are typically invoiced from related companies based in low-tax Singapore or Ireland. An investigation last year into the online advertising market found Google and Facebook - who run a similar setup - likely respectively earned $400m and $100m in advertising revenues from sales to local client. In a statement accompanying the accounts a spokesman for the company said they paid US$4.7b in taxes globally. "Google complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We agree everyone would benefit from a simpler, more transparent system and believe international forums are the right places to have those conversations," the spokesman said. The tax arrangements of multinational companies - particularly internet firms whose "weightless" operations allow them to easily relocate economic activity around the globe - has become a hot topic internationally in recent years. New Zealand government reforms intended to crack down on profit-shifting by multinational companies, expected to haul in $100m annually, have explicitly warned problems of capturing tax revenue from online economic activity are unresolved.

X The bigot in the machine: Tackling big data’s inherent biases Discrimination in statistical analysis goes deeper than algorithms written by humans about an hour ago Marie Boran         In 2015, a group of US researchers with an interest in internet user privacy developed a tool to examine Google’s advertisement settings feature, which allows users to select for the type of online ads they see based on their interests. The goal was to determine what effect different browsing behaviours and user profiles had on the ads that popped up but they were not expecting what they found: gender discrimination was baked right into the user experience. The researchers concluded: “Setting the gender to female resulted in getting fewer instances of an ad related to high-paying jobs than setting it to male”. Similarly, a 2015 study from the University of Washington found that despite 27 per cent of chief executive titles being held by women, a search for “CEO” using Google’s images tab returned results of which only 11 per cent depicted women. What is going on here? Is Google evil? Are there sexist advertisers at work? Or is the algorithm to blame? Algorithms work on a “if a, then b” basis, carrying out instructions when provided with a set of rules to follow. Algorithms, by their nature, are quite literally logical, however, the results they produce can be unfair, biased, and downright discriminatory. This is why the Russian developers behind the hugely popular FaceApp were accused of creating a racist algorithm: a feature of the app that “beautifies” the user’s headshots also automatically lightens skin tone. Did the developers write their racist version of beauty into the code? Accusations of racist algorithms also surfaced at Google in 2015 when its Photos app tagged two African American users as gorillas. Shortly thereafter Google Photos lead Bradley Horowitz said the incident was “one of the worst days of my professional life” adding that Google needed a more diverse team in order to prevent something similar happening again. ‘Risk score’ This kind of bias can also occur where important decisions are made based on statistical analysis of large data sets in areas as diverse as personal finance, healthcare, job application processing and the legal system. In some US states, for example, analytics software is used to predict an individual’s likelihood of re-offending and this “risk score” can be applied when setting parole conditions, bail, or the length of incarceration. The problem is that these algorithms “may exacerbate unwarranted and unjust disparities that are already far too common in [the] criminal justice system,” according to former US attorney general Eric Holder. One software company in particular, Northpointe, calculated its rick score in part using questions including, “Was one of your parents ever sent to jail or prison?” and “How many of your friends/acquaintances are taking drugs illegally?” ProPublica, a non-profit investigative journalism organisation, reported that these questions, based on demographic and socioeconomic factors, could be seen as disproportionately impacting upon African Americans. Northpointe founder Tim Brennan has since announced that the company is working on developing a score that doesn’t compute for criminality based on a disadvantaged background. If these algorithms are producing biased results, are biased programmers always the problem? Not necessarily. In a paper exploring this problem, researchers at Eurecat – the Catalonian Centre for Technology – in Spain and the Institute for Scientific Interchange in Italy, agreed that “algorithmic bias exists even when there is no discrimination intention in the developer of the algorithm”. State braced for ‘crucial test’ of computer security Beware of web services whose real product is you Facial-recognition software and our fear of ‘Big Brother’ In the case of the US criminal justice system, because there is such a large database of criminals along with records of their re-offences, these records themselves are being mined for patterns in order to come up with parole recommendations. “Instead of trying to come up with a set of rules that says it is, for example, a combination of demographic information, behaviours, gender, seriousness of the crime, etc, there’s enough statistical patterns emerging from the raw data that there is no need to codify this manually,” says Prof Alan Smeaton, director of the Insight Centre for Data Analytics at Dublin City University. “In this situation, when statistics become your friend, when there is that volume of data, there can’t be such a thing as algorithmic bias when the data doesn’t lie. Or so we thought.” Underlying presumption The underlying presumption about taking data driven approaches, says Smeaton, is that all data points are created equally – and they are not. A famous example of this mistaken belief that correlation between data sets equals causation is the tongue-in-cheek University of Edinburgh study linking higher chocolate consumption to serial killer activity. These scientists pulled in data on chocolate consumption per capita globally and found a significant correlation between this and the number of serial killers per capita. Imagine implementing a policy on banning chocolate based on this, they scoffed. Now imagine similar statistical methods being employed to determine if you get parole or not. So rather than thinking of an algorithm itself as biased, it is important to understand that the bias could already reside within the data sources it uses. Smeaton points out that all of these sectors have moved from one extreme of making decisions manually to blindly using big data: “Both approaches offer distinct advantages but we haven’t yet found the sweet spot between the manual coding and the entirely data-driven approach.” The FaceApp developers trained their algorithm on a data set that most likely only included the faces of Caucasian Russians. Google Photos was developed at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, where staff hadn’t thought to include more diverse images while training their particular object detection software. The algorithm is only as good as the data. “Algorithms simply grind out their results, and it is up to humans to review and address how that data is presented to users, to ensure the proper context and application of that data,” says Keith Kirkpatrick, founder of 4K Research & Consulting. ‘Flavours’ of machine learning This means there is an onus on software developers to actively detect and work to eliminate inherent biases in the data. This responsibility breaks down not just to the algorithms they use but also the particular “flavours” of machine learning or other forms of AI they may be using, says Smeaton. “Developers need to be constantly revising and have oversight of the data sources that are then used as the input into the algorithm,” he explains. There is no silver bullet for eliminating sexist ads or racist software. On the one hand, it should be as simple as ensuring more and better data is constantly fed into these algorithms to improve machine learning but on the other, we need to recognise what “better” is and design for this. As Horowitz says, it may involve more diversity in technology companies because a largely homogenous workplace is not as likely to spot these implicit biases. But what if algorithms are part of the solution rather than the problem? If we look at advertising or the legal system before the advent of computing, bias already existed in spades. Whether it is the explicit bias of an advertiser choosing what demographic they want to target for their product or the implicit bias of middle-class, educated, mostly-white judges issuing prison sentences, it is very difficult to exclude some sort of human bias in a decision-making process, explains Smeaton. Algorithms are a way of codifying, or putting into code, and thus creating explicit rules for decision making, says Smeaton; seeing these rules laid bare before us in code can actually help us spot unconscious biases and come up with counter rules against them. Algorithmic bias may be a blessing in disguise because it puts a spotlight on all-too human prejudices by reproducing and even amplifying them on a large scale. By learning a lesson from this it may be difficult but not impossible to code for a fairer world.       Topics: Data Privacy Alan Smeaton Eric Holder Keith Kirkpatrick Tim Brennan Catalonian Centre For Technology Dublin City University Insight Centre For Data Analytics Institute For Scientific Interchange Tongue In Cheek University Of Edinburgh University Of Washington Faceapp Google California Italy Mountain View Spain United States Read More Data holds key to tackling violence against women Dara Murphy confident US will recognise EU data privacy concerns CCTV grant scheme focuses on fighting rural crime Carlow’s Netwatch taps into US demand for remote security Primary school pupils’ data held to ransom by hackers Cold-calls given the heave-ho with big data technology  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Green Property optimisitic on Brexit opportunities Technology Dash gets Pro upgrade, encourages you to ditch the smartphone Golf 1:35 Police dashcam footage shows Tiger Woods struggling to walk Innovation The shortlist for ‘The Irish Times’ Innovation awards is revealed Sponsored The Story of Home: a potter’s life Life through a lens: Samsung S8 brings photography to next level The Story of Home: A Kerry mountain retreat Truth serum: how serums won a place in our beauty regimes Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Below, we’ve embedded the full audio of the interview from our podcast Recode Replay and the full video. We’re posting all the other sessions from Code to that feed on Apple Podcasts, Google Play Music, Spotify (mobile only), TuneIn and Stitcher. Kara Swisher: So now, we’re going to do an interview we’re very excited about. Walter, why don’t you ... Walt Mossberg: Uh, we are just ... I’m just going to do it. Hillary Clinton. [applause, cheers, Katy Perry plays, laughter] Swisher: I think they voted for you, I think they did, a lot of these people [HRC laughs]. Before we start, there’s a distillery in Washington, D.C. and I’ve heard you like whiskey. Mossberg: There is? In Washington? Swisher: Yes, there’s a new distillery. Hillary Clinton: I’ve been known to, yeah, right [laughter]. Swisher: So we brought you Rodham Rye [HRC laughs], which is — people see it? — it’s actually Hillary Clinton rye made for you. Yes, that’s what they told me. Swisher: And if you’d like a drink at anytime during this ... [laughter]. Well ... Mossberg: We brought cups. Swisher: Now let’s just get the alt right platform — Hillary Clinton has a drinking problem [HRC laughs]. But if you’d like a drink at any point, this is for you to take home. Well you know, it may depend upon how the interview goes. Swisher: Ok, all right. We’ll just put it right here, just go, “Give me a shot.” Yeah, but I was thrilled. I mean, hey, not in the White House but Rodham Rye is on the shelves. [laughter] Swisher: All right, great! Mossberg: It seems like a fair trade-off, I don’t know. Well, you know, you gotta take what you can get. Mossberg: So, we’re going to talk a lot about tech and politics and tech in our country, your views on it. We were talking backstage and I think this was the first election where tech sort of got weaponized in a way that directly affected the outcome of the election ... I agree. Mossberg: ... and I know you have stuff to say about it. But I have to ask you first, discounting all those outside forces which were obviously very important, what misjudgement did you make, and your staff, that thinking about it was something serious and that you wish you had done the opposite? Well you know, I’m writing a whole book, Walt ... Mossberg: Well I don’t want to wait for the book. Yeah, we don’t probably have enough time for everything, but look. The overriding issue that affected the election that I had any control over — because I had no control over the Russians, too bad about that, but we’ll talk about it, I hope — was the way that the use of my email account was turned into the biggest scandal since lord knows when. And you know, in the book I’m just using everything that anybody else said about it besides me to basically say this was the biggest nothing-burger ever. It was a mistake, I’ve said it was a mistake, and obviously if I could turn the clock back, I wouldn’t have done it in the first place, but the way that it was used was very damaging. Swisher: And you didn’t handle it? That’s a mistake on your part? Or they way it was used was a mistake on your part? Because we’re trying to get at what you think you misjudged. Well, if you went all the way back, doing something that others had done before was no longer acceptable in the new environment in which we found ourselves. And there was no law against it, there was no rule, nothing of that sort. So I didn’t break any rule, nobody said, “Don’t do this,” and I was very responsible and not at all careless. So you end up with a situation that is then exploited, and very effectively, for adverse political reasons. And it was maddening, because in the middle of a hard-fought campaign, it’s hard to stop and say, “Wait a minute, what you think you know about this is not accurate, let me tell you. You can still judge me, you can still hold me accountable, that’s fair game.” But there was so much else going on at that time. And the investigation that they conducted ended in July, it was over, and I have my complaints about former director Comey, but it was done. And then it was reignited and it became the major reason toward the end, based on the best analysis that I can find, that I lost ground and ended up losing. So obviously, turn the clock back. But what was done, and I think it was interesting, I know you had Dean Baquet here from the New York Times yesterday, and they covered it like it was Pearl Harbor. And then in their endorsement of me, they said, “This email thing, it’s like a help desk issue.” So it was always a hard issue to put to bed, but we put it to bed in July and then it rose up again. Mossberg: Okay, I want to do one more of these misjudgement things and then we’re going to go on. Goldman Sachs. Yeah. Mossberg: You knew you were going to run for president, or you thought you might, or probably, you were thinking about it — you had to be thinking about it as a possibility — why did you do those? Why do you have Goldman Sachs here? [laughter] Swisher: Because they pay us. They paid me [laughter and applause]. You know, look, again ... Mossberg: Let’s get serious ... But ... Mossberg: I know they paid you ... Yes. Mossberg: And they paid you a lot. Yes, yes. Mossberg: But you’re not somebody who needed that money for the next week’s shopping, and you knew you might run, so why do it? Well, I gave speeches to many, many groups. I spoke to camp counselors, I spoke to health-care executives, I spoke to, you know, just a wide range of groups, right? And not just in the United States but particularly in Canada and a few other places. And I was a Senator from New York. I knew these people and I knew what they did for the economy and I knew what they did to the economy. And I think that speaking to them, raising questions — which I did in 2008 and 2009 — you know, people have no reason to know this, but in the 2008 campaign before the Iowa caucus, I actually ran an ad about the looming mortgage crisis. So I have to say, Walt, I never thought that anybody would throw out my entire career of standing up and speaking out and voting against and voting in favor of what I thought are good policies, because I made a couple of speeches. When you’re the Secretary of State, people want to hear what you talk about. The most common thing that I talked about in all those speeches was the hunt for Bin Laden. You know, that was one of the central missions that I felt from the time the towers fell on 9/11 as a Senator from New York. And to be part of that, to be one of the very few people advising the president on that, that was a fascinating issue. And I thought I could tell that to a lot of different people, and you know, men got paid for the speeches they made. I got paid for the speeches I made. And it was used, and I thought it was unfairly used and all of that, but it was part of the background music. Swisher: So let’s talk about that ... but it was used. And I think we’ve discussed this, you and I have discussed this, this idea of ... how many years did you talk about the vast right-wing conspiracy? Um, about ... let’s see, it was probably ’98? Swisher: And at the time people thought you were ... A little crazy [laughter]. Swisher: Right, okay. [WM laughs]. What is it like now? How do you look at it now? Because it is used. Because you’re someone that’s got to know that a target’s on your back almost every ... You know, right now every bot in Russia is working their way with the last 20 seconds of things you said. Yes, right. Well I hope we get into this because look, I take responsibility for every decision I made, but that’s not why I lost. So I think it’s important that we learn the real lessons from this last campaign because the forces that we are up against are not just interested in influencing our elections and our politics, they’re going after our economy and they’re going after our unity as a nation. So yes, back in ’98 — look, I have been watching this and have been, obviously, the target for a number of years. And what is hard for people to really — although now after the election there’s greater understanding — is that there are forces in our country — put the Russians to one side — who have been fighting rear-guard actions for as long as I’ve been alive, because my life coincided with the Civil Rights movement, with the Women’s Rights movement, with anti-war protesting, with the impeachment ... you know, the driving out of office because he was about to be impeached president ... Swisher: Let’s be specific. Yeah, let’s be very specific as if people didn’t understand what I was saying [laughter]. And let’s talk about, you know, Watergate and all the stuff that we lived through. And we were on a real roll as a country despite assassinations, despite setbacks. You know, opening the doors of opportunity, expanding rights to people who never had them in any country, was frankly thrilling. And I believed then, and I believe now, that we’re never done with this work. And so part of the challenge is to maintain the energy and the focus to keep going forward. But you’ve got to recognize the other side is never, never tired either. They’re always looking to push back. And what we saw was, in the election particularly, and I appreciate what Walt said, the first time that you had the tech revolution really weaponized politically — before it was a way to reach voters, you know, collect fundraising, do things that would help the candidate who was behind the messaging — that changed this time, and it changed for a number of reasons we should talk about. You had Citizens United come to its full fruition. So unaccountable money flowing in against me, against other Democrats, in a way that we hadn’t seen and then attached to this weaponized information war. You had effective suppression of votes. Those of us who can remember the Voting Rights Act, the expansion of the franchise, and then I was in the Senate when we voted 98 to nothing under a Republican president, George W. Bush, to extend the Voting Rights Act. And the Supreme Court said, “Oh, we don’t need it anymore,” throws it out, and Republican governors and legislatures began doing everything they could to suppress the vote. So, that was before we get to the Russians, or Cambridge Analitica, or anything of the outside. And there were lots of factors at work and yeah, it was aimed at me, but it’s a much deeper, more persistent effort to try to literally turn the clock back on so much of what we’ve achieved as a country. Swisher: So talk about the weaponizing of it. Because one of the things that’s interesting ... Now you’ve recently, and we’ve talked about the uses of Facebook, the uses of — we can get into Donald Trump’s Twitter thing in a second, because that can be a whole conference, essentially. But how do you see how it was weaponized, and it begs the questions, why weren’t you weaponizing it? Like, why is the right wing so good at it? Mossberg: And not just you, but the Democrats. Well, look. Here’s how I see it, and I hope others will jump into this debate in the months ahead because there’s a lot we have to understand if we’re going to avoid this continuing assault on our sources of information. Here’s how I think about it. You know, I was very proud of my data and analytics team. They were largely veterans of the Obama campaigns, ’08, ’12, and then we brought in new people and brought in a lot of new expertise to build the next generation. And we had a lot of help from some people in Silicon Valley as well. And what we thought we were doing — here’s the arena we were playing in — was going to like Obama 3.0, you know, better targeting, better messaging, and the ability to both turn out our voters as we identified them, and to communicate more broadly with voters. Here’s what the other side was doing, and they were in a different arena. Through content farms, through an enormous investment in falsehoods, fake news, call it what you will ... Mossberg: How about “lies”? Lies? You’re really ... that’s a good word too [laughter and applause]. The other side was using content that was just flat-out false, and delivering it in a very personalized way, both sort of above the radar screen and below. And you know, look, I’m not a tech expert by any stretch of the imagination. That really influenced the information that people were relying on. And there have been some studies done since the election that if you look — let’s pick Facebook. If you look at Facebook, the vast majority of the news items posted were fake. They were connected to, as we now know, the 1,000 Russian agents who were involved in delivering those messages. They were connected to the bots that are just out of control. We see now this new information about Trump’s Twitter account being populated by millions of bots. And it was such a new experience. I understand why people on their Facebook pages would think, “Oh, Hillary Clinton did that, I did not know that. Well that’s going to affect my opinion about her.” And we did not engage in false content. We may have tried to put every piece of information in the best possible light, and explanations, but we weren’t in the same category as the other side. Mossberg: But, okay. So you weren’t going to lie. Right. Mossberg: Good for you. Well ... Yes ... [laughter] Mossberg: I see you’re rethinking that [laughs]. I’m not rethinking it, but everybody else better rethink it, because we have to figure out how to combat this. Mossberg: Okay, but that’s my point. My impression is that the left, the Democrats, liberals, whatever you want to call them, including Bernie Sanders’s folks and everybody on the Democratic side, which at once time, 12, 15 years ago, was ahead of the Republicans on tech as it existed then, is way behind now. Yeah, yeah. Mossberg: And it’s not just ... I mean, there’s a way to weaponize tech that doesn’t involve lying. Right. Mossberg: Or having Russians help you. But it is a political weapon, it’s a fact of life now. Swisher: So how do you do that? Mossberg: How do you do it? How do we do it going forward? Let me just do a comparison for you. I set up my campaign and we have our own data operation. I get the nomination. So I’m now the nominee of the Democratic Party. I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party. Mossberg: What do you mean nothing? I mean it was bankrupt, it was on the verge of insolvency, its data was mediocre to poor, nonexistent, wrong. I had to inject money into it ... Mossberg: This is the DNC you’re talking about. The DNC, to keep it going. Okay. Donald Trump, who did nothing about really setting up any kind of data operation, inherits an RNC data foundation that, after the Republicans lost in 2012, and they thought they had a very good operation with the setup that Romney did called ORCA, they thought that was really state of the art, they lose. So they raised — best estimates are close to a hundred million dollars, they brought in their main vendors, they basically said, “We will never be behind the Democrats again,” and they invested between 2012 and 2016 this hundred million dollars to build this data foundation. They beta tested it. They ran it ... somebody was able to determine about 227,000 surveys to double check, triple check, quadruple check, the information. So Trump becomes the nominee and he is basically handed this tried and true, effective foundation. Then you’ve got Cambridge Analytica and you know, you can believe the hype on how great they were or the hype on how they weren’t, but the fact is, they added something. And I think again, we better understand that the Mercers did not invest all that money just for their own amusement. We know they played in Brexit, and we know that they came to Jared Kushner and basically said, “We will marry our operation,” which was more as it’s been described, psychographic, sentiment, a lot of harvesting of Facebook information, “We will marry that with the RNC on two conditions: You pick Steve Bannon, and you pick Kellyanne Conway. And then we’re in.” Trump says, “Fine, who cares,” right? So Bannon, who’d been running the Breitbart operation, supplying a lot of the ... untrue, false stories ... Mossberg: You gotta start saying lies. Yeah. We know. So, they married content with delivery and data. And it was a potent combination. Now, the question is, where and how did the Russians get into this? And I think it’s a very important question. So, I assume that a lot of people here may have — and if you haven’t, I hope you will — read the declassified report by the Intelligence community that came out in early January. Mossberg: This is 17 agencies ... Seventeen agencies, all in agreement, which I know from my experience as a Senator and Secretary of State, is hard to get. They concluded with high confidence that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign, to influence voters in the election. They did it through paid advertising we think, they did it through false news sites, they did it through these thousand agents, they did it through machine learning, which you know, kept spewing out this stuff over and over again. The algorithms that they developed. So that was the conclusion. And I think it’s fair to ask, how did that actually influence the campaign? And how did they know what messages to deliver? Swisher: Who told them? Who told them? Who were they coordinating with, or colluding with? Because the Russians historically in the last couple of decades and then increasingly, you know, are launching cyber attacks, and they are stealing vasts amounts of information, and a lot of the information they’ve stolen they’ve used for internal purposes, to affect markets, to affect the intelligence services, etc. So this is different because they went public, and they were conveying this weaponized information and the content of it, and they were running ... You know, there’s all these stories of guys over in Macedonia who are running these fake news sites and I’ve seen them now and you sit there and it looks like a sort of low-level CNN operation ... Mossberg: Or a fake newspaper. Or a fake newspaper ... Mossberg: Like the Denver Guardian. Like a fake newspaper, and so the Russians — in my opinion and based on the intel and the counterintel people I’ve talked to — could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided. Mossberg: Guided by Americans. Guided by Americans and guided by people who had polling and data information. Swisher: Who is that? Now let me just finish, because this is the second and third step. So we know that they did that. We understand it. Best example: So within one hour, one hour of the Access Hollywood tapes being leaked, within one hour, the Russians — let’s say WikiLeaks, something — dumped the John Podesta emails. Now, if you’ve ever read the John Podesta emails, they are anodyne to boredom [laughter]. But ... Mossberg: Yeah, we had him here once. Yeah, [laughter and applause], and forgive him for what he said about you. So, they were run-of-the-mill emails, especially run of the mill for a campaign. “Should we do this?” “What should she say?” You know, just the stuff that is so common, basic. Within one hour they dumped them, and then they began to weaponize them. And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like Infowars, take out pieces and begin to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you could imagine. And so they had to be ready for that, and they had to have a plan for that, and they had to be given the go-ahead. “Okay, this could be the end of the Trump campaign, dump it now. And then let’s do everything we can to weaponize it.” And we know it hurt us. Because as I explain in my book, you know, the Comey letter, which was, now we know, partly based on a false memo from the Russians. It was a classic piece of Russian disinformation — comprimat, they call it. So, for whatever reason, and I speculate, but I can’t look inside the guy’s mind, you know, he dumps that on me on October 28th, and I immediately start falling. But what was really interesting, since the mainstream media covered that, as I say like Pearl Harbor, front pages everywhere, huge type, etc. And all of the Trump people go around screaming, “Lock her up, lock her up,” and all of that. At the same time, the biggest Google searches were not for Comey, because that information was just lying out there, it was for WikiLeaks. And so voters who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up their minds. What does it mean? And we know that the Google searches for this stuff were particularly high in places in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Swisher: So, a couple of questions to this. That was fascinating actually. I was like riveted to that. Who was directing them, from your perspective? And do you blame — and I’m just going to use Facebook, because that’s where a lot of this was done, especially around the fake news, either the Pope was voting for Trump, or there was one particular one I got in an argument with Facebook people about, you being a lizard, that was going around. And they kept arguing about the gray area and this and that, and I remember being in a call saying, “She’s not a lizard!” Thank you, Kara, thank you [laughter]. Mossberg: That’s actually a kind thing from Kara. I’m very touched! Swisher: But ... [laughter] do you blame ... I have that on a pillow, “She’s not a lizard.” Swisher: I don’t know if you’re a lizard or not but ... [HRC laughs] I’m guessing you’re not a lizard. But who do you think directed it? And do you blame Facebook, or any of these platforms, for doing nothing? What should they have done and are they culpable? Let me separate out the questions. First, we’re getting more information about all of the contacts between Trump campaign officials and Trump associates with Russians before, during and after the election. So I hope that we’ll get enough information to be able to answer that question. Swisher: But you’re leaning Trump. Yes ... yes. I’m leaning Trump. I think it’s pretty hard not to. I think that the marriage of the domestic fake news operations, the domestic RNC Republican allied data, you know, combined with the very affective capabilities that the Russians brought. You know, basically the group running this was the GRU which is the military intelligence arm of the Russian military and they have a very sophisticated cyber operation, in bed with WikiLeaks, in bed with Goosefer, in bed with DC Leaks. And you know, DC Leaks and Goosefer, which were dropping a lot of this stuff on me, they haven’t done anything since early January. Their job was done. They got their job done. So we’re going to, I hope, be able to connect up a lot of the dots, and it’s really important because when Comey did testify before being fired this last couple of weeks, he was asked, “Are the Russians still involved?” And he goes, “Yes, they are. Look, why wouldn’t they be? It worked for them!” And it is important that Americans, and particularly people in tech and business understand, Putin wants to bring us down. And he is an old KGB agent. I had, obviously, run-ins with him, because that in large measure prompted his animus toward me, and his desire to help Trump. But it is deeper than that, it is way beyond me. So with respect to the platforms, you know, I am again not exactly sure what conclusions we should draw. But here’s what I believe. I believe that what was happening to me was unprecedented and we were scrambling. We went and told everybody we could find in the middle of the summer, the Russians were messing with the election. And we were basically shooed away, like, “Oh you know, there she goes, vast right-wing conspiracy.” Now it’s a vast Russian conspiracy. Well, turned out we were right. And we saw evidence of it. We could track it. And we couldn’t get ... we could not get the press to follow it and we never got confirmation. Remember, Comey was more than happy to talk about my emails, but he wouldn’t talk about the investigation of the Russians. So people went to vote on November 8th having no idea that there was an active counter-intelligence investigation going on of the Trump campaign. So if I put myself in the position of running a platform like Facebook, first of all, they’ve got to get back to trying to curate it more effectively. Put me out of the equation, they’ve got to help prevent fake news from creating a new reality. That does influence how people think of themselves, see the world, the decisions that they make. I don’t know enough about what they could have done in real time. It’s not like we were not having conversations with them, because a lot of the people on my team were. I also think I was the victim of a very broad assumption I was going to win. “It doesn’t matter what you do to her ...” Swisher: Victim that you were going to win ... Yeah, just you know, everybody. Mossberg: You’re talking about Nate Silver and the Times. “She has an 88 percent ... No she has an 89 percent chance.” Yeah. And you know, I never believed that, I always thought it was going to be a close election because our elections are always close. And you know, if you have an R next to your name or a D next to your name, you end up often falling in line to vote for your candidate. So I think a lot of people ... “We’ll get to that after the election. We’re not going to worry about it right now.” And that turned out to be a terrible mistake. Swisher: So a victim that they thought you were going to win ... So what’s the difference? Well, I think that was part of it. Swisher: What about a financial element? That they made money from this? Oh I think... Well, look. The networks made more money than they’ve made in years, and we’ve got lots of network executives saying things like, “You know, he may not be good for the country but he’s good for business.” And there was that. And putting him on all the time. Calling in wherever he was from. And here’s a really telling statistic that has been validated. So, I had this old-fashioned idea that it really mattered what I would do as president [laughter]. And so I laid out very specific plans and I costed them out because I also think it’s important to be fiscally responsible. A number of people in this audience were helpful to me, and I thank you. And we had a really good ... we had a great tech program. We had a really good set of policies. Okay. In 2008, which was the last time you had a contested election, not somebody already in the White House, the policies put forth by President Obama, Senator McCain, got 220 minutes of air time, okay? In 2016, despite my best efforts and giving endless speeches and putting out all kinds of stuff, we got 32 minutes. That’s all. Mossberg: Total? Total. Mossberg: Over like two years, or how long was ...? Well, over 18 months. Yeah. That was it. Total. Swisher: So does that signify that you need to think about campaign ... Not you in particular. Are you running again, by the way? No. Swisher: Okay. But you need to campaign differently, because you know, you were saying policy doesn’t matter, politics did. And Donald Trump ... Look, a lot of people say that he was a great campaigner, a bad president. You were a terrible campaigner, you would have been a great president kind of thing. But you have to win and not ... Look, let’s put the campaigning stuff on the table ... Swisher: But don’t you have to change? Or not? I won three million more votes than the other guy did [cheers, applause]. And I had a very, very close contest. Basically our votes were neck and neck. He ended up with more delegates and you know, depending on how you counted, I was slightly ahead, slightly behind. So we were absolutely on par when it came to actually getting votes. I won two Senate races in New York. So I never said I was a perfect candidate, and I certainly have never said I ran perfect campaigns, but I don’t know who is or did. And at some point it sort of bleeds into misogyny. And let’s just be honest, you know, people who have ... [applause] a set of expectations about who should be president and what a president looks like, you know, they’re going to be much more skeptical and critical of somebody who doesn’t look like and talk like and sound like everybody else who’s been president. And you know, President Obama broke that racial barrier, but you know, he’s a very attractive, good-looking man with lots of ... Swisher: Well, he’s likable enough. He’s likable enough, absolutely! [WM laughs] More than, more than. So the campaign ... Look, were there things we could have done differently? You can say that about any campaign. Swisher: But is campaigning going to change in the future? Mossberg: Yeah, but I want to ... I want to follow up on something while we’re on this bleeding over into misogyny thing, and it comes from the recent New York Magazine profile of you, which I thought was fascinating and interesting. But the part of it that just leapt off the page for me as a reader was you and some of your staff, folks were quoted in there as saying, “Okay, Bernie Sanders could get angry at the podium about the fate of the people who are trapped in the globalization/automation thing.” Trump certainly did that, oversimplifying, getting angry. You couldn’t do that because you’re a woman. And if a woman does that, it just backfires on her. And it made me think, are we never going to be able to have a woman in politics who can use that technique, which is an effective technique, which shows I’m emotionally with you just by oversimplifying and getting angry. Is that true? Do you really feel you couldn’t do that? Well, let me say this. You know, I have been on many speaking platforms with many men who are in office or running for office. And the crowd gets you going and you get up there and I watch my male counterparts and they beat the podium and they yell and the crowd loves it. And a few times I’ve tried then and it’s been less than successful, let me just say that [laughter]. And it’s a little maddening because I’m as angry about what’s going on as anybody because I’ve seen us go backwards as I said in the very beginning about so many things. Economic opportunity, advancements in human rights, civils rights, and the rest. Swisher: Health care. Health care. I care deeply about this. And I remember when I was doing health care back in the day, ’93, ’94, and we were trying to move an agenda forward and I went to the American Academy of Pediatrics. And I’ve always been particularly concerned about what happens to kids who don’t get the health care they need. Mossberg: Right. And I gave a really hot speech, and I got hammered for it, repeatedly. Because I don’t know what the way forward will be for others, Walt, but for me, trying to convey my commitment, my lifelong commitment, and not only that, what I’ve done. And you know, I’d put up against anybody who ran, or thought of running, what I’ve already accomplished compared to what they have on behalf of people. It just is very difficult to go from intensity, passion, emotion, to anger. So, yeah. Try and stay on the other side of that line. Swisher: So spinning it forward, what do you think a Democrat ... how do you assess the current Democratic scene in terms of tech, and also what will happen with this Russian investigation? I’m not going to speculate on who might end up running. We have to first win elections in New Jersey and Virginia in 2017, we’ve got to take the House back and keep our incumbents and maybe make progress in the Senate. Everything will change if we win in 2018. Mossberg: Do you really believe we can? Yes I do. Mossberg: I say “we,” I’m retiring soon. Yeah, we. Yes. Mossberg: We [laughter] can take the House back? [applause] Yes. Mossberg: We’ve got 20-something Senate seats that we have to defend. I mean seriously, come on. You’re really smart about this. Let’s be honest. Let’s look at the House. We have to flip 24 seats, okay? I won 23 districts that have a Republican Congress member. Seven of them are in California, Darrell Issa being one. If we can flip those, if we can then go deeper into where I did well, where we can get good candidates, I think flipping the House is certainly realistic. It’s a goal that we can set for ourselves. Mossberg: Is the party organized to do that? Well, we’re working on it. I’m working on it. Mossberg: We don’t have a lot of time here. Well you know, but we’ve got two very good political strategists running the Senate and the House for Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. They know how to win elections. They’re incredibly focused, tireless and effective. So honestly, I’m hopeful about the House. And I’m working on it. I have a new organization called Onward Together and I’m helping some of these new groups that have sprouted up online to recruit candidates, run candidates, help candidates go to town halls, expose Republican members for their hypocrisy and the like. So we’re working really hard on this. Mossberg: What about the Senate? I think the Senate is hard to make progress, but I think it’s possible to hold our own. All of this depends on what we’re talking about. So if the Republicans continue to make progress as they are in going into the next generation of personalization, message delivery, phony stories ... Go to Netflix and say you want to see a political documentary, eight of the top 10 — last time I checked a few weeks ago — were screeds against President Obama or me, or both of us. Now, I love Netflix. We’re not making the documentaries that we’re going to get onto Netflix. Mossberg: This is because Hollywood isn’t liberal enough? [laughter] No, it’s because Democrats aren’t putting their money there. You know, there’s a classic line. Democrats give money to candidates, they want a personal connection. So the classic line is Democrats like to fall in love, Republicans just fall in line. Republicans build institutions, Republicans invest in those institutions, Republicans are much more willing to push and cross the line, and Democrats ... I’ve talked to dozens of donors since my election experience and I’ve said, “Look, I’m all for you trying to figure out who you’re going to support in 2020, but what about 2017 and what about 2018 and what about helping the DNC try to leapfrog over its horrible data deficit, and how about supporting some of these new groups and see what they can do to generate some activity?” We are not good historically at building institutions. And we’ve got to get a lot better. And that includes content. We have a great story to tell. You know, I found when I started the campaign that I had to say in practically everyone of my speeches, “Barack Obama save the economy, and he doesn’t get the credit he deserves.” I had to say that because people had been told differently. They didn’t feel it yet. You know, income didn’t really start inching up until 2015, late 2015. Mossberg: Right. So I was swimming against an historic tide. It’s very difficult historically to succeed a two-term president of your own party, because you know, we’re itchy people, we like change in American, and I get it. So there was that, but he had done a good job. And you know, it was comparable ... I obviously think back to what my husband inherited, which at that time seemed to be an exploding deficit and an increasing debt. The debt of the country had been quadrupled the prior 12 years. So he had to do a lot of cleanup work, he paid a huge political price for it, lost the Congress in ’94, had to fight back for getting reelected, and then we all know what happened in the second term which was bloodsport of the worse kind. And then the Supreme Court, despite Al Gore winning 500,000 more votes rules for Bush. So Bush comes in, and I worked closely with him on 9/11, but honestly the financial crisis, the morass in Iraq, and a lot of the other decisions that were made were very damaging. So then we elect President Obama, he comes in, he inherits the worst economy since the Great Depression, and he has to do a lot of things that are not easy to get it back and moving. And it was like, “Okay, thank you very much, let’s get excited about somebody who’s going to really stir us up as opposed to do the job that needs to be done now.” Mossberg: Great analysis on the congressional at the national level [applause]. Let’s move down ballot for a second. One of the things that just depresses me all the time is where are the Democrats running ... You know, they’re mad at everybody. Every Democrat, every liberal, lots of moderates, even some moderate Republicans, are scared and angry about Trump. Right, right. Mossberg: I don’t see him running for school board, I don’t see him running for city council, I don’t see him running for state legislature ... That’s starting to change, Walt. It really is. I’ve got every finger and toe crossed. So among the groups I’m supporting is a group called Run For Something, started by a young woman who worked for me and my campaign. And they’ve had thousands of people go on the website to try to figure out what does it mean to run and then to put in information, “Here’s what I’m thinking of.” And they’re beginning to win some races. Another group that’s been around for a longer time called Emerge America supports women who run. Their grassroots operations invested in women in Nevada, we flipped both houses. I won Nevada, we won the House and the Senate of Nevada. So they’re playing catch-up and trying to be more progressive and smart about their policies. You’re absolutely right. We used to leave so many races uncontested, and we’re not going to do that anymore. Swisher: So when you think about that ... One of the things that we were also talking about last night is Republicans own local television stations, they own radio, they’re better at the internet, that got that cable going — although there’s some issues they have over there at Fox News these days. What do you do then? Where do you leapfrog? Because obviously the internet is the best way to leapfrog that. And let’s be honest, you have Hollywood on your side. There’s a progressive media, most people think of the media as progressive. Well you don’t, you think it’s not. Like the New York Times for example. Mossberg: The false equivalency. The false equivalency. Swisher: Right, we try to be fair. Mossberg: I sense that that’s changing. I hope so. Mossberg: That memo has been received. I hope so. Because what ... Swisher: So where’s the in? Technologically? This goes back to the institution building. Because the media forces on the Republican side are entrenched and very effective. So you’ve got obviously Fox, but you also now have Sinclair buying 140-plus local stations. And they’re beginning to call the shots on those local stations. Swisher: Give the example of Montana we talked about. Yeah, well so you know Montana, those of you who saw the now newly elected member of Congress literally beating up, body slamming, pushing around, a young reporter, you know what happened. You know that it had a really terrible look to it. The guy should never have been doing that. I don’t know what enraged him so much being asked about health care. Sort of a strange trigger [laughter]. So the NBC affiliate in Montana, can’t remember which city, Missoula or Billings. Anyway, they’ve just been bought by Sinclair. So the NBC mothership in New York calls this station and says, “Can you send us the footage of what happened?” They said, “No, because that reporter was from a liberal paper, and we don’t think it’s a story we want to be part of.” Now, I find that terrifying. Because local news, yeah, there is the internet and how important it is and everybody who gets their news off of the internet, but local TV is still incredibly powerful. Mossberg: So what are we going to do about it? Well I’ve been ... Swisher: You and Walt, what are you going to do about it? Well I mean, we have a few ... Mossberg: I’ve got some time now. You would be a great adviser to one or more of our tech billionaires who want to buy some media. Mossberg: Eh, they don’t listen to me. Well then, we’re going to have to find other people who will compete against what is a considerable advantage on the other side. Swisher: What do you think about Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post? I think that Jeff Bezos saves the Washington Post. I think his purchasing the Washington Post ... [applause] Which you know, I think a lot of people, a lot of his peers and friends thought, “Why would you buy this ancient medium called a newspaper?” But newspapers, like the Post, the Journal, the Times, a few others, still drive news. Drives news online, drives news on TV. And what Bezos has done, from what I’m told, and Walt and I were talking about this backstage, you know, he’s interested in making it a good proposition, but he’s hands off on the editorial and content front and he’s basically said, “Get out there and do investigations,” and they’re doing some of the best investigations about what’s going on with the White House now. So I think that was really a very good use of his financial resources because now we have a very good newspaper again operating in Washington and driving news elsewhere and doing kind of Whitewater-level investigations. Swisher: So we have to get to questions from the audience, and I don’t think we can get into covfefe right now because it’s a longer thing [WM laughs], but ... I thought it was a hidden message to the Russians [laughter]. Swisher: Oh you did [laughs]. That is perfect, thank you so much for that. That’s going to be on our site in about five seconds [laughter]. So there’s a lot of calls. One of the things that I’m struck by is a lot of some of the articles are like, “You’ve got to stop, you’ve got to move on, you’ve got to sunset yourself and go away.” How do you ... I’m offended by it, but what do you think? Because you seem mad as ever, which I love. You know what I mean? You know, look. I’m not going anywhere [applause]. I have a big stake in what happens in this country. I am very, you know, unbowed and unbroken about what happened, because I don’t want it to happen to anybody else. I don’t want it to happen to the values and the institutions that I care about in America. And I think that we’re at a really pivotal point. And therefore I’m going to keep writing and keep talking and keep supporting people who are on the front lines of the resistance. Swisher: Terrific. Question for Hillary Clinton. Mossberg: Why don’t we start over here. Guy Horowitz: Guy Horowitz, I’m from Israel. So if it’s any comfort, we also had an election decided by an election day weaponized social media case. I don’t know if it’s comforting at all. Swisher: No it’s not, it’s worse. Horowitz: That guy also had like a very questionable hairdo. But we survived. So my question to you is ... In Israel we look at everything that’s happening outside the U.S. and what Donald Trump is saying and doing from the Paris climate thing and everything else that’s happening. It looks like it’s a clear and present danger to the world. And we’re all talking here, which is good. But I don’t feel like we’re doing enough, maybe in the U.S., definitely in the world ... Swisher: So question ... I’m sorry ... Horowitz: ... to eliminate this clear and present danger. Mossberg: And the question? Horowitz: And the question is, what can we do right now? Yeah. You know, I’m really glad you asked the question because I do think what he’s doing is very dangerous to our position in the world, our leadership, and the stability of the world. I mean, when you give a blank check to the Russians and the Saudis, and others who are in engaged in authoritarian and dictatorial regimes, you are sending a message, “We don’t care what you do.” And that message will be heard. Now, we weren’t always able to control what others did, but we sure made it clear we didn’t think it was a good idea to engage in invasions and mass murders and other things that we see from the Philippines to the Middle East. When you turn on your allies and you treat them with such disdain and contempt, our democratic NATO allies who have stood with us, who came to our aide after 9/11, you are sending a message that you don’t care about history, or even about the current problems that we face. Now, the only comfort I can get out of having lost in the way that I did and having the Russians play such a role is that Necron was ready and able to rebut that. He said, “I’m the Hillary Clinton of this election.” And they had certain institutional and media predictions that we don’t have. But he also was really smart about how he dealt with it. And it also has given a lot of good understanding to Angela Merkel and her team as she moves towards her election, okay? And I think that is important because we need to reform democracies, we need to reform economies, we need to deal with some of the issues that are coming at us like artificial intelligence and robotics and what the heck we’re going to do with all these people who are not going to have jobs. There are lots of big questions that the democratic world has to face, including Israel. But we cannot stand idly by and allow Trump to continue to undermine the very strong foundation based on values that we in democracies share. Politicians come and go, but these values and the role that they play in stabilizing the world after the worst war in humanity, is critically important. You mentioned climate change, apparently they’re debating in the White House whether to pull out of the Paris agreement. There are only two nations in the world that are not signatories to the Paris Agreement: Nicaragua and Syria. For the United States to throw our lot in with the very, very small number of countries that have turned their backs on climate change, is not only a breach of an agreement ... Usually when you come into office you can try to reform, maybe tinker with agreements, but part of what keeps us going is that America’s word is good and you stand with your prior administration, whether it was of your party or not. They’re looking to throw all that out the window. But what’s really stupid about it is they’re throwing out the economic opportunities that being part of the Paris Agreement provide for the United States. That is what I find totally incomprehensible. Now, it is going to be interesting to see where they end up. The president is a very impulsive, reactive personality. So if we all like the Paris Agreement, he may decide to get out of it. Not even understanding one bit about what that means. Or understanding the economic costs of it. You know, somebody is going to really ... probably more than one somebody, will really have the market for clean energy exports. China is moving full speed ahead to be that country. Some of the European countries, particularly when it comes to wind, are already there. Israel I know has some great research being done, particularly on solar. I mean, there’s a huge market that somebody’s going to own, and we’re giving it up. There will be entrepreneurs and businesses, you will do your best to be competitive, but you won’t have the full force and support of your government, and I think that is incredibly foolish. Swisher: All right. Short questions so we can get to them. Alexia Bonatsos: Hi Hillary. Hi. Bonatsos: I’m Alexia Bonatsos. First off, thank you so much for what you have done for women [applause]. Thank you. So the present administration is very befuddling. This morning Spicer said that only the president and a small group of people knows what covfefe means. [WM and KS laugh] You’ve been a party to a lot of classified information. Right. Bonatsos: And you were at Donald Trump’s wedding. Yeah [WM laughs]. Bonatsos: What do you know about him that we don’t, and how do you explain his bizarre behavior and appeal? [laughter, applause] Swisher: That’s such a good question! Ah, the small group explanation. You don’t have a high enough classification to know what covfefe mean [laughter]. You know, look. I was never even a social friend, it was kind of a lark to go to his third wedding [laughter, applause]. But I have to tell you, I sat behind Shaquille O’Neal, so I didn’t see anything [laughter, applause]. But, seriously. The behavior that we are now seeing was always present, but it was sort of subordinated to real estate interests, right? He started attacking Ronald Reagan in 1988. You know, “Our government is a disgrace ..." So he’s been an equal opportunity insulter going back many years. Started thinking about running for president in the ’90s. Latched onto the lie of the birther movement about President Obama, rode that as far as he could. But he does have a visceral grasp of America’s political underbelly. He really understands how to inflame people, how to motivate them, how to bond with them. Over whatever their grievance is. Whatever resentment or point of anger that you may have, if he can get into it, whether it’s race or sex or xenophobia or anti ... Islamophobia, whatever it is. And so we’re seeing it on a broader stage. And it is deeply troubling for not only our politics but for our position in the world. And I think the best thing we can do is to continue to stand up, continue to defend the truth. You know, I gave a commencement speech at my alma mater and I quoted my predecessor in the Senate, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, with that famous remark, “Everybody’s entitled to his own opinion but no one is entitled to his own facts.” And that’s why we need the media, we need the tech world, we need the online world. We need everybody to be calling them out on their outrageous lies and make it clear that we can have a debate about what is the best way to provide health care, we can have a debate about a budget, but when you present a budget with a trillion dollar mathematical error, it’s not like we’re going to ignore it. And I think the more voices that can be pushing back, especially in areas that you know things about, the better. And then I’ll just get back to politics and elections. We got to have your support here in California and across the country to try to take back the House and too, as Walt rightly says, field more people to run. And if you’ve ever been interested ... you know, Kara, if you’ve ever been interested in running, now is the time to get in there. Swisher: I’ve got it. And because I think people will be hungry for straight talking, common sense, factual information. We don’t want to act like the American public isn’t capable of making informed decisions. We just have to make sure the information we get is founded in evidence and reality. And then we can have a real debate. Swisher: And you also have to be good with the Twitter. But go ahead. Fred Davis: Hi, I’m Fred Davis, I live near you in New York. It’s the day before the election, maybe the morning of the election. From everything I’ve read, I hear you think you’re going to win. Yeah. Davis: Are those accounts accurate? Is the polling industry as inaccurate as we perceive it? And is there any quick suggestions to this crowd on how to fix it? Well, Fred, yeah, I did think I was going to win. I spent the night before the election, I started in Philadelphia. We had a 40,000-person rally with Barack and Michelle and the president had been following it closely. Those of you who know him, he was running his own polling, running his own analytics. And you know, and we thought we were going to win. That’s all I can tell you. We knew, I knew, that I’d taken a tremendous hit after the Comey letter. And then later I understood the role that WikiLeaks played in it. But the Comey letter was measurable. You could see my drop. So you know, I needed a big majority to come out of Philadelphia, which I got. Close to 500,000. And I needed about a 15 to 17 point lead to come out of the Philadelphia suburbs. Before the Comey letter, based on our polling, I had about a 22 point lead in the Philadelphia suburbs. After that letter, my momentum, particularly among women in the suburbs, stopped and dropped. So I won the suburbs, but I only won them by 10. And that wasn’t enough. I mean, Pennsylvania’s always a tough state and you’ve got to come out of the city and suburbs and Pittsburgh and a few other places. Which I won! I won Pittsburgh, I won the country there, I won Scranton, I won the county there. But I just got killed out in the country and my numbers couldn’t hold me up. So yeah, we did think... I think polling is going to have to undergo some revisions in how they actually measure people. How they reach people. The best assessments as of right now are that the polling was not that inaccurate, but it was predominantly national polling, and I won nationally. What was not as obvious was what was happening in states where I was under a lot of pressure from Comey, WIkiLeaks, voter suppression, fake news, all of that. And that’s kind of what happened. Swisher: Okay, Rob? Rob: Secretary Clinton, good to see you. Hey, Rob. Rob: As we discussed last night, you were originally on the Senate Watergate committee in the ’70s, so you know that part of it firsthand. What has to happen in 2018 to get robust activities in the House, particularly around an investigation? And to tie that back into your comments, how important is a democratic majority in your opinion to have a proper investigation into the Russia stuff and the kleptocracy and the other things that appear to be going on? Well it’s critical, Rob. Now one would hope that more Republicans, as they did during the Watergate investigation, because as Rob said, I was on the impeachment enquiry staff of the house judiciary committee, and Republicans then were not happy about investigating a president of their own party, but they were open to the evidence. And we ran under the great leadership of the late John Doar, a meticulous investigation and presentation of facts. We don’t have that right now in the Republican majority in the house, although they are continuing with the House investigation. And I’m hoping that that will building some momentum, because the Republicans have to be constantly pushed to put country above party. But I think it will more likely happen if we’re successful in taking back the house. That’s where investigations could come. Now, in the best of all worlds, if they would set up not a non-partisan, bi-partisan outside committee like we did for 9/11, and put people of unimpeachable integrity, both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, but people who were willing to go where the facts led them, that would be ideal. I don’t see that happening right now. The only point I would make is if the Republican leadership begins to believe that Trump is a big political burden to them, then they will begin to be more open to a more thorough investigation. Mossberg: So what do you think the odds are that McConnell, not Ryan, but McConnell, will come to that conclusion? It all depends upon the numbers. Mossberg: You know this guy. Yeah, I do. And it all depends upon the numbers. I think that the Senate intelligence committee is working very well together from everything that I can see. You’ve got the Republican chairman, Senator Berg, working with the Democratic vice chairman, Senator Warner. They are pursuing a lot of leads. So I think both ... I mean, the House Committee is trying. I have to commend Adam Schiff, if any of you are in his district he’s doing an amazing job [applause]. He’s just so thorough and he’s so clear. So there are... there’s some movement. Now with the special prosecutor being appointed, and I served with him, when I was Secretary of State he was still at the FBI. He’s a man of great integrity. That will affect the pace of the investigation, it will affect what happened probably in the Congress, but it will move inexorably forward, because they will not be rebuffed the way that the Congress has been up until now. Nilay Patel: Hi, Nilay Patel, the Verge. I’m from Wisconsin. Why didn’t you spend more time in Wisconsin? Well, I will tell you. We thought we were doing really well in Wisconsin. I spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania, a lot of time in Florida. We sent a lot of great surrogates including Tim Kaine and others to Wisconsin. We watched up until the very end how Russ Feingold was winning. And you know, you make these scheduling decisions based on the best information that you have, and it turned out that our information was not as reliable as I wished it had been. Patel: Did you see that before, or is that in hindsight? That’s in hindsight, yeah. The other thing that’s in hindsight which is really troubling is — since you’re from Wisconsin you may find this particularly interesting — the AP did a really well-researched piece about voter suppression in Wisconsin. And they literally found people who showed up to vote and were turned away, because Wisconsin under the current governor, Scott Walker, has been one of the leaders in voter suppression, making it difficult. So the 85-year-old woman who doesn’t have a photo ID because she doesn’t drive anymore shows up with her medicare card and her utility bills and they turn her away. Or the African American. Or the veteran, also African American, who moves from Illinois to Wisconsin, registers to vote, gets on the rolls, but he still has his Illinois driver’s license, shows up, they turn him away. The best estimate is that 200,000 people in Wisconsin were either denied or chilled in their efforts to vote. I don’t think we believed at the time before the election that it would be anything like that, anything as big as that. So, I will also say that I referenced earlier, there were all these Google searches going on about WikiLeaks, and they were particularly prevalent, very high incidents, in certain counties in Wisconsin. So you had counties that had voted for Obama and were not particularly keen about voting for Trump but worried that I was going to jail, worried that I was running a child trafficking operation in the basement of a pizzeria, the kind of things that were in WikiLeaks [laughter]. You laugh, people were obsessing over this stuff. Obsessing over it. And you put yourself in the position of a low-information voter, and all of a sudden your Facebook feed, your Twitter account is saying, “Oh my gosh, Hillary Clinton is running a child trafficking operation in Washington with John Podesta.” Well, you don’t believe it, but this has been such an unbelievable election, you kind of go, “Oh maybe I better look into that.” Swisher: Yeah, and you are a lizard. Yeah, and well, whatever I am, I’m everything. And so you being to get sucked into it. So some people stayed home, some people voted for Trump, some people stayed with me, and some people went third party, because they wanted to vote, they thought it was their duty, but they didn’t like Trump and now they thought I was as bad as they were being told. So it was a confluence of all kinds of things. Samantha Miller: My name is Samantha Miller, I’m known for founding one of the first cannabis labs in the U.S. And what I wanted to say to you is that I’m inspired by you as a leader, not as a woman. Mm, thank you, thank you very much [applause]. Miller: And one of the questions I often get asked as an executive, what is some advice you can give to young women who want to attain success? I always say to them, the one thing that I point to for young women is if you can shed the need for external validation, because that’s the thing that often keeps you out of the board room, that’s a huge step to your success. So I would really appreciate what your advice to women is who are trying to achieve those heights of success. Well I would echo what you said. It is absolutely the case. You have to be better prepared than anybody. You have to know your stuff as well as you possibly can. You have to be brave because there’s going to be a lot of setbacks and push-backs and all the things that go with it. And you have to be aware of what, up until now, has been a pretty predictable pattern. You know, Sheryl Sandberg writes about this in “Lean In” and the research is convincing. So, as a man gets more successful, regardless of his personality, he gets more likeable. As a woman gets more successful, regardless of her personality, she gets less likeable. It is just inverse. And you have to ... Eleanor Roosevelt said, “If you’re going to be a woman in the public arena, you have to grow skin as thick as the hyde of a rhinoceros.” And you really do have to be prepared. And it’s not just in politics, it’s in business, it’s in, you know, the tech world, it’s everywhere. And it’s not easy. I mean, it’s really, really hard. And I just tell young women to develop more confidence in themselves. You know, I’ve hired lots of young people over the course of my long career, the private sector and the public sector, not-for-profit sector, and the conversation usually goes like this. You say to a young man, “I want to give you more responsibility, I want to give you a promotion, I want to pay you more.” And he goes, “Wow, great! I’m ready! Send me in!” Sometimes he says, “What took you so long?” in getting to that point. But for a young woman, it’s like, “You think I’m good enough? You really do? You think I can do it?” Well I wouldn’t be asking you if I didn’t. But there is still, even for upwardly mobile, successful young women, those doubts, that sense of insecurity. And then when you’re bombarded with expectations about how you’re supposed to look and how you’re supposed to act and what you’re supposed to say and all the rest of it, it can become very disorienting. So, I guess the final thing I would say is, it really is important both for men and women, for mothers and fathers, for employers of both genders, to be really ready to support young women, and to give them that confidence, that external confidence, but to do everything you can to help them weather all of the push-backs and knockdowns that are going to come their way. [applause] Mossberg: All right, we only have time for one more question, and it goes back over here. Swisher: So make it good. Mossberg: Yeah, make it good. Pete Pachal: All right, no pressure. Pete Pachal from Mashable. Looking at Twitter specifically, you spoke a little bit about Facebook, but on Twitter, if you weigh all its good qualities of bringing realtime information to pretty much everyone, and its bad qualities of basically rewarding sass over substance, and generally not having a lot of nuance, do you think it has been bad or good for our national discourse in the United States? Wow. Haha. Hmm. I think it has certainly provided, as you say, positive information, quick turn-around information, to a very large audience. But I think it has become victimized by deliberate efforts to shape the conversation, and push it towards conspiracies, lies, false information. And I think it’s the same problem that Facebook faces, that when you try to be all things to all people and you try to open up your platform so that people can come in, and you want to be influential because you expect people will actually tune you in and read and watch what you have, what do you do to try and contain the weaponization and manipulation of that information? I don’t think we know yet. And I have a lot of sympathy at this point. Kara doesn’t, but I do [KS laughs] for people trying to make these decisions. I would just urge them to hurry up. Because even if you err slightly more on the curating editorial decision-making, so some voices are going to be cut off, some fake news outlets, the guys in Macedonia are going to be denied entry into your platform, I’d rather see us erring on that side for a while to see what the effects are, instead of being kind of overwhelmed by the challenge, like, “What do you do?” I mean, how do you try and determine who should or shouldn’t be on your site? And so I think it’s a mixed bag. Let me just pose this question: Who is behind driving up Trump’s Twitter followers by the millions? We know they’re bots. Why? I assume there’s a reason for everything. Is it to make him look more popular than he is? Is it to try to influence others on Twitter about what the messaging is so that people get caught up in it and lose sight of what they’re trying to say? Mossberg: Well, it puts the Tweets on more feeds. More people’s feeds see the Tweets. Yeah, that’s my point. You’ve got millions of people ... the bots are coming in, you’ve got these repetitive arguments, you’re driving up his numbers. But what is it you’re trying to achieve? What is the message behind this? So you’re sitting in Moscow or Macedonia or the White House, wherever you are [laughter], and you’re saying, you know ... [WM laughs] Mossberg: Just three random places. That trip may not have worked out so well, you know, there’s no blowback. Mossberg: Really, pushing the guy. .. Pushing the guy, failing to reaffirm our commitment to NATO, all of that. And how do we recover from that? Well, we begin to divert people again. I mean, you can’t let Trump and his allies be a diversion. They are a threat. And they have been effective up until now. So Twitter is a perfect example. You’re going to drive up the numbers. You’ve got more people chasing rabbits down rabbit holes, you’ve got all kinds of stuff happening. Why? To divert attention. It’s like covfefe, trending, world wide. Maybe for a minute you’ll forget the latest accusations about them conspiring with Russia, or their trillion dollar mathematical mistake in their budget, or depriving 23 million people of health care. You know, it’s the circus. Right? It’s what a classic authoritarian does. It’s not just about influencing your institutions, your values. They want to influence your reality. And that to me is what we’re up against. And we can’t let that go unanswered, whether it’s on Twitter, Facebook, or anywhere else [applause]. Swisher: Let’s end on that. That’s brilliant. Everybody, Hillary Clinton [applause]. recode_divider In this Storystream Watch Hillary Clinton at our Code Conference A running list of Code Conference speakers who are not running for political office Full transcript: Hillary Clinton at Code 2017 Hillary Clinton says Republicans might probe Trump if the party risks losing in 2018 View all 8 stories More From Recode A running list of Code Conference speakers who are not running for political office Laurene Powell Jobs and Senator Kamala Harris are worried about Trump and immigration Walt Mossberg, Bill Gates and the late-night Taco Bell run that never happened Clinton and Trump are once again locked in a Twitter war Why CBS and Viacom didn’t merge, according to Shari Redstone Shari Redstone, who controls CBS, thinks the NFL is on too many networks Trending Mary Meeker’s 2017 internet trends report: All the slides, plus analysis The most anticipated slide deck of the year is here.

To celebrate the ICC Champions Trophy, a shorter form of cricket than the five-day spectacle the sport is often savaged for, Google has done everyone a solid by adding a new time-waster to their front page. It's basically Stick Cricket meets Google, with two cute crickets taking the place of the batters, and snails representing the fielding team. To play, just head to the Google front page: From there, either press the play icon with your mouse or finger. (Alternatively, you can get there via this link.) You'll then be presented with the cutest pitch: From there it's a matter of just timing your swing as soon as the ball is nearby. The longer you play, the faster the game gets - and the greater the variations, too. You don't need to worry about running between the wickets, run rates or most of the actual machinations of cricket: just see ball, hit ball. It's a pretty decent way to kill a Thursday (or Friday) afternoon. That said, it's not perfect. I can think of one change Google could make: Image: Kotaku There, much better.

Funsters port WannaCrypt to Commodore, Cisco, Nintendo and Tesla Data Center Cloud Google cloud switches on Intel's Skylake Xeons and cloud CPU picker Another thing cloud's changed: it used to be be server-makers that trumpeted CPU exclusives 1 Jun 2017 at 04:02, Simon Sharwood A member of Intel's new “Xeon Scalable Family” has appeared in Google's cloud. The Alphabet subsidiary says that Skylake Xeons are now generally available and that it is “the first and only public cloud to deliver Intel’s next-generation Xeon server processor”. That's the kind of thing server-makers used to trumpet in the hope those with a need for speed would shop with a perhaps-unfamiliar supplier to get their hands on more clock cycles. The arrangement with Google looks similar: The Register understands that Intel cut a custom Xeon for the Alphabet subsidiary to use in the knowledge it would shout long and loud about the new Xeon's many fine qualities. Google's not, however, sharing a lot. It is saying that Skylake-Xeon-powered instances have clock speed of 2.0 GHz and let you build virtual machines with up to 64 vCPUS and 455 GB of RAM. We still don't know exactly what's inside Skylake Xeons, which is no surprise given that Intel's only revealed branding for the CPUs and plans to reveal specifics about their their innards in coming days ahead of their mainstream launch. For now we have Google's assurance that the CPUs are well-suited to demanding applications, but that they're nonetheless ready to roll inside its standard instances, as well as the gruntier highmem, highcpu, Custom Machine Types and Preemptible VMs. For now they're only offered in Google's Western US, Western Europe and Eastern Asia Pacific regions, but the company says “we have more capacity arriving every day, and support for additional regions and zones coming in the near future.” Google's also added a new “Minimum CPU Platform” feature that lets you specify the worst CPU you're willing to use in its cloud. The company has admitted it has a fleet mixing Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell silicon. The new feature means if you specify Haswell, you'll never run on the older Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment MORE Google Intel Cloud Skylake Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Supermicro sockets it to Skylake rivals Comment Word to your motherboard 7 Comments Supermicro boasts of secret super server Silicon Valley win 30,000+ into a single 'valley data centre - but whose is it? 9 Comments SuperMicro, IBM hook up Adding POWER servers yo its Xeon Ultra line Fancy a wee quasi-DRAM?

The opening match will start at 3:30pm on Thursday (Bangladesh time). On the eve of the curtain raiser of the second most popular mega cricket event, leading internet search engine ‘Google’ has changed its Doodle (the logo on the Google) on home page to share the sprite with cricket fans. Including the final and the two semi-finals, a total of 15 matches will be held at three venues -- Kennington Oval in London, Edgbaston in Birmingham and Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. The tournament opening venue will also host the eight-nation meet final on June 18. The record clearly shows that the English team is favourite one as they secured 15 victories over Bangladesh against four losses in their last 19 ODI meetings, but the Tigers must look forward to make an immediate impact against its favourite opponent in the recent history of ICC’s 50-over mega events. Bangladesh emerged victorious in both its recent outings against England in the ICC Cricket World Cup, handing the English side a two-run defeat in the 2011 edition and knocking them out by a 15-run win from the group stage of the 2015 event to qualify for the knockouts for the first time. The recent mega event history can be back as Mashrafe Bin Mortaza has had a solid and balanced team to bank it on by his experienced and youthful enthusiasm associates having the undisputed skills. Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah Riyad and Mashrafe Bin Mortaza bring a decade of experience along with the young Soumya Sarkar, Mustafizur Rahman, Mehedi Hasan, Mosaddek Hossain and Taskin Ahmed. To counter, England have an out-and-out aggressive batting line-up that can sometimes be as deep as to number 11. Eoin Morgan and Joe Root are the experienced hands in a team that has topped the 400-run mark twice in the last two years; 300-plus totals have become England's ODI staple. England have Ben Stokes who is rapidly developing into a one of the best all-rounder in the world, an ode to the England approach of picking genuine all-rounders over bits-and-pieces cricketers. Uncertainty persists as to the condition of Ben Stokes' knee but he - along with Chris Woakes, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid - will be the key to England's chances of success in the Champions Trophy. England are favourites among many experts ahead of the competition, which includes Bangladesh captain Mashrafe and Indian captain Virat Kohli. Every team is wary of a home team that has a squad full of blockbuster cricketers, but taking Bangladesh lightly could be proved very costly. Bangladesh will be competing in the tournament for the first time since 2006, after failing to qualify for the previous two editions in 2009 and 2013 because of its low ranking. Bangladesh’s first experience of the event came in the second edition, in Nairobi in 2000, but the team returned home empty-handed in terms of results. The story remained the same in the 2002 and 2004 editions before they recorded first victory, against Zimbabwe in 2006. That game also remains its last Champions Trophy fixture till date. The Tigers have played a total of eight matches in the ICC Champions Trophy and secured only victory in 2006 edition over Zimbabwe. Bangladesh have never gone past the group stages in the tournament, but when the Asian giant-killer will step foot at the Kennington Oval, they must look forward to make an immediate impact against its favourite opponent in the recent history of ICC’s 50-over mega events. In the remaining matches, Bangladesh will face Australia and New Zealand on June 5 and 9 respectively. England hosted the event earlier in 2004 and 2013 and in both editions they finished runners-up losing to West Indies and India by two wickets and by five runs respectively. India and Australia are the sides to have won the tournament twice. Meanwhile, West Indies, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and South Africa each have annexed the trophy once.

X Collusion put floor under bids for carpeting contracts Long road to first bid-rigging conviction ends with suspended sentence and ‘modest’ fines about 3 hours ago Mark Paul, Mark Hilliard Firmer director of Aston Carpets and Flooring Brendan Smith was fined €7,500 and given a three-month suspended prison sentence. Photograph: Collins Courts         The path to the State’s first bid-rigging conviction took five years to complete. The long journey for prosecutors ended with just a suspended prison sentence and what the judge conceded were “modest fines”. In early 2012, a whistleblower contacted what was then the Competition Authority, now known as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). The whistleblower said tender price collusion was widespread among major players in the commercial flooring sector and claimed that bids for massive projects for multinational investors such as Google, MasterCard and PayPal were fixed. Crucially, the CCPC was provided with email evidence. This included an October 2011 message sent by David Radburn of Dublin company Carpet Centre Contracts (CCC) to Brendan Smith, a director of Aston Carpets and Flooring (ACF). The email mentioned pricing for Google’s Montevetro building in Dublin. Armed with this email and the whistleblower’s statements, competition officials made their move on April 30th, 2013. With gardaí, they simultaneously raided four locations: CCC’s premises and Radburn’s home, the Dublin base of ACF, and the Mayo headquarters of Crean Mosaics, which owns ACF. Smith showed up at ACF during the raid, and was overheard by officers making a phone call urging someone to get rid of their computer and “delete the emails”. It later transpired the call was made to Radburn. Fourth raid CCPC officials took away multiple files and computers as evidence. After assessing them, two months later officials raided a fourth premises. Six weeks after that, the story of the bid-rigging investigation publicly broke on the front page of The Irish Times. The heat was on. At all times, a CCPC enforcement official carries what is known as the “immunity phone”, which is connected to a hotline associated with its cartel immunity programme. This line is contacted just a few times each year. In November 2013, four months after the raids, it rang. The caller was Radburn, seeking to co-operate with the investigation. In return, he received immunity from prosecution. The following April, Smith was arrested over the allegations of bid rigging. Former company director fined over carpet price-fixing scam Irish firm fined €10,000 following cartel investigation Inside Business podcast A 40-year-old father of three from Dunshaughlin in Co Meath, he had built up ACF during the Celtic Tiger years before selling it in 2007 to Crean Mosaics, owned by prominent Mayo businessman Alan Crean. Smith was kept on as an employee of ACF under Crean’s ownership. But by the time of the CCPC probe he had developed a serious drinking and cocaine problem. He entered rehab after his arrest. In September 2015, more than two years after the raids, Smith and ACF were set to face criminal charges. Crean accepted the book of evidence on behalf of ACF, while Smith was granted bail of €500. Central Criminal Court Unusually for allegations not involving violent crime, the case was sent to the Central Criminal Court, the highest level of criminal jurisdiction, for hearing. Here, the precise details of the bid rigging were to come to light, including the litany of top corporate names that fell foul of the illegal scheme. The formal charges were that ACF and Smith implemented an agreement which indirectly fixed prices of carpets and flooring. It covered a period from January 1st, 2011, until April 30th, 2013, the day of the raids. Both defendants subsequently pleaded guilty. Major companies such as Google, Dell and MasterCard were all targets of the scheme that aimed to set an artificial bottom for tender bids for major flooring projects, where square-metre costs quickly add up. At a pre-sentencing hearing last month, the court finally heard full details of how the bid rigging was implemented. Smith first contacted Radburn in early 2011 by telephone, suggesting they meet. The pair subsequently met about “eight or 10 times at a coffee shop near the Westbury Hotel” in Dublin, the court was told. The pair would essentially decide who should file the more “competitive” quote for a specific job and the other would then offer a higher price. While other companies could, and often did, compete for the same contracts, ACF and CCC were two of the biggest players in the market. By colluding on price, they effectively carved up the major contracts between them. In one such case, detailed in court, Radburn won a €193,000 contract to provide flooring for Google. Having tendered for the contract in October 2011 he sent an email to Smith with the details so that he could, in turn, file a higher price. This was the crucial email that helped to convince the CCPC to launch the raids. In some cases, one of the men would agree to simply add an additional euro or two to the square-metre price. In total, prosecution lawyers estimated that eight of 16 contacts investigated by the CCPC ranged in value from €17,000 to €300,000 with an average of €137,000. However, lawyers for ACF said the contracts it ultimately won had a total gross value of €556,000 but a gross margin of €118,000 and an operating profit of just €31,000. Amended legislation Because the allegations related to a period between 2011 and 2013 when relevant legislation was amended, the charges were brought under the Competition Act 2000 and the amended Competition Act of 2012. Anyone convicted under the 2002 law could potentially face up to five years in prison and a possible fine of up to €4 million or 10 per cent of turnover. The 2012 act increased the penalties to as much as €5 million and 10 years in prison. Michael O’Higgins SC, representing Smith, said his client had received only an “indirect benefit” from the bid rigging. “In lean times he kept his job.” Smith (40), who had trained in quantity surveying, went on to build up the value of ACF’s business to €8 million before selling it to Crean in 2007. He remained on at ACF, where he was paid a salary of €130,000 as well as €20,000 in expenses and €20,000 in pension contributions. The court heard he has since faced up to his cocaine and alcohol problem and found alternative employment. The sentencing judge, Justice Patrick McCarthy, imposed a fine of €10,000 on ACF and €7,500 on Smith, which he said were “modest”. He further sentenced Smith to a three-month suspended prison sentence for impeding the investigation with his phone call to Radburn to delete the emails. Isolde Goggin, chair of the CCPC, said cartels “pose significant damage to the economy”. “Bid rigging, in particular, distorts the competitive tender process, potentially excluding legitimate competitors. The victims of bid rigging are customers – in the private sector, hard-working, legitimate businesses, and in public procurement, where the customer is the State, it is the taxpayer who suffers.”       Topics: Brendan Smith David Radburn Isolde Goggin Patrick Mccarthy Competition And Consumer Protection Commission Competition Authority Garda Síochána Carpet Centre Contracts Dell Computer Google MasterCard  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services AIB plans to deal quickly with €8.6bn bad loans problem Technology Female wartime ‘computers’ would be aghast at pay gap Crime & Law Gun murder in Dublin reignites Kinahan-Hutch feud Golf 1:35 Police dashcam footage shows Tiger Woods struggling to walk Sponsored The Story of Home: a potter’s life Life through a lens: Samsung S8 brings photography to next level The Story of Home: A Kerry mountain retreat Truth serum: how serums won a place in our beauty regimes Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

But what is Essential Products? How is it different from any number of other startups and smartphone makers out in the wild? The company website describes itself as, “An entirely new type of company, creating solutions for the way people live in the 21st century.” This is Rubin’s belief and the driving principle behind the company, or so he says. What is Essential Products? In a blog post, Rubin explains that he got the idea while discussing the increasingly fragmented ecosystems that are flooding our world. As he put it, he was tired of looking at an “increasing sea of products that didn’t work with one another…” As with Steve Jobs, Rubin decided that he wanted to build an ecosystem that he would want to use. He wanted an ecosystem that was simple, clutter-free, something that just worked. The idea was not only to shun closed ecosystems — Rubin called them divisive and outdated — but also to ensure that the company’s products remained up-to-date regardless. Google’s vision for Android is very similar to Rubin’s. If Google I/O 2017 is any indication, Google intends for all your smart devices to work on its platforms. The search giant, however, appears to have little to no control over how Android devices are updated. By contrast, Apple’s devices are usually up-to-date and there is no fragmentation. On the other hand, Apple has a death grip on its ecosystem and doesn’t play well with outsiders. Recode’s Walt Mossberg put this question to Rubin at the Code conference currently running in California. Mossberg pointed out that fragmentation was pervasive in Android and that only 30 percent of Android devices actually ran the latest software. Rubin didn’t have a direct answer to that, only saying, “I think we have a solution for that. I think we have a better plan,” reports Recode. Image Credit: Essential From what we’ve seen, it does seem like Essential Products’ approach to devices will follow a mix of Apple’s and Google’s methods. It looks like the company will build finely crafted products, as Apple does, but on a platform that’s open. Since the products are controlled, fragmentation shouldn’t be an issue. Since the ecosystem is open, adaptability and flexibility will be inherent to the model. Essential will take on Apple, but not directly Wired’s David Pierce, who interviewed Rubin, states that Rubin “wants to make Essential the first great gadget maker since Apple.” Rubin’s Essential Phone bears that out. We’ve explained the device in more detail here, but the takeaway is that this $749 device is meticulously crafted from materials seen in few devices. The frame of the phone is made from Titanium, for instance, a material that, as Wired points out, even Apple failed to tame. Rubin believes that the manufacturers of today suffer from “ecosystem envy” and that each wants to develop its own ecosystem. His point that people don’t actually want to be tied to a particular ecosystem is a very valid one. After all, isn’t it more freeing to pick a device or gadget without worrying about compatibility? Why should you worry about compatibility with your TV or home lighting system, for example? Why can’t you just purchase something because you like it? Essential Home epitomises that philosophy. It might just be the first smart home hub that is compatible with the most popular Home ecosystems around. And that’s the key to Essential Products. The devices are meant to be personal and compatible with everything around you. The fact that these devices are also meant to be finely crafted is almost incidental to the aforementioned goals, but it’s a crucial factor that makes Essential’s devices special. Unique by design In the course of the interview with Wired, Rubin reveals that he does not intend to compete with the likes of Apple in terms of sheer volume. Android’s creator helped democratise the smartphone, but he hates the fact that smartphones have become so generic, uninspired. With Essential Products, his aim wonderful, well-crafted products, but in limited quantities. Image Credit: Essential For instance, the titanium frame of the device isn’t easy to manufacture at scale, which is also likely to be the reason why Apple dropped the idea. With the Essential Phone, scale isn’t a criteria, so the company could afford to make such a product. Rubin also insists that his products won’t go out of date within a year. He says that they will “evolve” with you. Essential Products has some very ambitious goals, some might call them too ambitious. But in principle, these goals aren’t that different from Steve Jobs vision for the iPhone or the Mac, and look where that got him. Is Essential Products truly the next Apple? Only time will tell.

It recently tossed up a little holiday sale on movies and TV shows over on Google Play, including some deals that are over 50% off their regular prices. So if you can't go camping or throw that family barbecue because of rain, at least you and your loved ones can snuggle up inside while you binge watch The Wire. It'll be good for little Johnny's character. Among the better movie collections being offered are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy for $20, the Back to the Future Trilogy for $15, and "The Best of Tarantino" six-movie collection for $30. The latter includes one of my favorite cheesy horror movies, From Dusk Till Dawn. The TV selection has a lot of solid HBO shows — if you don't happen to have HBO Go — as well as the complete X-Files for $50, American Horror Story seasons 1-5 for $60 and the amazing Kung Fu series in its entirety for $30. For more family-oriented deals there are a ton of shows from Nickelodeon, as well as a small number of animated children's film collections. You know what? The outdoors are over-rated. Who would want to spend a weekend outside with their loving family when they could spend days forcing their children to appreciate their favorite childhood movies. Let's face it, in the long run, your kids will thank you. Source: Google Play (1, 2) Tags deal alert google play memorial day movies sale tv subscribe ...

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 1 June 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Tech titans thwart former workers’ autonomous startup dreams Autonomous vehicle engineers who left bigger companies like Google and Tesla to start their own companies have faced legal pressure from their former employers that are trying to gain an advantage in an industry that analysts estimate will be worth US$6.7tril (RM28.66tril) by 2030. — Reuters The biggest players in Silicon Valley’s burgeoning autonomous car industry have a warning for their top engineers: if you quit to set up your own company, tread carefully.  Anthony Levandowski, a pioneering self-driving car engineer, became the highest-profile casualty of this increasingly litigious approach after Uber Technologies Inc fired him in the midst of a contentious legal fight. Alphabet Inc’s autonomous car project, now called Waymo, sued Uber alleging Levandowski stole some of its core technology and took it to the ride-hailing company when it acquired his startup. Levandowski has refused to testify in the case.  “You could consider this as a shot across the bow, of companies saying they’re not going to stand for this stuff,” said Michael Dovorany, a Los Angeles-based consultant at the CarLab. “In the past there really hasn’t been a lot of respect or upholding of non-compete agreements. Now you’re seeing the pendulum swing the other way.”  Once General Motors Co paid US$581mil (RM2.48bil) for Cruise Automation Inc last year, a bevy of engineers recognised they could get a bigger payday if they set up their own companies rather than remain employees of a bigger beast. Tesla Inc and Waymo started to haemorrhage top staff, and the number of autonomous car testing licenses granted in California ballooned from about a dozen companies to 30 inside a year.  Several of those engineers have faced legal pressure from their former employers that are trying to gain an advantage in an industry McKinsey & Co estimates will be worth US$6.7tril (RM28.66tril) by 2030.  Waymo alleges that Levandowski stole key intellectual property when he left to create Otto, the startup that was subsequently acquired by Uber for about US$700mil (RM2.99bil). Meanwhile Tesla settled out of court in April with Sterling Anderson, a former director of its Autopilot program. Anderson formed a company called Aurora Innovation LLC earlier this year with Chris Urmson, the ex-head of Google’s self-driving car program. Tesla had claimed that Anderson breached his contract by starting Aurora and recruiting engineers from the Elon Musk-led company.  The smartphone, computer and tablet markets are “very mature, whereas autonomous cars is brand new,” said Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research. “It’s a real opportunity for these tech companies so that’s why they’re taking it very seriously.”  When online learning company Udacity Inc decided to spin out its autonomous car operations into a standalone business earlier this year, it faced a significant hurdle, according to a person familiar with the process. Founder and president Sebastian Thrun had led the Google X innovation lab before leaving to start Udacity, and navigating his relationship with Google held up the formation of Voyage, as the self-driving car business was subsequently dubbed, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private.  Discussions were drawn out over several months, and Thrun, who initially planned to be Voyage chairman, ultimately assumed no formal role at the company, beyond an equity stake through Udacity, the person said.  “Given my deep involvement with Udacity and my close friendship with the Google team, I felt it would be inappropriate to take any role or equity in Voyage,” Thrun said in an emailed response to Bloomberg News questions about discussions with Google. An Alphabet spokesman couldn’t be reached for comment.  Google filed a complaint in December against Leonid Shamis, a software engineer who left to join startup Drive.ai the previous month. The search giant alleged that he and 10 unidentified defendants had breached the terms of employment agreements not to use Google’s confidential information for other means, according to court filings.  Others have so far succeeded in evading the tech companies’ lawyers. Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, former leaders of self-driving car teams at Uber and Google, secured a US$1bil (RM4.27bil) investment from Ford Motor Co in February for their company Argo AI. The Pittsburgh-based startup aims to build the brains for a self-driving car.  “There really do seem to be a select few people who have made a name for themselves in this space,” said the CarLab’s Dovorany. “Their value is really great.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Apple poised to take on streaming biz as services segment flourishes Four instant cameras for snap ‘n’ share summer fun Rocket Internet prepares for profit from startups by year-end Layoffs rile India’s flagship IT sector 5 ways to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Helping to improve children’s vision Cycling for fun helps us bond, says unity advocate MH128: What happened last night advertisement Latest News Africans never hung up on Nokia's old brick China puts into effect new drone registration rules Parents have no right to dead child's Facebook account As China ushers in new cyber law, misgivings remain Sears says some Kmart customer credit card numbers compromised Most Viewed in Tech Parents have no right to dead child's Facebook account How good are budget notebooks really?

Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well. Popular Searches NSX Ltd NSX = 0.3100 0.0000 0.00% KFC Ltd 3420 ▼ 2,225.00 -5.00 -0.22% Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd YMAIF = 0.4400 0.0000 0.00% The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said.  The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has emphasized Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s $24 billion. A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. Load Error This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product. An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better.

Today marks the start of 2017 ICC Champions Trophy cricket tournament and to get you in the mood, Google has made an interactive cricket game, which is insanely addictive. The game features a match between crickets vs snails, which is a reference made by the tech-giant that the game would work even on a slow network. According to the Google Doodle's team blog post, "Ah, summer: the sound of leather on willow, and the spectacle of cricket ... cricket! As the tournament begins in the Oval cricket ground, something buzzes outside. A team of crickets sans tickets have set up their own wickets for a game of pest cricket! As they face their archrivals, the snails, it's sure to be a match for the centuries. Don't be fooled by their sluggish looks - these fielders can be fast on their feet!" Adding, "To celebrate the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, we're inviting everyone to tap/click and take a swing at our pocket-size game!We know that cricket is loved worldwide, so we wanted to make sure our Doodle works for everyone, including those on slower mobile networks. We kept the file size fly-sized, and the result is our smallest interactive Doodle ever - even snail networks can load it in seconds.Whether you're enjoying the tournament at a snail's pace or bowling faster than the beat of a hummingbird's wings, here's hoping you hit it out of the park this summer!" The first game between England and Bangladesh at the Oval today will get the eighth edition of the tournament under way. It pits the top eight teams in the ICC ODI Cricket Championship rankings, who will be divided into two groups of four to play each other in a round-robin format. The top two teams in each group will go through to the semi-finals followed by the final, also at the Oval, on June 18.

Since leaving Google in October 2014, he has been working tirelessly on launching a smartphone that he claims could shakeup the tech industry. Today, we got our first look at it thanks to The Verge. Behold: This is Andy Rubin's super secret mystery phone project. All Images: Essential The Essential Phone is powered by Android (version 7.1.1), and actually shares a lot in common with other flagships like the Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S8. It uses the same processor as the Galaxy S8 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 835) and features other comparable hardware specs, including 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It also has a slightly bigger battery than both the Pixel and Galaxy S8 (3040 mAh). The Essential Phone also has a nice big 5.71-inch QHD (2560 x 1312) display that makes it at least look more like the Galaxy S8 with its edge-to-edge screen. It also has a front-facing 8-megapixel shooter capable of filming 4K videos. That's about as much as you could possibly ask for from the front of the device. On the backside, the Essential Phone employs dual-rear facing cameras (13MP RGB sensor and 3-megapixel "monochrome" sensor) that will supposedly give the phone the ability to take photos comparable to its chief rivals in the iPhone, Pixel and Galaxy S8. It also won't come with a headphone jack (sorry dongle haters) and will instead rely on a USB Type-C and a dongle for audio output. On paper, the phone is a beast, but since we've only seen official renderings and company photos, it's hard to say whether the phone will actually live up to the hype. The specs sound nice, but we'd be remiss to recommend this phone without giving it a proper trial in our everyday lives. One of the weirder elements of Essential Phone, and one we're really looking forward to testing, is its unique inclusion of two pins on the back of the device that will make it somewhat modular and capable of hooking up to different accessories. To start, the pins are going to be used with a charging dock and 360-degree camera. In the future, the pins could be used to hook up even more ambitious accessories. The Essential Phone can be reserved online in the US starting today for $US700 ($941), and customers can get the 360-degree camera kit for $US50 ($67) extra as part of an introductory pricing. The Essential Phone is specifically targeting US customers and will ship in four different colours: Black Moon, Stellar Grey, Pure White and Ocean Depths. Even if it was available in Australia, we would suggest holding off for now, at least until we can test the device and verify that it's actually worth a stack of hundred dollar bills. Oh, wait! But there's more. Rubin's company is apparently planning to release other products like the Essential Home, a smart speaker device that runs on a platform called Ambient OS that is also developed by Essential. The operating system is built specifically with a home network in mind and is meant to anticipate an owner's every need. For example, one way the device will be more helpful than other smart speakers on the market is that it will automatically notify you to leave early for an important meeting or remind you when anniversary's come up. The screen can be used to display timers, reminders, and even directions to upcoming meetings. The Essential Home will use a large circular display and a speaker, similar to the touchscreen Amazon Echo Show announced a couple of weeks ago. The display can apparently help you play music, search for information, set timers, and do some of the other things that you've come to expect from products such as Google Home and Amazon Echo. The Essential Home will likely learn more skills over time through the Ambient OS API that gives developers access to devices, services, and other information about a person's home network so that they can build more useful apps. For now, Americans can only pre-order the Essential Phone, and there's no word on when the phone will begin shipping or be on sale in other places. There's no indication of when the Essential Home will be on sale, either. We'll certainly be following the phone's rollout closely, but it's safe to say Andy Rubin's super secret phone project is... well... not much different than every other Android flagship phone on the market.

Thankfully work got it for me :D Reply 0 Camm @camm Jun 1, 2017, 4:36pm Would have bought a pixel, but a phone with that pricing should be waterproof. Reply 0 rammo123 @rammo123 Jun 1, 2017, 3:15pm Keen to see where they go with this camera attachment thing but apart from that nothing seems particularly groundbreaking.

You probably wouldn't expect to have to interview yourself. In a recent interview with Business Insider, AOL CEO and former Google exec Tim Armstrong described the unusual interviewing tactic used by Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. "I don't think I've ever told this story," Armstrong says. "But when I had my first discussion with them, they basically said at the beginning of the meeting, after a few questions, 'We're not really sure what to ask you. Ask yourself the questions. "'Like, what questions would you ask yourself, if you were us?'" In other words, Page and Brin asked Armstrong to interview himself in front of them. "So I said, 'Look, I'm a very direct person, very honest. Here's what I would ask, the following questions,'" he recalls. "I thought that was interesting," Armstrong says about the unorthodox interview. Over the next decade, Armstrong became an important player in Google's exponential growth, including spearheading the company's AdSense division. After holding multiple C-level positions, he left the company in 2009 to lead AOL. Armstrong wasn't the only one the Google co-founders used this tactic on. "I realized later, after working with them, that that was not an anomaly," he said. "That was one of their tactics." Google has long held a reputation for its difficult interviews. In the past, candidates had to wrangle with brainteaser questions such as, "How many times a day does a clock's hands overlap?" and, "Estimate how many gas stations there are in Manhattan." Hiring managers have since moved on to asking behavioral questions such as, "Describe a time when you solved a difficult problem," which they've found to be better predictors of on-the-job success. But while Google job applicants are less likely to have to figure out impossible scenarios on the spot, they might want to take a few minutes to mentally prepare for a curveball question, including the interview question you would ask yourself.

"The ultimate power, in my opinion, is love, not AI," a top artificial intelligence (AI) expert and chief scientist of AI/ML (Google Cloud) Fei-Fei Li told Xinhua in a recent exclusive interview. In the Chinese language, the abbreviation of artificial intelligence, or AI, is pronounced the same as the character for "love." From the introduction of a second generation of its TensorFlow Processing Unit (TPU) to TensorFlow Research Cloud, almost all of Google's latest big announcements touched on AI in one way or another. Last year, the technology giant recruited Li, one of the most eminent women working on AI, to lead machine learning research for Google's cloud computing division. "Goal is to democratize AI for everyone!" Li, also director of the AI lab at Stanford University's computer science department and the Stanford Vision Lab, tweeted in January on her first day at Google Cloud. "AI is the driving force of the fourth industrial revolution," Li told Xinhua. She believed that all vertical industries have the potential to benefit from AI deployments. "From health care, transportation, retail and consuming, financial service, media and entertainment, manufacturing, agriculture, government, energy and oil ... all will benefit from AI," she said. "AI can make life better: it can help doctors diagnose, deliver health care to remote areas, improve the environment, discover new materials, make energy more efficient ... I hope AI is a more welcoming field to people with diverse backgrounds," Li said. What is the key to democratizing AI? Does it mean lowering the barriers? Li answered, "to reach as many people as possible." "When you say lowering the barriers, it depends on who are you lowering them for. Of course that is part of it, but the end goal is to reach as many people as possible by using those AI-driven technologies," Li said. "For example, if you are a consumer, how do we use AI products to help you have a better experience? You might not know if it is AI, or which algorithm is behind this, but it doesn't matter. We know how we should deliver it to you, so that is the end goal," she said. "On the way to the end goal, lowering the barriers is very, very important, because when you do that, you can get more developers, more companies and more people to participate in the process of designing products, interfaces and business ... But the end is to reach as many people as possible," she said. While opinions differ among AI experts, Li believed that humanity as a whole has the responsibility to use AI technologies to benefit mankind. With more tools and technologies being developed, "we see how they could be used to benefit people or be used in pretty bad ways and cause big problems," Li said. "It's not only responsibilities for developers or discoverers. I think all these people should be engaged: Silicon Valley leaders, professors, students, policymakers, lawmakers, educators ... everybody should be at the table discussing this." Meanwhile, Li agreed that AI currently remains an extremely new and complex field, with resources in the area concentrated in a few leading companies and top universities. 12> Also in the News Showbiz2016/06/16 13:58June 01 2017 15:09:51 Nicole Kidman Recalls Oscar Glory: Loneliest Time Attending Shanghai International Film Festival, Nicole Kidman talks about her role in "Grace of Monaco".

Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well. The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said.  The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has emphasized Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s $24 billion. A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product.

Sign Up An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better.

We've all been there before: the endlessly buffering YouTube/Netflix/Amazon Prime Video stream, the dropped internet connections, the glacial update download speeds and the innumerable “connection not found” errors that plague all home Wi-Fi networks. It's an absolute pain and, for the non-tech savvy amongst us, seemingly impossible to resolve. Thankfully solace may soon be had as Qualcomm's Mesh Networking solution aims to take the headache out of connecting your home network. “Inventing the [home] network that just works,” is how Rahul Patel, Qualcomm's senior vice president and general manager of connectivity, positions Qualcomm's mesh networking platform. “60% of consumers feel they're having issues with their home network,” he explains. “[They find that] either their connection is slow or stops, that there's buffering on video traffic and sometimes completely dropped connections. Despite all of the innovation [in network connectivity], the consumer still remains unhappy.” Mesh networking isn't new. In fact, there's Google Wi-Fi, and Netgear Orbi to name a few. And Qualcomm's tech is in 100% of all current mesh Wi-Fi solutions on the market, what's interesting is what comes next. Video of Qualcomm Mesh Networks: Inventing the Network That Just Works Meshed management The next big advancement over the mesh networking devices already on the market is Qualcomm's commitment to developing systems that can turn your home router and its various nodes into fully-fledged home hubs. With more and more smart devices creeping into people's homes, not only is network congestion an issue that needs to be addressed, but the lack of any sort of standardisation creates problems around the home. “There's a lot of IoT devices coming into the home, all utilising various types of technology,” explains Patel. “Light bulbs and doorbells have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy, but thermostats run on Zigbee and some may use Z-Wave instead. You then have different stacks to navigate with the likes of Apple HomeKit, Google Thread or Samsung's SmartThings. “There [are] even various control inputs to consider with voice controls like Amazon's Alexa or Ok Google. There's a lot of different, complicated, ecosystems being built for the home and no unified way of doing things.” It's understandably a headache to manage all of these devices. As Patel points out, Philip's Hue lightbulbs or Samsung's bulbs both require their own bridges to communicate with your home network – the bulbs can't just handle it directly. What happens when a bulb breaks and a cheaper, more modern, alternative is available from another supplier? Currently that means yet another network bridge to plug into your home, but with Qualcomm's new Mesh Networking technologies your BT Home Hub or Netgear router could handle everything for you. A manufacturer can even roll your favoured virtual assistant into Qualcomm's platform meaning there's no need for a separate Google Home or Amazon Echo. Futureproofing As with any high-value product, you want to ensure what you're buying is going to last you for years to come. With Qualcomm's Mesh Networking solution, the American chip company is preparing to build a home network that's fit for the home of the future. Not only does this new network have to work seamlessly, it also has to handle unprecedented amounts of data and juggle multiple input sources and then get everything talking to one another. “The home network is evolving at a rapid pace,” explains Patel. “The amount of wireless devices coming into your home and the neighbourhood is increasing. The congestion of using multiple devices on the same network has created a big challenge [to manufacturers] to ensure great consumer experiences.” To do this, Qualcomm is positioning its new 802.11ax-enabled IPQ8074 and QCA66290 chips as the perfect solution. Capable of carrying up to four times more capacity than the previous generation of chips, along with four times more throughput, Qualcomm hopes it can form the backbone of future home networks to enable the ease of data transfer around a home network. “I can't say which of our customers will launch [their 802.11ax-enabled devices] first, but I anticipate they'll arrive later this year,” Patel explained when he was pressed for a general timeline for the technology. On average, Qualcomm believes a single user churns through around 70GB of data a month via content streaming, social media checking, file uploading, etc. By 2020, it expects the average user to be consuming over twice as much as that, racking up an insane 165GB of data per month. Things get even more unwieldy when you look at the family unit, which Qualcomm estimates at using around 400GB of data per month already. “My prediction is that, by 2020, an average family of four will consume around 1TB of data per month. That's a lot of data!”   “This is where the challenge lies, you're going to be using your home wireless network a lot more than you use it today, across a lot more devices. Somehow you've got to be able to source and manage all of that data.” Still, even without the higher capacity of an 802.11ax-enabled network, Qualcomm's mesh networking technology is already capable of solving that terrible Wi-Fi connectivity issue plaguing your home network. “If you look at enterprise-level [wireless] networks today, you're connected in one place and, as you walk around, the connection is automatically and seamlessly handed off [to another wireless access point].” The same can also be said with mobile networks, you never actually hunt out another mobile phone mast to connect to, it just happens automatically. Qualcomm's Mesh Networking technology is just trying to make your home network work as effortlessly too.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Report: Apple’s screen-less Siri Speaker is now in production and could debut at WWDC Oscar Raymundo 1 June, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News By the end of the year, Apple will have a Siri Speaker to compete against Amazon Echo and Google Home. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple has started overseas production of its Siri-enabled smart speaker. Apple could unveil this highly-anticipated Siri Speaker onstage during the WWDC keynote taking place on Monday 5 June, but the all-new device won’t be ready to ship until later this year. The Siri Speaker has been designed to compete against the Amazon Echo and Google Home. To differentiate itself from those other products, the Apple smart speaker will boast virtual surround sound and will be seamlessly integrated with Apple products and services, like Apple Music. In addition, the Siri Speaker will give Apple users a new hub for controlling HomeKit-enabled devices around their home. Bloomberg also revealed that Apple won’t integrate a screen in its first iteration of the Siri Speaker. Earlier this month, Apple’s senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller said that he wasn’t a fan of Amazon Echo or Google Home because they lacked screens. Days later, Amazon introduced Echo Show, a version of its flagship smart speaker with a touchscreen. The Siri Speaker is being produced by Inventec, the Taipei-based manufacturer already responsible for making the wireless AirPods. According to Bloomberg, the Siri Speaker has been in development for a long time, reaching the advanced prototype stage late last year. For several months now, Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their own homes. Why this matters: Apple is banking on a smart speaker with superior sound quality and deeper ties to the Apple ecosystem. Those two features seem certain, given the Beats ownership and the new W1 chip that can pair devices seamlessly. In addition, the Siri Speaker could include sensors to measure indoor acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels. But will that be enough to make the Siri Speaker a must-have? Amazon is already ahead in bringing third-party apps to its Alexa-powered Echo devices, even Apple services like iCloud calendar are being brought to the fold. Meanwhile, Google has recently made its AI assistant available on iOS, pointing out some serious Siri fails. And HomeKit devices can already be operated using an iPhone, iPad or Apple TV.

"We're increasingly competing with West Coast global businesses that want to get in the video business," he told a gathering of tech execs. John Shinal | @johnshinal 6 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jeffrey 'Jeff' Bewkes, chairman and chief executive officer of Time Warner Inc. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said Wednesday that existing U.S. regulations covering internet content unfairly favor Facebook and Google and that his company agreed to be acquired by AT&T to better compete with those technology giants. "You have the FCC putting regulations on cable and telco companies, you have the FTC putting regulations on Facebook that are much more lax. I'd like to see it be even," Bewkes said in response to a question about so-called Net Neutrality rules during an onstage interview at the Code Conference in Ranch Palos Verdes, California. Time Warner last year agreed to be acquired by AT&T for $85 billion in a deal that will provide the wireless giant with a stable of news and entertainment content while giving Time Warner new ways of distributing its shows. AT&T will also get valuable data on its end users, which Bewkes says it needs to better compete for advertising dollars amid stiffer competition from the tech industry. "We're increasingly competing with West Coast global businesses that want to get in the video business," Bewkes told the gathering of tech executives. Google's YouTube unit now hosts one billion hours of video viewing per day, CEO Sundar Pichai told Wall Street analysts in April, during a conference call to discuss the first-quarter earnings of its parent company, Alphabet. Facebook is also making a bigger push into video and is reportedly getting ready to roll out its own original shows sometime in June. Those two Silicon Valley giants accounted for 85 percent of the growth in digital advertising spending last year, according to an annual report on the Internet presented at the conference earlier Wednesday from Mary Meeker, a partner with venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. To garner a bigger chunk of that growth, Time Warner needs better data on those who watch its networks, including CNN, HBO, Showtime and Comedy Central. "We're trying to get more data, to compete more effectively with a much bigger set of data that the digital companies have," Bewkes said. The mega-merger, which Bewkes said is "good for America," is expected to close this year after FCC Chair Ajit Pai said in February the agency doesn't expect to review it. Cable and telecom companies, including AT&T, have in the past argued against the net neutrality rules enacted two years ago under former FCC chair Tom Wheeler, saying that they unfairly favor firms that use lots of network traffic. Those rules prevent internet service providers from favoring or discriminating against network traffic from any particular provider, such as Google, Facebook or Netflix. Industry watchers widely expect those rules to be undone by the FCC, which now has a Republican majority. Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox Media.

Since exiting beta in the summer of 2009, Gmail has become a household name and a popular choice among both startups and mid-sized companies. Andy Wen, Senior Product Manager with the Counter Abuse Technology group at Google, announced on Wednesday a handful new security features including early phishing detection using machine learning, unintended external reply warnings, click-time warnings for malicious links and built-in defenses against new threats. Wen said Google’s use of machine learning has helped the search giant block spam and phishing messages from appearing in your inbox with over 99.9 percent accuracy. Considering that as many as 70 percent of messages coming into Gmail are spam, that’s a pretty significant figure. Google’s detection models combine a variety of techniques that have allowed them to generate new URL click-time warnings for phishing and malware links. What’s more, as new patterns are identified, Google’s models can adapt faster than manual systems ever could. Unintended external reply warnings, meanwhile, are designed to help companies prevent data loss by informing users when they attempt to respond to someone outside of the company domain. Thanks to Gmail’s contextual intelligence, it’ll know if a recipient is an existing contact and avoid unnecessarily showing a warning all the time. While Google is framing the improvements as an enterprise-focused update, in actuality, the security updates are a welcomed addition for all users.

In Ohio's case, we seem to have the most trouble spelling "beautiful." America's most misspelled words data was gathered by Google by mining the top searched "How to spell ___" analytics from each state in 2017. In most cases, like Ohio, folks searched most often for help spelling words with between six and 10 letters. But two states, West Virginia and Connecticut, sought out help with a 20-letter problem. Before you go thinking those states are extra smart, that word was the Mary Poppins' favorite: "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." It turns out the citizens of New York, California, Kentucky and Minnesota also don't know how to spell "beautiful." What that says about all of us is unclear. But at least we're not Rhode Island, who apparently doesn't know how to spell the word "liar." And "college"? Come on, South Dakota. Learn more about America's terrible spelling habits right here.

Until now, the online Google Store was not available on the island, but that changes today. Google has updated the Google Store country picker to include Puerto Rico. In addition, the support document listing product availability by country has been updated with mentions of the island. Currently, only the Google Pixel, Daydream View, Samsung Chromebook Plus, and various accessories are available for purchase. Still, at least Puerto Rico residents can now buy an unlocked Pixel straight from Google. You can view the island's Google Store at the source link below.

I ordered my Nexus 4 and a Pixel C from google store. And I obviously live in Puerto Rico. Frisi Just put United States in the billing address and you're good to go. ;) Christian Camacho My account always had access to Google Devices and I live in PR. I've been ordering from the Google Store since the Nexus 4. I'm confused. Frisi This is for those who put Puerto Rico as country instead of United States. I always put my address to United States as country, since we're part of the US. If I put Puerto Rico it even locks me out of the Play Store (except for apps and games). Frisi It has always worked. Since we're part of the United States, we could put US as country and have access to Google's entire hardware catalogue. I have ordered the Pixel, Nexus 5X, Chromecast, Chromebooks, cases, etc. Same applies with Google Play itself. If you put US as country, Movies, Music, and Books works. If you put just Puerto Rico as country then you're locked out from the aforementioned services. MJ Great, now that Puerto Rico has access to the Play store next thing you know they will want to be US citizens. Frisi We *are* US citizens... MJ Shhhhh... Most people in the US don't know that. Tom Westrick They already are US citizens MJ I guess should have ended my comment with /joke.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States Jun 01, 2:34 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Samsung Gear VR Gets Chromecast Broadcast Support By Eric Chiu @eric_chiu On 05/31/17 AT 8:53 PM Close Virtual reality headsets tend to be harder to scale for group settings since the person with the headset is the only one who can see what's going on inside. But soon, Samsung Gear VR owners will be able to share what they're viewing with others. In a post Wednesday, Oculus confirmed Gear VR will be getting Chromecast support. Users will simply need a device with Chromecast support and the Oculus mobile app. By enabling casting through the app, you'll be able to mirror what's on your headset onto a TV or display. The functionality especially can come in handy if you want to showcase a game or app to friends or family and have a TV nearby. Read: Google Unveils New Standalone Virtual Reality Headsets At I/O 2017 Previously, Google previewed the functionality at its Google I/O developers conference earlier this year. The feature is slated to launch on its own Daydream platform and standalone headsets later this year though Oculus slightly beat Google to the punch. Chromecast isn't expected to come to Oculus Rift headsets, but the higher-end devices easily can be mirrored on a desktop display. The update is also one of several social-friendly features that have come to Gear VR. Earlier this year, Gear VR got support for Facebook live streaming of VR sessions where Facebook friends could watch and comment on games or apps being used in VR. The headset previously received support for voice search and has gotten voice search functionality. The updates come as mobile VR headsets from a variety of manufacturers look to bolster their features in coming months. While budget headsets like the Daydream VR and Gear VR have been able to survive with entry-level features and price points, companies have increasingly looked to push the envelope technologically with their successor headsets. Read: Virtual Reality Park The Void Offers Unique Take On VR Experience Google’s standalone Daydream VR headsets, which the company teased at I/O, are one way Google hopes to do so. The new headsets, which are expected to launch later this year, will be entirely standalone and won’t need to be paired to a smartphone or desktop computer. With situational tracking, the new headsets will also be able to track your location in three dimensions without needing external trackers to be mounted to a wall. Google has invested heavily in VR developers and studios, including Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality and Job Simulator creator Owlchemy Labs.  Likewise, Microsoft also has teased headsets with similar functionality. These headsets, which will be coming from manufacturers like Dell, Acer and Asus, will have a relatively mid-range price point and feature situational tracking for higher degrees of interactivity.

What I do love about Apple is its support for third-party keyboards. You can ditch the generic offering and download enough keyboards for every conceivable customisation option you want. Image credit: John Moore/Getty Keep in mind you don't have to commit. Don't be afraid to install more than one keyboard! If I'm looking for some particular animated image I'll use GIPHY Keys more than Gboard, but during normal texting hours or when typing in a note-taking app like Bear, swipe-friendly keyboards are my tool of choice. Gboard (Android, iOS) Google's keyboard (available for iOS and Android) is packed with just enough features to be useful but not too many to be cumbersome or unwieldy. It's been my keyboard of choice since its debut, thanks to its simple search integration: In true Google fashion, you can search from the keyboard itself and send links as well as descriptive cards to recipients. Its responsive swipe functionality is great for popping in and out, while other keyboards I've tried in the past were somewhat sluggish in acknowledging my swiping as spelling. You can pull images and GIFs from Gboard to send or save (though the results sometimes differ between its desktop and Gboard searches). Sure, you can type on it like a traditional keyboard, but Gboard also features glide typing — swiping your finger across letters to spell words — just like Swype and Swiftkey, and it learns from your history to improve its predictive search and text suggestion without transmitting personal data to the company. If you're on a bigger phone, the combination of glide typing and a one-handed typing setting on Gboard is a godsend, and makes texting easier and less stressful on your weak human form. Like talking to your phone? Gboard supports text dictation just like Apple's keyboard. Gboard for Android packs in a few more extra features than its iOS counterpart, including language auto-detection complete with autocorrect and suggested text, as well as live translation. Word Flow (iOS) Unfortunately Word Flow is not yet in the Australian store, but we figured it still deserved a shout out for its unique design. Made by a team in Microsoft's experimental Garage division, Word Flow's easy one-handed use lets me knock some text off even while straphanging. Its standout feature is its curved keyboard mode: The keyboard sits in the corner of your screen and makes it easy for your thumb to reach every letter. You can even glide type while it's curved, and see its suggested text (though the curvature reduces the selection choice list). The built-in web search powered by Bing lets you copy and paste images and GIFs, too. If you're suffering from thumb trouble during your typing sessions or just want to be able to reach your keys without two hands, then this is definitely a keyboard to test. 60 Keyboard Shortcuts For Popular Office Apps (Infographic) Of course, you may not need all 60 of these, but knowing them will make you flexible, fast, and ready to work with whatever tool you're presented with, whether it's a Windows PC, a Mac, an Excel spreadsheet, or a Powerpoint slideshow. Plus, there are extras in here for Gmail and Chrome to boot. Read more Swiftkey (Android, iOS) With SwiftKey, Microsoft now has two different keyboards in Apple's app store. Swiftkey just got a much-needed redesign and with it a more minimal, functional look. It's also more responsive than before, registering swipes quickly enough. It supports swipe typing like Gboard and Word Flow, and custom themes in case you want to add colours to your keycaps. Hooking Swiftkey up to your Facebook or Google account gives it access to your data (it's encrypted before leaving your device, and Swiftkey doesn't have your login information) that it uses to personalise your autocorrect functionality as well as predictive text suggestions. It will even show you how it's adjusting your typing style and how much time you're saving by not tapping away at letters. It also has a few tricks up its sleeve if you're looking to expand your language options — a recent update boosted support to over 100 languages. GIPHY Keys (iOS) I like GIFs. You like GIFs. We all like GIFs. Why not use a GIF-friendly keyboard? In terms of typing, you won't find anything revolutionary here. You'll be tapping away just like before. Giphy Keys isn't as full-featured as Gboard, nor does it feature glide typing functionality like Swype. It's cute, though — and it blows the competition out of the water in terms of GIF search functionality. Giphy is the gold standard of GIF integration across the web, especially since it lets you access the Betaworks company's repository of both pop culture and original GIF content through its slew of categories — or you can search them yourself from the keyboard. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments frankly_franky @frankly_franky Jun 1, 2017, 10:41am SwiftKey hands-down. Predictions are awesome, you can bash away and it knows what you're trying to type even if it's way off. Language support is so good - I have English, Spanish and Portuguese and it predicts all 3 when I start to type the word without the need to change language. On another note - what the hell is straphanging? Word Flow's easy one-handed use lets me knock some text off even while straphanging. Reply 0 dknigs @dknigs Jun 1, 2017, 11:27am Bus / tram / train hanging off the strap. The one handed mode is a bit too small for a non plus sized iPhone though, and it only has US English. In general though I find it works far smoother than swiftkey. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

That means, if you own a Gear VR, you will be able to use Chromecast to stream (or "cast") your virtual reality experience to your TV so that your friends or whoever else is nearby can join in on the fun by being able to see what you're doing inside the VR world. Such options have been available for tethered headsets like the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR but not phone-based mobile VR headsets. Tethered headsets are already indirectly connected to a monitor or TV and essentially mirror the headset display, for instance. But Oculus said that Samsung's Gear VR will be the first headset to officially support Chromecast - or at least the first one you can use right now. Remember, Google plans to add Chromecast support to a Daydream VR update, but that's not due until sometime later this year. Here's everything you need to know about Chromecast support for the Gear VR, including how to set it up. Samsung Gear VR Consumer Edition review Land's End review: Glimpsing the future of VR gaming HTC Vive preview: An experience that's out of this world What is Chromecast? Chromecast is a Google platform you can use to send things from your VR headset to your TV, which must either have built-in Chromecast technology or be hooked up to a Chromecast dongle. The Chromecast platform also lets you send anything from a supported app, such as a YouTube video on your phone, to a TV. Or, you can send a desktop website on your computer to your TV. And that's just three possibilities. Either way, all you have to do is hit the Cast button on your mobile device, then sit back, and watch your stuff appear instantly on your TV. For more information on Chromecast, including how the Chromecast dongle works and how to set up Chromecast to work with a range of devices, check out Pocket-lint's in-depth guides here and here. What is Samsung Gear VR? The Gear VR is a mobile VR headset developed by Samsung, in collaboration with Facebook-owned Oculus, and manufactured by Samsung. It requires a compatible Samsung device, such as the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+, which acts as the headset's display and processor. It therefore works differently from the Rift, a more powerful, full-fledged, Oculus-made headset that's tethered to a PC. To access VR content and apps on the Gear VR, you need to use the Oculus app on your Samsung device. From using head movements for games to watching Netflix in a virtual mansion, there's plenty to experience. See our favourite experiences here. How do you Chromecast with Gear VR? Set up You need a Gear VR headset, a compatible Samsung phone, the Oculus app installed on that phone, and a modern, flat-screen TV that either has built-in support for Chromecast or is hooked up to a Chromecast dongle. If you have all that, you’ll be able to share your Gear VR experiences directly from the headset by streaming to your TV. Your friends can therefore experience it in real time too. Casting Once you have the latest version of the Oculus mobile app running on your Android (which also needs to be up to date), just hit the Cast button in the app, and then select your nearby Cast-enabled TV. You'll then be able to "step inside Gear VR while your friends sit back and enjoy the ride", according to Oculus, which also thinks Chromecast support is a "great way to introduce new people to VR".

Android Pay used to be in such a predicament, but not anymore. Today Google has finally decided to officially launch the service in Canada, following months of rumors and leaks anticipating the move. The latest of those leaks came less than 24 hours ago, in fact. You can use Android Pay at hundreds of thousands of shops across the country, including Tim Hortons, Loblaws, Petro-Canada, McDonalds, Indigo, Pizza Pizza, Sears Canada, Telus, Rogers, and Freedom Mobile. For online purchases Android Pay works with such apps as Lululemon, Uber, Ritual, and HotelTonight - among many others. As you'd expect, you can also store your gift and loyalty cards inside the Android Pay app for easy retrieval when needed. You'll need an eligible Visa or MasterCard credit card issued by BMO Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Banque Nationale, Scotiabank, Desjardins, Presidents Choice Financial, ATB Financial, or Canadian Tire Financial Services, or a prepaid card from Scotiabank or Desjardins. Interac debit cards will be supported starting on Monday, while if you own an American Express or Tangerine card you'll have to wait until "later this summer". Obviously you can add multiple cards into Android Pay, and select which one to use before you make any payment.

In a map released on the Google Trends Twitter page, the company shared the top word each state asks it to spell. Unfortunately spell check doesn’t work on graphics and the map actually contained a misspelling. Ninety. Apparently people in Washington DC can’t spell it and neither can Google. I would have thought their most googled word would have been zero. Sadly, in Wisconsin the most commonly asked “how to spell” word is Wisconsin. It is super tricky with a word that is spelled just how it sounds. Two states wanted to know how to spell the nonsense word “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious”, which at least has lots of letters.   And potassium levels must be low in New Mexico because they don’t know how to spell Banana. I’m not worried about the American education system at all.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology Apple said to ready Siri speaker in bid to rival Google, Amazon Paul Sakuma / Associated Press Apple executive Phil Schiller introduces Siri during an announcement at Apple headquarters in 2011. Apple executive Phil Schiller introduces Siri during an announcement at Apple headquarters in 2011. (Paul Sakuma / Associated Press) Mark Gurman and Alex WebbBloomberg Apple Inc. is already in your pocket, on your desk and underneath your television. Soon, a device embossed with "Designed by Apple in California" may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well. The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said. The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.'s Echo and Alphabet Inc.'s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple's product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren't yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple's HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple's network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google's and Amazon's connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don't support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. "This will be a platform for developing Apple's services," says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has emphasized Apple's services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year's $24 billion. A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple's "Other Products" category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn't respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. This year's developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn't refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product's development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room's acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple's HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple's launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon's gained a touchscreen. Apple's speaker won't include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product. An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better. Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Apple Inc. Amazon.com Inc.

By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article SAN FRANCISCO – Nest Labs is adding Google’s facial recognition technology to a high-resolution home-security camera, offering a glimpse of a future in which increasingly intelligent, internet-connected computers can see and understand what’s going on in people’s homes. The Nest Cam IQ, unveiled Wednesday, will be Nest’s first device to draw upon the same human-like skills that Google has been programming into its computers – for instance, to identify people in images via its widely used photo app. Facebook deploys similar technology to automatically recognize and recommend tags of people in photos posted on its social network. The Nest Cam IQ high-resolution security camera will feature Google's facial recognition technology. Privacy issues "definitely could become a slippery slope," warns Jennifer Lynch, an attorney specializing in biometrics for a digital advocacy group. Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → THE COST OF FACIAL RECOGNITION The new camera will set you back almost $300, and you’ll also have to pay $10 a month for a plan that includes facial recognition technology. The same plan will also include other features, such as alerts generated by particular sounds – barking dogs, say – that occur out of the camera’s visual range. The camera will only identify people you select through Nest’s app for iPhones and Android devices. For instance, you could program the device to recognize a child, friend or neighbor, after which it will send you a notifications about that person being in the home. It won’t try to recognize anyone that an owner hasn’t tagged. Even if a Nest Cam IQ video spies a burglar in a home, law enforcement officials will have to identify the suspect through their own investigation and analysis, according to Nest. PRIVACY CONCERNS Facial recognition is becoming much more common on home-security cameras. Netatmo , for instance, introduced a security camera touting a similar facial recognition system in 2015. That camera sells for $100 less than the Nest Cam IQ. The way that the Nest and Netatmo cameras are being used doesn’t raise serious privacy concerns because they are only verifying familiar faces, not those of complete strangers, said Jennifer Lynch, who specializes in biometrics as a senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital advocacy group. But Lynch believes privacy issues are bound to crop up as the resolution and zoom capabilities of home security cameras improve, and as engineers develop more sophisticated ways of identifying people even when an image is moving or only a part of a face is visible. Storing home-security videos in remote data centers also raises security concerns about the imagery being stolen by computer hackers. “It definitely could become a slippery slope,” Lynch said. The privacy issues already are thorny enough that Nest decided against offering the facial recognition technology in Illinois, where state law forbids the collection and retention of an individual’s biometric information without prior notification and written permission from a person. FURTHER DETAILS Nest’s $10 monthly subscription plans includes video storage for 10 days. Video can be stored for a maximum of 30 days with an upgrade to a subscription plan costing $30 per month. The high-end camera supplements lower-resolution indoor and outdoor cameras that Nest will continue to sell for almost $200. Neither of the lower-end cameras is equipped for facial recognition. Nest can tap into Google’s expertise in artificial intelligence because both companies are owned by the same parent company, Alphabet Inc.

Since being released in October Google’s new smartphones have been very popular, but not perfect. The premium metal and glass design is excellent but it does have some drawbacks. Google’s first phone has a stunning camera, excellent battery life, the latest Android 7.1 Nougat and much more. However, there is no removable battery. Meaning users can’t pull it out when the phone is frozen, unresponsive, or acting funny. Read: 10 Common Google Pixel Problems & How to Fix Them We’ve yet to have a single problem with the Google Pixel or XL that warranted a reboot, but the situation may arise. Everyone uses their phone different, and if your Pixel is slow, draining battery or frozen, you’ll want to know how to do a hard reset. Read on for the quick tip and details. Google’s new phones have a powerful Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a smooth version of Android. They’re among the fastest and best Android smartphones on the planet. However, the occasional problem could surface for owners and something like a quick reboot or “hard reset” may come in handy. We’ve had similar methods for Samsung devices, the iPhone, and even Nexus devices. That said, now that Google’s very own phone is on shelves, owners will need to know all the details. Verizon Wireless explains this step as simulating a battery pull to fix an unresponsive device. Basically all we’re doing here is forcing the phone to reboot, even when it’s frozen and won’t work, to fix any problems. This shouldn’t erase any information or cause any harm. It’s simply a forced hard reboot. Instructions So, for those having problems with a frozen or unresponsive Google Pixel, here’s how to reset it back to working order. The process is similar to many other devices, but actually only requires pushing one button rather than two. According to both Verizon and Google, here’s how to do it. “Press and hold the Power button (located on the right edge) for approximately 10 seconds or until the device power cycles.” Push and hold down Power All owners need to do is push and hold the power button down for about 10 seconds, and the Google Pixel will begin to reboot. Even if it’s completely frozen and not working at all. The phone will power cycle, vibrate, reboot, and be working as good as new once it completes the process. Read: How to Enable the Google Pixel Notification LED This quick step actually fixes almost any minor or even major problems some users may experience on the Pixel, or any phone for that matter. Most issues can be solved by rebooting the device. The difference here is it’s being forced for an unresponsive phone. If you’re experiencing any other problems with the Google Pixel check out our link at the top of the page regarding 10 problems and fixes. Otherwise, head to the Verizon support pages for more information. While you’re here, take a look at some excellent Google Pixel cases in our roundup below. 20 Best Google Pixel Cases Google Clear Case   1 / 20 Getting a case from the phone maker themselves is often the best route to take. Google's clear cases show off the unique design, glass back, or that Really Blue Pixel model.  It looks like a standard cheap TPU case, but Google uses a hard durable polycarbonate plastic. There are precision cutouts for all of the ports, buttons, and sensors.

Roston - May 31, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It was just a few weeks ago that Google was on the receiving end of a fairly big phishing scam, one that targeted Google Docs users with real-looking emails. The scam was only live for a short while before Google squashed it, but the risk remains and anyone can fall victim. Here to help protect its users is Google and its security updates to Gmail. Among other things, the company is utilizing machine learning to help detect phishing attempts and, ultimately, keep users safe. Google has already utilized machine learning to help keep phishing attempts at bay, and the entire process is largely successful: the company says that its machine learning technology helps keep more than 99.9-percent of phishing emails from showing up in your Gmail inbox. The company is now aiming to improve upon that number using a new dedicated machine learning model for early phishing detection. With this, the technology will ‘selectively delay’ any emails to conduct what Google calls a ‘rigorous phishing analysis,’ helping keep Gmail users safe from such scams. This early detection technology will affect less than 0.05-percent of emails on average, says Google. The technology works alongside Google Safe Browsing, another machine learning technology, to identify and then flag any phishing URLs or links suspected of such scams. If you do click on a link that Google finds suspicious, Gmail will offer up a click-time warning, which alerts the user to the potential security risk the link poses. For business users, Google says it is also now showing ‘unintended external reply warnings’ in Gmail, which gives users a warning if Gmail thinks you may not have meant to send that last email. This warning won’t appear if you frequently message the contact, so it shouldn’t be intrusive.

Follow @pinknews News News Home UK US World Trans Politics Education Law Religion Business Entertainment Trans Opinion Travel Life Life Home Health Sport About Advertise Contact Privacy RSS Search Home UK US World Current Affairs Entertainment Opinion Travel Features Trans US Tech giants warn Texas over anti-trans bathroom law Elena Cherubini, PinkNews 31st May 2017, 2:48 PM Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, also signed the letter against the "bathroom bill" (David Ramos/Getty Images) Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and others urged Texas to not adopt a “discriminatory” anti-trans “bathroom bill”. If approved by the Governor, anti-LGBT legislation in Texas would require transgender people to only use public bathrooms corresponding with their sex at birth. The tech companies have lobbied against the proposal and have wrote a letter to Texas Governor Greg Abbot demanding him to stop pursuing the bill. Governor Greg Abbott may to call for a special legislative session to pass the bathroom bill The letter was signed by the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Gearbox Software, Google, Celanese Corporation, Salesforce, Cisco, GSD&M, Silicon Labs, Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HP). The CEOs wrote: “We are writing to express our steadfast opposition to the introduction and passage of any discriminatory legislation in Texas. “Such laws are bad for our employees and bad for business.” Since Texas has a unique political system, the state legislature only meets every two years for a period of maximum 140 days. The state legislature ended this Monday and a partial version of the bill, limited to students in public schools, was passed by lawmakers. However, now that the session has been adjourned there’s talk that the Gvoernor may call for a special legislative session to pass a broader anti-trans bill. Abbott has insisted that passing the bathroom bill was his “top priority”. “As large employers in the state, we are gravely concerned that any such legislation would deeply tarnish Texas’ reputation as open and friendly to businesses and families,” the letter continues. “Discrimination is wrong and it has no place in Texas or anywhere in our country.” The ending of the letter clearly states the opposition of the tech companies for the bill. “We strongly urge you and the Texas legislature not to further pursue legislation of this kind.” North Carolina,the only state in the US that had a “bathroom bill” in place, repealed it earlier this year, but the decision sparked controversy as the partial-repeal left some discriminatory policies in place. Governors in Arkansas, Kentucky, and South Dakota have rejected this type of law. Earlier this month Texas passed a bill that allows adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBT people. The same legislature also passed a bill banning ban transgender athletes from competing. 0 reader comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter More like this What is a gender-neutral bathroom?

Skip to Content RedMonk the developer-focused industry analyst firm Become a client Menu Videos Research Events About Team Services Clients Contact Search @redmonk James Governor's Monkchips So what even is a Service Mesh? Hot take on Istio and Linkerd By jgovernor | May 31, 2017 Share via Twitter Share via Facebook Share via Linkedin Share via Reddit Remember that time, when we used to blithely use Docker and microservices interchangeably? Docker has proved to be excellent in simplifying dev and test workflows, while Kubernetes has emerged as a strong alternative center of gravity for deployment of container-based apps. But it’s still early days in terms of production deployment of container based apps, especially of microservices-based ones apps. What’s a service mesh? It’s the thing that focuses on solving all of those problems. Routing, rerouting for graceful degradation as services fail, secure inter service communications. Abstracting the networking and messaging in microservices based deployments. You never want to be the only person that turns up at a party. If there is only one of something its pretty hard for people to understand as a market category. With that in mind, the launch last week of ist.io is notable because it joins linkerd, another service mesh platform previously accepted by as a project by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. And then there were two. Or three, counting Docker routing mesh. Istio is described as “an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, without requiring any changes in service code. You add Istio support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication between microservices, configured and managed using Istio’s control plane functionality” Backers of the project are shall we say rather notable – IBM, Google and Lyft. At this point, unlike linkerd, istio is only based on production lessons from a single company – Lyft. IBM and Google are coming at the problem from a vendor platform perspective. Istio reflects IBM increasing investments into the Kubernetes ecosystem. By working with Google it is making a statement about regaining some industry engineering leadership. As IBM’s Jason McGee said: “IBM needs an engineering opinion [on building microservices], and we worked with partners that show that.” That said – one interesting tension likely to emerge is that while initially integration between Kubernetes and Istio is very crisp, there plans in future to support serverless, Cloud Foundry and even bare metal deployments. Pivotal certainly expects to see Cloud Foundry support in the near future. Dormain Drewitz’s post on istio is really good, breaking it down into 3 key benefits – security (TLS for service to service authentication, intelligent traffic management (proxy, deployed as a sidecar to the relevant service), and visibility (monitoring and tracing for troubleshooting and debugging) So what about linkerd, which is led by a single vendor, Bouyant, building a classic VC-funded commercial open source business around the technology, based on lessons learned while the founders worked at Twitter. The project’s key design principle is simple – that in a microservices world failures are more often found in the interactions between services. This should not surprise us – it’s pretty much distributed computing 101. But the complexity of the microservices implementations at Web scale natives is staggering enough to require a new generation of dedicated tooling. Microservices is hard – as the originator of the term Martin Fowler makes clear in this post it is not for everybody, because of the overheads created in building and maintaining applications composed of independent services with strong module boundaries. The chart of the Twitter topology above is one of favourite visualisations of the fact. Linkerd is described as “a transparent proxy that adds service discovery, routing, failure handling, and visibility to modern software applications.” “By providing a consistent, uniform layer of instrumentation and control across services, linkerd frees service owners to choose whichever language is most appropriate for their service… Linkerd takes care of the difficult, error-prone parts of cross-service communication—including latency-aware load balancing, connection pooling, TLS, instrumentation, and request-level routing.” So a service mesh is in effect a domain specific router for microservices. It sits above TCP/IP and assumes Level 3 and 4 networking. Not surprisingly, William Morgan does a bang up job of explaining why you need one. Not surprising because Morgan is cofounder of Bouyant, which wants to win paying customers customers building synchronous transaction-based systems with requirements for minimal latency composed of microservices – likely to be fintech and telco initially. Istio seems more agnostic about supporting asynchronous microservices patterns, which could become a point of distinction between the two platforms going forward.  Service discovery and routing are two of the microservices questions that have yet to be comprehensively answered by either Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. In a distributed world services are by definition and design going to fail – so how do you route around them when they do? Linkerd is already used in production at Ticketmaster and the UK challenger bank Monzo (originally called Mondo). At least one other major cloud company is doing some very interesting refactoring around Linkered, but that’s NDA for now. Perhaps ironically the smallest vendor Bouyant seems to have the most service mesh deployments at scale. So we now have a new center of gravity, a couple of interesting new projects to consider when looking at how to build, monitor and manage microservices based apps, alongside open source tools like Prometheus and vendors like Datadog and Weaveworks. Service mesh – it’s a thing now. Docker, Google, IBM, and Pivotal are clients. Weaveworks is in my coworking space. No Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Now that they're larger (and in Google's case, an ISP), protecting a healthy, open internet from anti-competitive gatekeepers apparently isn't quite the priority it used to be. Speaking at a conference this week in California, the CEO stated that while Netflix thinks net neutrality is "incredibly important,” it's "not narrowly important to us because we’re big enough to get the deals we want." You'll recall that large ISPs came under fire a few years ago for intentionally letting their peering points congest in order to kill settlement-free peering, driving up costs for transit and content companies. Those accusations were supported by a recent lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against Charter, which references e-mails from executives acknowledging the tactic. The mere threat of the FCC's net neutrality rules appears to have put an end to the practice (for now), but not before Netflix paid up. And now that interconnection isn't a pressing concern, Netflix is apparently no longer interested in standing up for the consumers and smaller companies that will be impacted by the FCC's decision to kill the rules. Hastings says the company will still technically oppose net neutrality via internet company trade organizations like the Internet Association, for whatever good that does. But as for Netflix taking an active role in trying to keep the internet healthy and open, Hastings appears resigned to give in to the Trump FCC. "I think Trump’s FCC is going to unwind the rules no matter what anybody says,” Hastings said. "We had to carry the water when we were growing up and we were small," Hastings said, "and now other companies need to be on that leading edge," stating also that "where net neutrality is really important is the Netflix of 10 years ago."In short: we've got ours, too bad for everybody else. tags: business · net-neutrality News Jump »Netflix on Net Neutrality: We're Big Now, It's Not Our ProblemCablevision (Optimum) Sued Over Cancellation PoliciesComcast Gigabit Speeds Reach Seattle, San Fran, DenverForum Topic: Is VoIP Reliable Enough for the Elderly?DirecTV Now Now Available on RokuWednesday Morning Links Charter Strike Quietly Enters Third MonthMarsha Blackburn Pushes New Privacy Law She Knows Won't PassMore Users Contemplating Cutting the Cord Than Ever BeforeAltice Unveils New Logo, to Kill Cablevision, Suddenlink Brands----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 18 comments Anonace01 @spcsdns.net Anonace01 Anon Yesterday 8:44 pm forgot This reminds me of a scripture from the bible, and it was If im correct: "do not let me become so rich that I forget about you nor become so poor that I have to beg and steal".

Yet, Google poses new competition with “Android Automotive.” The Linux Foundation’s Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) project announced its first design win for its open source, Yocto Project based Unified Code Base (UCB) distribution for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI). The 2018 Toyota Camry will offer a UCB-based AGL IVI system when it debuts to U.S. customers in late summer. Following the debut, AGL will also “roll out to most Toyota and Lexus vehicles in North America,” said the AGL project, which did not reveal timing. 2018 Toyota Camry with AGL-based IVI view shown at right (click images to enlarge) The Toyota debut is unsurprising considering the Japanese carmaker has long been the project’s biggest booster, but it is no less significant. Toyota represents 14 percent of the U.S. automotive market, and has eclipsed GM as the world’s leading carmaker with an 11 percent global share. AGL’s design win comes at a pivotal moment, as Google recently expanded its Android Auto project for mobile communications with IVI systems to advance to a comprehensive Android Automotive IVI project (see farther below). Over the last two years, AGL has gradually eclipsed the GENIVI Alliance as the main driver of Linux-based IVI, and the project plans to move into ADAS and self-driving car technology in the future. Recent membership wins for the 100-member plus project include Suzuki and Daimler AG (Mercedes-Benz). Other automotive manufacturer members include Ford, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan, and Subaru, and most of the major Tier 1 system integrators are onboard as well. Joining AGL doesn’t necessarily mean these companies will release cars with UCB-compliant systems, but additional deployments are likely for next year’s 2019 automotive launches. Two UCB 3.0 interface screens from AGL’s CES 2017 demo “The flexibility of the AGL platform allows us to quickly roll-out Toyota’s infotainment system across our vehicle line-up, providing customers with greater connectivity and new functionalities at a pace that is more consistent with consumer technology,” stated Keiji Yamamoto, EVP, Connected Company of Toyota Motor Corp. “Adopting an open source development approach has enabled us to focus resources on developing innovative new features and bringing them to market faster.”   Android Automotive At Google I/O earlier this month, Alphabet-owned Google announced the long-rumored expansion of its Android Auto project into a full-fledged IVI stack. The new Android Automotive stack will first appear on Audi and Volvo cars. Audi hasn’t committed to a timeline, but Volvo says its first Android Automotive Volvo model should hit the road within two years. At Google I/O, Google demonstrated a Volvo V90 and an Audi Q8 running an Android Automotive prototype. Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code has been shipping in various IVI systems for years in selected car models from Mitsubishi, Renault, McClaren, Hyundai, Honda, and others. Google’s has not been involved in these diverse projects, each of which has its own spin on Android. Many car manufacturers have, however, adopted Google’s CarPlay-like Android Auto standard for easing the sync between Android mobile devices and compliant IVI systems. Mitsubishi’s Android-based triple-display FlexConnect.IVI system (click image to enlarge) As ArsTechnica’s Ron Amadeo points out in a May 19 Google I/O report, most of these earlier stacks have run out-of-date Android versions. By contrast, Google aims to push out fresh, Android 7.0 Nougat releases to early customers like Audi and Volvo. Google will provide a safety-minded Android Automotive UI template, which carmakers can then build upon with their own branding. Google then layers its famously popular apps, including Google Maps, on top of that. AGL has a similar concept, enabling car manufacturers and Tier 1s to differentiate the UI. The AGL platform is a few years ahead of Android Automotive, which already has the advantage of a built-in app ecosystem. The Android Automotive stack currently has no Google Play integration, although it’s presumably coming. Android Automotive is based on Android Auto, with most of the new features expanding to HVAC and radio controls, says ArsTechnica. The story praises one innovative feature called “garage mode” in which the car wakes up after hours to download updates. As a result, the IVI boot won’t be slowed by app updates when you start the car in the morning. Android Automotive architecture (click image to enlarge) Android Automotive has a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that keeps the interface consistent despite the physical transport layer. System integraters can “implement a vehicle HAL module by connecting function-specific platform HAL interfaces (e.g. HVAC) with technology-specific network interfaces (e.g. CAN bus),” says Google. They can also integrate a dedicated MCU running a proprietary RTOS for CAN bus access within the Android Automotive framework, which can communicate with it via a serial link. The base level of Android Automotive is a Vehicle HAL, which is controlled by a VehicleNetworkService layer that adds security features. Above this sits a Car Service stack, which is called by a higher-level CAR API that interacts with the top application layer. AGL and Google have a long road ahead before they can compete with the IVI heavyweights: Blackberry’s industry leading QNX and Microsoft’s Windows Embedded Automotive. Microsoft took a hit when Ford left it for QNX, but it recently signed up Renault-Nissan. Many other cards offer homegrown proprietary systems or experiments based on Android or open source GENIVI Alliance code. Many of these same companies are experimenting internally with AGL. Apple’s long-awaited expansion of CarPlay into an IVI system has apparently stalled. Apple appears to be moving away from introducing an “Apple Car,” and is instead planning on developing technology it can sell to makers of self-driving cars. Alphabet has its own Waymo self-driving technology company that so far appears to be independent of the Android Automotive effort. Earlier Google self-driving car prototypes have run Ubuntu.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Search just made art education much more interactive Newsby David Imel8 hours ago 79 4 Google Search is an amazingly spectacular thing. Google Arts and Culture is also amazingly spectacular. Wouldn’t it be great if they worked together in a fun and educational way? Now, they do. Announced on Google’s own blog, “The Keyword”, searching and learning about art has just become a lot more interactive through the tech giant. While you could already search about specific pieces and get a pretty good understanding of them, the Google Search team has teamed up with Google Arts and Culture to make the experience even better.   Read moreXiaomi Mi 6 review Now, when you search for an artist, you can get an overview of their life, see a panel of high resolution photos of their works, and even see where their art is currently on display. If you can’t travel there yourself, you can always jump into Google street view and do a virtual museum tour to experience the pieces up close and personal. While you’re walking through, quick information about each piece will pop out, and you can click on the art you’re interested to take a closer look. To do this, Google scanned over 15,000 unique pieces all over the world at participating museums, and used machine learning to index them, similar to how Google photos lets you search for people, places, or things. The whole process was nearly automated, and that’s pretty darn cool. If you want to try it out, just search for your favorite artist and check out some pieces. There’s bound to be a plethora of works for you to zoom in and explore, and you might even learn something new about them while you’re at it.

Thursday, 1st June 2017 Twitter Facebook RSS Home Top Stories Local Africa International Business Opinion & Analysis Crime & Courts Entertainment Sport Advertise Is your IT security top priority? The process of buying online Google to launch job seekers service June 1, 2017 Clearance Munondo International Sundar Pichai Google is developing a new service called Google for Jobs that’s designed to help people across the US find their next job. But the offering might take down some established job boards in the process. Google for Jobs is a search service that uses machine learning to deliver more relevant results. The service initially will take job postings from partner sites such as Monster.com, Facebook or CareerBuilder. It will automatically match a person’s location to help them quickly discover available positions. Google for Jobs also will have some handy filters to narrow search results. But there are still many question marks surrounding Google for Jobs and its unclear how traditional job boards might hold up to this big, new competitive challenge. This eWEEK slide examines Google for Jobs and the impact it might have when it launches. Google for Jobs is not another app. Rather, Google for Jobs functions as a full-fledged search feature that helps users find available jobs in specific locations. It will be accessible in the browser on both the desktop and mobile devices. To get Google for Jobs off the ground, the search giant plans to partner with LinkedIn, Facebook, Monster.com, CareerBuilder and Glassdoor. Those sites will feed Google for Jobs its content, making Google for Jobs a repository for job listings across a wide array of services instead of just one. Machine learning plays a critical role in Google for Jobs. The service’s artificial intelligence will categorise and cluster jobs around the user’s skills. Rather than searching for content and displaying several results that aren’t relevant, Google for Jobs ensures the most relevant results are delivered to job seekers. An automatic location feature can be adjusted Many job boards force users to search around a particular location, which means they might miss positions in nearby areas. Google for Jobs will automatically determine a person’s location and populate results with positions in the area. And if users want to search outside their location, they can do that, too. Google for Jobs will launch with a host of filters that aim at improving search results to make them more relevant. The filters are especially useful in certain industries, such as retail, where the breadth of jobs is wide. For instance, users can filter their search criteria to look for retail management jobs rather than store clerk positions. The filters also can be used for salary requirements and other information. At least at its onset, Google for Jobs won’t require employers to change how they post positions: They can simply go to the job board of their choice and post a job. The listing will find its way to Google for Jobs automatically. While Google hasn’t confirmed its plans, the company noted during its announcement that job seekers might be able to apply for positions through Google for Jobs. The application would be quick and easy, Google indicated, and could allow job seekers to apply to several positions in less time. At its Google I/O developers conference, the search giant justified launching Google for Jobs by pointing to problems with the current hiring market. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai noted 46 percent of US employers “face talent shortages and have issues filling open job positions.” Google for Jobs was designed specifically to alleviate that problem and quickly connect employers and applicants, he said. One of the big questions is whether Google for Jobs could derail current job boards. Google currently is partnering with big jobs sites, but its possible users ultimately will choose Google’s service to find positions, since it will have content from several sources. Google said it’s not in competition with job boards, but it could throttle some of its partners if it proves as popular as its other search services. Google has not specified a launch date for Google for Jobs. However, the company did say it would be available within the next several weeks. Google for Jobs is launching with a handful of partners and could add others in time. Google i/o buzz focuses on new android version, mysterious fuchsia os The buzz circulating in advance of Google I/O indicates that Android, virtual assistants and perhaps the mysterious Fuchsia project will be among the topics the cloud giant discusses at the conference. — eWEEK.

If you've got plans and ideas, here are some great Windows and some cross platform tools to process them with. Read More . The company isn’t killing the Nik Collection, so it will still be available to download and use. However, Google has decided not to develop it any further, putting the future of the Nik Collection in doubt. The Nik Collection is a set of photo editing plugins for popular photo editing software such as Photoshop, Lightroom, and Aperture. The Nik Collection comprises seven different plugins which offer filters, darkroom-inspired controls, sharpening, and noise reduction, amongst others. When Free Means No Longer Useful Google first acquired the Nik Collection in 2012 alongside Snapseed. At the time Nik Software was charging $500 for the Nik Collection, but Google quickly lowered the price to $150. Then, in 2016, Google lowered the price to $0, making the Nik Collection completely free for everyone. Unfortunately, that switch to free appears to have had a knock-on effect on Google’s commitment to the Nik Collection. Because, as first spotted by PetaPixel, Google is no longer committing any resources to the Nik Collection. So much so it won’t even work on Windows 10. Google has recently added a banner to the top of the Nik Collection saying, “The Nik Collection is free and compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 through 10.10; Windows Vista, 7, 8; and Adobe Photoshop through CC 2015. We have no plans to update the Collection or add new features over time.” The Nik Collection is still available to download and use on Windows and on Mac. However, with Google no longer updating the collection it will become incompatible with newer versions of the operating systems. And unless Google open sources the Nik Collection its future is very much in doubt.

Google is obviously well within its rights to abandon development of the Nik Collection, but that will be of scant comfort to anyone affected by the company’s decision. Do you use the Nik Collection for photo editing? Have you only been using it since Google made it available for free? What do you think of Google’s decision to stop updating the Nik Collection? What do you think will happen now? Please let us know in the comments below!

Oculus, the Facebook-owned virtual reality business, said Wednesday that people can now stream virtual reality video from Gear VR headsets to Google’s Chromecast media player. Now, when people play virtual reality video games or watch VR films, others will be able to watch along with them on televisions. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. The new streaming feature is only available for the Gear VR headset, which requires an Android phone to operate. Samsung makes the Gear VR headset while Oculus supplies the software. Unlike virtual reality headsets like Facebook’s Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive, mobile headsets like the Gear VR or Google’s Daydream View, are relatively inexpensive but are less powerful than PC-powered VR headsets. As a result, visuals are lower quality, among other tradeoffs. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. The new streaming feature follows a similar announcement from Google. The search giant said a few weeks ago during its annual developer conference that Daydream View customers would also be able stream VR media to the Chromecast when the next version of its Android operating system is released later in the year. For more about technology and finance, watch: Samsung shipped roughly 4.5 million Gear VR headsets in the 2016 compared to about 300,000 Daydream View headsets, according to market research firm SuperData.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Everything We Know About the Google Driverless Car The Google Self-Driving Car Project drew lots of attention and interest to driverless cars. Here's where it stands today. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) May 31, 2017 at 6:06PM Google's Self-Driving Car Project has probably done more than anything else to bring the idea of driverless cars into the public conversation -- and to the attention of future-minded investors.  Now known as Waymo, and structured as a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the Project's test vehicles and prototypes are what many people think of when they think of a "self-driving car." But what do we know about Waymo and its driverless-car technology? Here's a summary for investors looking into this space. The Google self-driving effort is now a company called Waymo. its test fleet will soon have several hundred vehicles operating on U.S. roads. Image source: Waymo LLC. Who runs Waymo? Waymo is organized as a subsidiary of Alphabet, and its CEO is John Krafcik. Krafcik, who joined Waymo in December, is an engineer and executive with an extensive background in the auto industry. His resume includes long stints at Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and Hyundai, where he rose to become CEO of the Korean automaker's U.S. operation. He left Hyundai to become president of TrueCar in 2014, a role he held until last year.  It's thought that Alphabet hired Krafcik to run Waymo in part because of Krafcik's history, contacts, and credibility with the traditional automakers -- or put another way, his ability to explore and negotiate partnerships with them.  Veteran auto-industry executive John Krafcik is the CEO of Waymo. Image source: Waymo LLC. What is Waymo's technical goal?  Right now, Waymo is aiming to reach "Level 4," a system that is fully self-driving with no human intervention needed, as long as certain conditions are met. That's different from a "Level 5" system, which can do anything a human driver can do. (Level 5 is almost certainly Waymo's long-term goal. Click to learn more about the different levels of self-driving technology.)  Like other Level 4 systems under development, Waymo's system relies on (among other things) highly detailed maps that help the car's "brain" know exactly where it is at all times. At least when it's first introduced, Waymo's system will probably only work in areas that have been well-mapped.  Is Waymo planning to build its own cars? Krafcik has said that Waymo won't manufacture its own vehicles. That suggests the company might work with one or more of the established automakers on a joint project.  It's already working with at least one major automaker, albeit only on a limited basis for now. Waymo's current test fleet consists of specially modified Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans. Waymo engineers worked closely with counterparts at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) to develop the test vehicles. FCA delivered the first 100 Pacficias to Waymo in December and said in April that it will build another 500 for delivery to Waymo later this year.  Waymo has also had discussions with Honda (NYSE:HMC) about a similar arrangement to create test vehicles, but as of now, no agreement has been announced. The original Google "panda cars" were just for testing, but the cars' shape captured the public's imagination. Image source: Waymo LLC. Will Waymo build any hardware at all? In a presentation in January, Krafcik disclosed that Waymo has developed its own self-driving sensor hardware, including a low-cost LIDAR (laser detection and ranging) unit as well as custom-built cameras and radar units.  Waymo has said that its customized sensors give it better data to improve its software, and as its software improves, it helps to optimize the hardware.  What about those adorable Google "panda" cars? The quirky Google "panda" cars have become the public's idea of what a self-driving car will look like. But the truth is, the Google cars were designed strictly for testing on Google's campus and other areas that are separate from public roads.  The reality is that the first self-driving vehicles to be offered for sale will probably look a lot like ordinary cars (or minivans).  Image source: Waymo LLC. How will Waymo turn its technology into a business?  Here's what Waymo said about its plans in a Medium post discussing its hardware:   Ultimately, this integrated software and hardware platform will let us deliver products and services that make getting around safe and easy for everyone. Some of these we may do on our own. Some we may work on with partners. That's why we've been so intensely focused on getting the technology right, ensuring this can scale, and working with companies like FCA, Honda and others. We are mastering the hardware and software to build a better driver for a fully self-driving car. Pretty vague, right? The truth is, Waymo itself might not yet have a clear go-to-market plan. It appears to be exploring several different possibilities. One route might be for Waymo to provide its hardware and software to automakers; it's known to have had discussions with several, including FCA, Honda, and Ford.  But there are alternatives. Waymo recently announced a partnership with ride-hailing company Lyft. It's not clear where that's going, but another possibility is that Waymo could provide kits for Lyft to retrofit self-driving systems to vehicles bought elsewhere.  Waymo's deal with Lyft has an interesting complication: General Motors (NYSE:GM), which is thought to have fairly advanced self-driving technology of its own, owns 9% of Lyft and has a seat on its board. GM hasn't commented on the Waymo-Lyft deal except to say that it has no problem with it -- but it raises the very interesting possibility of a Waymo-Lyft-GM deal at some point in the future.  What will come of all of this? It seems likely Waymo will find a way to profit handsomely from its technology, but it may take a few years for clear paths to emerge.  In this photo from 2011, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt and company co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are shown in one of the earliest Google self-driving test vehicles, a modified Toyota Prius. Image source: Alphabet. How do we invest in Waymo?  Right now, the only way to invest in Waymo is by investing in Alphabet. There are lots of good arguments for owning Alphabet stock, but (at least right now) Waymo is only a small one; it's hardly a pure play. Some analysts have recently floated the idea of a Waymo IPO. If and when that happens, I expect there will be a lot of interest.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The use of a personal bank account by Pauline Hanson for donations and allegations that there was a lack of transparency of activities in that bank account led the day. The Greens have referred the matter for investigation by the Australia Electoral Commissioner. One Nation says everything was declared in accordance with the rules. The phoney war over whether there is a link between refugees and terrorism continued. Immigration minister Peter Dutton said if anyone has a problem with the immigration program causing terrorism, talk to him. He backed Asio boss against conservative commentators and Tony Abbott. Barnaby Joyce said if you want to link terrorists with refugees, you might as well draw a link between “terrorism and testicles”. It was a fairly forceful pushback against Abbott’s strong criticism of government “pussyfooting” around the alleged link. Question time was fought over tax figures, who taxes more and at what end. Lots of rhetoric, little meaningful headway. As we close for the evening, contemplate a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. It seems like a fait accompli but let’s go to bed with a little hope in the heart. Thanks to the brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. Thanks to Mike Bowers who ends the day with a couple of well aimed images. We will be back here in the week after next, June 13, for the final sitting fortnight ahead of the winter break.

He made a fascinating/depressing point about our growing population. He said the population is projected to grow by another 16 million people over the next 40 years, but among NAB’s customers (according to its research) there is not wholesale support for a larger Australia. For many, the prospect of a higher Australian population means more stress in the ability to buy a house, to live where you want to live, to get to work with a reasonable commute time. And many in the community are also concerned about our ability, as a nation, to maintain norms of Australian social and economic inclusion, and to continue to provide access to high quality services in areas such as healthcare and education. These concerns are playing out against a backdrop of rapid technological advancement that is seeing the digitalisation and automation of many aspects of our lives, including in the workplace – and with it growing concerns about job security. But what about the business perspective? The same NAB research … showed that most of our business customers would strongly prefer a larger population which supports better business growth,” he said. It is time for business and the community to stop talking past one another.

He tells David Speers at Sky – and he has said it before – that there is a small number of extremists in all groups. Joyce said it would be like painting all men as terrorists because a small number commit terrorist acts. It’s like saying they are all blokes. It’s like saying there is a link between testicles and terrorism. Good people in all communities provide information so we can keep Australia safe. With a few exceptions that’s working well for us and let’s keep that program going. On Abbott’s other views around Islam, Joyce says Abbott had the right as a backbencher to have those discussions.

Turnbull says Shorten is practicing the politics of envy. I ask the leader of the opposition this, how do you look to thousands of Australians on middle incomes and say to them in good faith, everything Labor policy does, will discourage you from getting ahead?

With the new feature, you could program the camera to recognize a child, friend or neighbour, after which it will send you notifications about that person being in the home. ___ What's behind the German trade surplus angering Trump? FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) —President Donald Trump keeps criticizing Germany's trade surplus with the United States. Germans say their products are just better and people want to buy them. Here's a look at Germany's trading relationship with the U.S. and the rest of the world. ___ Covered-up chic: Big brands are waking up to modest fashion LONDON (AP) — Big brands are responding to growing demand for "modest fashion." From exclusive designers to fast-fashion chains, retailers are trying to court millions of Muslim consumers, especially around the month of Ramadan, which started last week, when many Muslims buy new clothes and dress up. ___ US stocks slide further as banks and energy companies sink NEW YORK (AP) — US stocks fall as banks weaken after executives say their trading businesses are having a rough quarter. Energy companies skid along with oil prices. Drugmakers and utilities finish higher. ___ Trump expected to leave climate deal — but with 'caveats' WASHINGTON (AP) — A White House official says President Donald Trump is expected to withdraw the United States from a landmark global climate agreement. However, Trump and his aides are looking for "caveats in the language" related to the exit and had not made a final decision. Leaving the deal would fulfil a central campaign pledge but would anger allies who spent years in difficult negotiations to produce an accord to reduce carbon emissions. ___ Analysts: Leaving climate deal likely wouldn't add US jobs WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has declared that abandoning the Paris climate agreement would be a victory for the American economy. But many economists say pulling out of the deal likely wouldn't add jobs. ___ Investors press Exxon on disclosure of climate change impact DALLAS (AP) — Shareholders are pushing Exxon to disclose how climate-change regulations could hurt demand for oil. The oil giant's CEO promises that the board will consider the vote, which came over company objections. Exxon is holding its annual meeting as profit is down and the stock price has been sagging. ___ Some cities, states help minorities enter marijuana industry OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Some states and cities where marijuana is legal are trying to make up for disproportionate effects of drug enforcement on minorities by giving them a better chance at entering the pot industry. In Ohio, for instance, a 2016 medical pot law included setting aside 15 per cent of marijuana-related licenses for minority businesses. The effort's supporters say legalization is enriching white people but not brown and black people who have been arrested for pot crimes at far greater rates than whites. ___ Kellogg shutters distribution centres, lays off workers NEW YORK (AP) — Kellogg is closing distribution centres around the nation, laying off more than 1,000 workers. The company is following through on a prior decision to shift to a warehouse system. It has been cutting costs as sales decline amid changing consumer trends. ___ With season over, CBS' dominance remains a constant NEW YORK (AP) — For all the changes in how television is made and consumed, CBS' success remains a constant. The Nielsen company says CBS is the most popular prime-time network now for the ninth straight year, and 14 of the last 15. ___ Ohio attorney general sues 5 drugmakers over opiate crisis COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The Ohio attorney general is suing five drugmakers for their alleged role perpetrating the state's addictions epidemic. Attorney General Mike DeWine accuses the companies of intentionally misleading patients about the dangers of painkillers and promoting benefits of the drugs not backed by science. DeWine, a Republican expected to run for governor next year, joins other states that have filed similar lawsuits. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, to 2,411.80.

Wednesday’s move by Google’s Waze unit, best known for its navigation and traffic monitoring app, extends the year-old carpooling service outside its initial markets of Northern California and Israel. Waze will now be pairing up drivers and passengers across a wider expanse that includes heavily congested highways in Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California. Latest business videos Waze connects drivers and riders with similar commutes based on their home and work addresses. Riders request carpool rides in advance, but aren’t guaranteed matches. Drivers can only pick up one rider; they also get to review the profiles of potential riders in advance and to select the ones they prefer. Riders can only request two rides a day. The service is primarily focused on rush-hour commutes, when the odds of successfully matching drivers and riders are highest. Waze said tens of thousands of drivers and passengers have registered for carpooling in Northern California. It won’t begin booking carpooling requests outside Northern California until June 6 to give interested drivers and riders a chance to sign up. Move over Morgan Freeman! The Google-owned popular navigation app debuted the new feature on Monday, though it's currently only available on Android and there's no word on when it will be ported to iOS. There are 39 phrases you can record in total, including “Turn right,” “Stop,” or “Let’s go!” Media: Wibbitz Since signing up for Waze’s carpooling service in February, Lesley Watson says she gets paid $3.50 to $5.50 every time she gives someone a ride on her morning commute from her home in Oakland to her job at an advertising agency in San Francisco. Sometimes, she also picks up a passenger on her commute home, although she usually drives solo. “It has helped me offset my commute costs for gas, tolls and parking,” says Watson, 28. It also has given her a chance to make new friends among the five or six people she regularly picks up through the Waze app. Although the expansion could pose a threat to Uber and Lyft, most people who use ride-hailing services don’t rely on them to get to work, according to survey data. Instead, most people use Uber and Lyft for recreational or social reasons, particularly between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., when public transit shuts down in many places. That’s according to a survey of 4,500 people conducted last year by the Shared-Use Mobility Center, a group that focuses on public transit and ways to reduce the number of cars on the road. Only 21 percent of the respondents summoned a raid-hailing service to commute to work, and then did so sporadically, the study found. ALSO Uber fires engineer at center of Waymo trade-secret lawsuit Cost could easily be a factor. For instance, commuting to downtown San Francisco from Lafayette via Uber could cost $30 to $40 each way using the service’s own carpool option, according to Uber’s fare estimator. On Waze, that 22-mile ride would cost no more than $12.42. Unlike ride-hailing services, Waze’s carpooling service isn’t designed to provide drivers with a major source of income. It tries to calculate a price that’s most likely to encourage two people to carpool instead of driving separately. At most, drivers are paid 54 cents per mile — the rate that Internal Revenue Service allows to account for gasoline, insurance and maintenance for a vehicle used on business. “We want the ride to be affordable enough for riders so they use it frequently and we want drivers to be rewarded for taking a detour to fill an extra seat,” said Josh Fried, head of business development for the carpooling service. The service also doesn’t make much money for Google, which derives most of its income from digital advertising. But the company will be amassing data on commuters and their travel habits. That could be useful for a variety of purposes, including targeted advertising and planning potential future transport services, including any involving the self-driving cars one of its spinoffs, Waymo, is now testing. While carpooling has been around for decades, it’s never been particularly popular. “People don’t want to get tied to something that requires them to ride with the same people and be in a certain place at a certain time,” said Sharon Feigon, executive director for the Shared-Use Mobility Center. Using technology to match drivers and passengers on days they want to participate in a carpool offers more flexibility that may get more people to try it out, and discover they like it, Feigon said. But it’s not an easy business. Lyft ended its carpool service nine months ago, citing a shortage of drivers willing to meet the demand. It’s currently experimenting with another commute-hour option called Shuttle that makes designated stops on routes in two test markets — San Francisco and Chicago. The expansion makes it more likely that Waze will offer carpooling in other urban regions, although Fried declined to comment on that possibility. So far, the only other market that Waze has confirmed is Brazil, where the carpooling service will begin operating this year. Michael Liedtke is an Associated Press writer.

Newslook A man takes a selfie while waiting for the start of an Apple event at the Worldwide Developer's Conference on June 13, 2016 in San Francisco, California. (Photo: Andrew Burton/Getty Images) 1633 CONNECTTWEET 13 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE FOSTER CITY, Calif. — We’re in the heart of the tech conference season, in which giant players including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and next, Apple, lay out their visions for where their company futures—as well as the tech industry as a whole—are headed. Looking at what’s been discussed to this point (and speculating on what Apple will announce at its Worldwide Developer Conference Monday), it’s safe to say that all of these organizations are keenly focused on different types of artificial intelligence, or AI. What this means is that each wants to create unique experiences that leverage both new types of computing components and software algorithms to automatically generate useful information about the world around us. In other words, they want to use real-world data in clever ways to enable cool stuff. You may hear scary-sounding terms like convolutional neural networks, machine learning, analytics, and deep learning associated with AI, but fundamentally, the concept behind all of them is to organize large amounts of data into various structures and patterns. From there, work is done to learn from the combined data, and then actions of various types—such as being able to better interpret the importance of new incoming data—can be applied. While some of these computing principles have been around for a long time, what’s fundamentally new about the modern type of AI being pursued by these companies is its extensive use of real-world data generated by sensors—such as still and moving images, audio, location, motion, etc.—and the speed at which the calculations on the data are occurring. When done properly, the net result of these computing efforts is a nearly magical experience where we can have a smarter, more informed view of the world around us. At Google’s recent I/O event, for example, the company debuted its new Lens capability for Google Assistant, which can provide information about the objects and places within your view. In practical terms, Lens allows you to point your smartphone camera at something and have information about the objects in view appear overlaid on the phone screen. Essentially, it’s a form of augmented reality that I expect we will see other major platform vendors provide soon (hint: Apple). Related: Inside Mark Zuckerberg's vision for your Facebook augmented reality Google I/O: Here are the big changes coming to Google Siri vs. Google Assistant on the iPhone: here's who's talking Microsoft to sell mixed-reality headset and controllers for $399, undercutting Oculus Behind the scenes, however, the effort to make something like Lens work involves an enormous amount of technology, including reading the live video input from the camera (a type of sensor, by the way), applying AI-enabled computer vision algorithms to both recognize the objects and their relative location, combining that with location details from the phone’s GPS and/or WiFi signals, looking up relevant information on the objects, and then combining all of that onto the phone’s display. Of course, there are thousands of other examples of potential AI-driven experiences, each of which requires different combinations of computing components and software. In fact, in this new computing era, we’re starting to see a remarkably diverse set of technologies being developed and used to enable these new activities. Here are some of the companies involved. On the chip side, for example, instead of just thinking about CPUs in the devices that are driving these experiences, we’ve seen companies like Nvidia successfully demonstrate how GPUs, which are traditionally only used for doing computer graphics, can be powerful new AI computing tools. Other GPU providers, such as AMD and chip intellectual property-licensing firm ARM have also started to introduce new offerings that are focused on artificial intelligence-based applications. Not all artificial intelligence-based applications are primarily suited for GPUs, however. Companies like Qualcomm are also starting to demonstrate how components like DSPs (digital signal processors) can be very power-efficient tools for doing AI. Not be outdone, chip powerhouse Intel now offers an entire range of different chip architectures, including dedicated AI chips from recently purchased Nervana, to FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) and, yes, CPUs for doing different types of AI work.

And Apple is  working on a Neural Engine chip specifically for doing AI on future generation iPhones and other devices, according to Bloomberg. Ironically, in the midst of all this new technology, one of the other intriguing aspects of AI-driven applications is that they’re pushing our traditional computing devices into the background. Sure, we’re still often using things like smartphones to enable some of these experiences, but the ultimate goal of these advanced AI computing architectures is to make our technology become invisible. Voice-based computing and digital assistants are a step in this direction, but we’ll eventually see (hopefully!) small, discrete head-mounted displays and other new methods of interacting with a computing-enhanced and more contextually aware view of the real-world around us. Though some have voiced concerns about the rapid encroachment of computer-driven artificial intelligence, it’s actually leading us to a very different type of computing future that promises to be less intrusive and more useful than what we’re currently experiencing. And that’s something to be excited about.

The flaw was first discovered by AOL developer Ran Bar-Zik, who found it was possible to activate the microphone and webcam without user prompting and turn the browser into a surveillance tool for an attacker. Read: Alternatives To Google And Gmail: Private Search And Email Services Promise Online Anonymity The vulnerability stems from an issue in WebRTC, a communication framework the Chrome browser supports to allow users to make use of real-time voice and video chats like Google Hangouts. Typically, Chrome prompts the user when a website attempts to activate WebRTC to prevent the site from accessing the tools without permission. Chrome will also show a red dot on a tab when a recording is taking place. Bar-Zik discovered a way to bypass some of Chrome’s attempts to alert users to the browser’s activity thanks to a flaw in the new HTML5 video and audio API (application program interface). The developer created a script that would open a new tab after the user allowed WebRTC on a website. Once the framework is approved, the hidden tab created by the script would persist and record audio and video from the device without the red recording dot appearing on screen. Bar-Zik published proof-of-concept code for the attack and created a website to demonstrate the possibility a hacker could record a user through the browser. The site asks a visitor for permission to use WebRTC, then creates a pop-up that records 20 seconds of audio without giving any indication to the user. Read: Google Removes Chrome Extensions From Web Store Citing Hidden Malware As Reason In a real attack, Bar-Zik warned, an attacker could create a much more discreet method of recording that could capture audio and video for an extended period of time. “It can use very small pop-under and submit the data anywhere and close it when the user is focusing on it. It can use the camera for [a] millisecond to get your picture. It can [in theory] use XSS to ride on legitimate sites and their permissions,” Bar-Zik said. Bar-Zik disclosed the bug to Google on April 10, but the company has yet to take action to fix the vulnerability. The developer said his report was “not classified as a high urgent issue” by the browser developers. “This isn't really a security vulnerability,” one person involved on Chromium, the open source platform behind Chrome, wrote. “For example, WebRTC on a mobile device shows no indicator at all in the browser. The dot is a best-first effort that only works on desktop when we have chrome UI space available. That being said, we are looking at ways to improve this situation.” The bug is not the first time Chrome has been accused of being an accessory of spying. It was previously reported the browser from Google was remotely updated with code that would allow the browser to listen to and record conversations without the user’s permission.

Opinion: Google+ isn’t dead, but it is drowning in spam (though it plans to do something about it) Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 10:20am PDTMay 29, 2017 148 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 63 Share on Twitter Total Shares287 Editorials Google Last month Gideon Rosenblatt did a post on Google+ about the very platform, and it resonated with us here at AP. Many of you may know that we have invested a lot of our time here into Google+. After all, this is Android Police, and Google+ is as much a product of Google as Android is. But, we’ve been disheartened recently by issues with the social network. Most notably, a growing problem with spam. Our own site founder and owner, Artem, spoke out recently about his problems with the platform in the wake of Rosenblatt's post. And his is just one of many posts which have been attracting more attention and discussion on the subject. All of this has even prompted a response from an engineering manager at Google, who says that it is going to make a greater effort to fix things in the future. But spam is just one symptom of the platform's problems. I can't talk about spam without talking about what causes it. Unfortunately, that means I need to beat a bit of a dead horse. A lot of the problems you've heard about the platform in the past are contributing factors. Spam is an indicator of health, and the often-discussed historical problems with Google+ are the diseases. So it might seem that I'm digressing onto a well-worn subject here, but it is important to the discussion. All the old problems From a development perspective, Google has been distancing its social platform from its other tools as much as it can. Photos and Hangouts were once both integral parts of the Google+ experience. But, much as each subsequent update to Google+ has removed or limited features, each year seems to take away integration with another Google service. Hangouts on Air, Google Photos, Shared Circles, location sharing, Google+ Local, with all these things gone it may almost be fair to say that Google+ may have seen more features removed from the service than it has in total at present. Although it was made a part of G Suite last year, it may be a bit too late, and the utility to businesses for the social platform is likely limited. By design or accident, ostracizing Google+ in this way may have resulted in stagnation. Isolation reduces the user count and the number of eyes on content. And that stagnation is a breeding pool for spam. Google’s advocacy for the social platform has also diminished. Many prominent Googlers, as well as people in the core Google+ team, are barely even using the service. If your own employees can’t be motivated to use your product — if not on merit, at least as a means of promoting it — then what sort of attention is being paid to it? Writing here at AP, when I embed social content from Google, it almost always comes from one of two places: Twitter or YouTube. Part of that is because Google posts more things to those platforms than it does to Google+, and that’s a problem. Consider the difference in content volume between the Google Photos Twitter, Google Photos Blog, and Google Photos Google+ account. The last one of those only saw four posts this year. So not only are Googlers not using the platform, Google also recognizes the lack of marketing value for its own self-promotion. And even those few posts made by official Google accounts have had issues with spam. Thankfully in light of the recent attention drawn to the subject, they've been mostly cleaned up. But, if Google's own content has problems with it, imagine what users face. And all the new ones All the other, well-discussed issues have not been enough to prevent Google+ from soldiering on as a niche network. It isn't Facebook (thankfully), or Twitter, but people use it. Adoption may have slowed, and utility might be diminished, but it has a user base. A surprising number of little communities have popped up inside it. Developers with Android apps have been using it as a platform for app communications, beta tests, and technical support. In the realm of Google related software development, the platform is a small but bustling community attached to the larger market. And the people there like it. At least, they like it when the signal to noise ratio remains high enough to drown out the spam. To be fair, one can't claim this is a problem exclusive to Google+. All social media platforms have problems with spam, it’s basically a rule. As the barriers to mass communication become lower on a given platform, the quantity of submitted content that is used for marketing purposes increases. It becomes a delicate balance. How easy can you make account creation before every account is a bot? How easy should comment removal or reporting be so that spam can be caught, but censorship isn’t abused? What sort of burden can be placed on users, and how much responsibility for policing content can be delegated? Given the widespread nature of spam on most high-profile Google+ posts, this particular balance may need some adjustment. Some of the recent changes to Google+ have also increased the proliferation of spam. A lot of the older functionality that made managing content easier was stripped out in the responsive redesign of 2015-2016. Although the new site is more performant and consumes much less data, it also has a lot fewer methods of user interaction with content. Every post view is now a click, and comments must either be scrolled or each post opened in a new window, both of which make reporting content that little bit harder. Increasing the number of barriers for finding and reporting spam makes each post its own little breeding ground. Even in a perfect world, nothing can ever entirely eliminate spam. Everyone has a Grandma selling Avon that doesn’t care how much people might dislike her relentless self-promotion on Facebook, or a cousin who is stuck in a pyramid scheme and blissfully unaware of his predicament. But more steps need to be taken by Google to decrease its presence. Unfortunately, that's much easier for us to say than it is for Google to do. What can be done? As GitHub previously needed a wake-up call for how to better treat things on a social level, Google might also need to reexamine a few things about how it wants to handle Google+ going forward. Just because the platform has become niche doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a future. For fans of Google’s services, developers on its platforms, and news outlets such as ourselves, the service has genuine utility left in it. To that end, Google has responded to the recent criticisms leveled at the service by promising to do things better going forward. And knowing Google, it will find a novel solution to the problem. But can the it be fixed by itself? Across two responses to the recent posts complaining about spam, Google+ engineer manager Leo Deegan stated that it was the number 1 issue to be addressed going forward. He also acknowledged that some of the interface changes in the redesign on Desktop made things more difficult, but changes are planned for the future. Some of their areas of focus going forward will include better spam control, enhanced community moderation, cleaner notifications, and better navigation. It might seem from the outside that change is occurring slowly, but a lot of work has been done updating things behind the scenes. He reaffirmed that Google is committed to the future of G+, as demonstrated by its inclusion as a core G Suite product, and was glad that the community was providing feedback about these concerns. Spam might just be an indicator that a platform is popular enough to be a target, but a number of the tools that could potentially be used to fight it aren't possible as a result of the other problems I mentioned. By ostracizing Google+, all Google does is ensure that the spam stays in a closed box. If more of Google's services made use of the platform, more eyes would be on its content, and more would likely be reported. With more eyes in Google+ the volume of spam might not change, but spam itself would be reported faster and more frequently. And by not using the service — either as individuals or professionally — Google further decreases the number of eyes on content. In reddit parlance: admins are asleep, post spam. But, imagine they never woke up. It's like an abandoned house covered with graffiti. If the landlord doesn't check in, and a lack of business keeps visitors from the area, all the people living in the neighborhood still have to put up with it. Unfortunately for Google, the cost for us to leave is 0. But fortunately for the neighbors, Google has promised to renovate soon. Tags Google Google Plus opinion spam subscribe ...

It was actually quite active for a while, and I hit about 80,000 followers. I followed hundreds of interesting people. Had thousands of great discussions. Then the spam started. We all complained to Google, but it was like talking to ourselves. After a while, I was spending most of my time on the service blocking spam, while all the people I followed gave up and left. I left about 6 months ago, as my feed slowly came to a halt due to the exodus. This is much the same sequence as all the social media sites that have come before. Great for a while, turns to crap, I move on. It was great while it lasted. If you're still finding G+ useful, more power to you. chromaniac The problem started when Google decided that they know what Google+ should be instead of what the users of the platform wanted it to be. I was part of the Google+ Help community and it was painful to see TCs and RSs repeating the same thing again and again every time a feature was killed or detached from the platform. In the last couple of months, there were one or two individual accounts that were posting updates. Most of which were teeny tiny enhancements or bug fixes that no one cared about. It's insane how badly they killed a solid platform with a small but dedicated user base. Of course, for a company the size of Google, a product needs to have a sizable user base which Google+ never attained. Too bad, instead of killing it like Google Reader, they keep on dragging it on and on and on insulting the remaining users/fans. bekifft And don't forget that they killed Google Reader specifically because it was seen as a threat to the growth of Google+. I'm still mad at them for that. bekifft There's no metaphor for Google+ as a baby, Google+ was more of a clone born out of a desperate fear of Facebook, combined with poor management. It was always a solution in search of a problem that only Google had and no one else saw as a problem. The start of Google+ and the reign of Larry Page perfectly coincide with the start of Google losing focus. It's been all downhill from there, from a user focus perspective. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Well stated. Cliff Wade Huge thanks to Ryne Hager for the mention and linking to my post. :) Ryne Hager Woo! Thanks for being cool with me doing it. First (real) op-ed. Cliff Wade @ryne_hager:disqus Any time man. Excellent article, but then again, it's written on AP, so you know it's going to be good! :) In all seriousness, really good article and a lot of good stuff was mentioned and discussed. I am a member of the G+ Early Access community, Google+ Create and Community Vanguards(got invited into the last two because of my post you linked to) and I can say there are quite a few things being worked on. One of which deals with spam but I can't elaborate unfortunately. It's just one small step towards what will be coming in the near future hopefully. Leo Deegan, Carter Gibson, LeAnne Osborne and others are very active on G+ and it's good to see things being discussed, both openly and in private communities about the future and updates to G+. I really feel there are some changes coming soon. Ryne Hager Good to hear! I am confident Google will be able to sort things out for the platform. yanick So many astrologers and this article is only opinion. Why didn't you asked them about G+ future? :-))) Ryne Hager Damn, I could have avoided writing this entirely. Next time.

Nick Coad Wooooosh abc Gee, you're an idiot. Mace Moneta Most of the people I followed on G+ starting leaving about a year ago due to the spam. I finally left about 6 months ago. Amazingly, Twitter was much better, though it obviously doesn't easily support long form content. So now, 18 months after the people I know started to leave, Google has decided to address the problem? Great. IainPurdie Gave up on G+ several months ago when they "updated" it. At that point, any posts I put up on my business page were "Me Only" and there was no way to change it. The page with the option to fix this was inaccessible. G+ became, essentially, useless. Plus, they never opened it up fully to allow third party apps to post to it as Twitter and FB have done, making it too much donkey work to use. Then there's the atrocious app that throws stuff from my feed at me in a worse, more random fashion than facebook. It's impossible to find a post you read two minutes ago. skeleton My girlfriend says she doesn't know how to work it, they need to make it more accessible to the average Joe.

NeilR You can find spam anywhere in the world but at least those fake astrology ads are simple enough to be brushed off as most people as spam. NeilR Just because the author of the article linked a few screenshots of spam posts you assume most of the spam on Google+ comes from middle east and India. Nice. Any other sweeping generalizations you make? abc No.1 in spam!! 'Murica, fuck yeah! Ryne Hager You are right, the images are a bit too repetitive. Just to make it clear we didn't intend to single anyone out, I've changed a few of the images in the editorial. Vikas For me Google+ is just a tool to signup for beta or tech support of any app or product. chromaniac Google removed that requirement long time ago. Google+ Sign-in because Google Sign-in. Hamza Abass grateful permit easy access to my google+ account at any time. Vikas These Astrologer, Lost Lover and Champcash spammers can be found everywhere here in India. Carlos Eugênio Meanwhile many normal posts are being considered spam without the option or possibility to approve them in our communities. Schultzter I still say there's nothing new in Google+ that Google didn't already have in their existing products. Their effort would have been much better improving the products they had, keep them separate but make it easy to move from one to the other from within Google. There's no point trying to build a better Facebook now that everyone is already on Facebook. chromaniac The way Google f'ed it up after departure of Vic is astonishing. I finally deleted my account 2 weeks ago. I only miss following the posts of few folks who I believe only post on Google+. But the user experience had become so painful that it was time to say it goodbye. Unbelievable what Google did with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ It's not like you can just crack the social media market and become relevant at will, regardless of resources at your disposal. I can sort of imagine the reasons why Twitter got so popular, but don't think it would be easy to try to replicate it. YuCMi You're right, it also takes some awareness and a plan. Both of which Google never seemed to have. Stu I still use it but solely to perform the basic functions that Google Spaces did before Google stopped developing for it. aRvInD When many Googlers who write Android code still use iPhone as primary devices clearly says they themselves aren't interested much in their products... Harsh but truth..! Zsolt V Harsh but a lie. aRvInD Lie?? When why iPhone's Google apps often contain some new features before they get pushed to android beta users? Zsolt V Often? It happens very rarely and then it's because different teams work on different platforms. But what the fuck does that have anything to do with Google+? Or do you really think that the choice that person makes has any influence on the release schedule? At least at Google there is a choice. Can you imagine an Apple employee using a non-iPhone or non-Mac? Vantius Google+ in it's early days had a lot of interesting and new ideas to social media. The idea of putting people into groups based on interests and assigning audiences to posts based on those groups was a great idea. The idea of being able share live videos was a good idea too. It forced Facebook to adapt and improve it's own services. But, Google lost sight and IMHO started going downhill on the introduction of collections. it became obvious that they didn't know which way to take it. András Oláh I think Collections was a great idea but terrible implementation especially after the material design update. If it is a pain to manage your own collections and required 5+ clicks to set the collection you want to post to, no wonder no-one will use it. And the Collections landing page is even more terrible, there is zero visual indication whether a followed collection has any new content or not. I stopped following new collections because I felt that there is no point, as I will never see again those post in my stream. I stopped using more than 4 collections because of the inconvenient UI of switching collections. catalysto Sharing to collections is very easy. Sharing a photo to the G+ app, you can choose any collection or group you want right at the top. Metallinatus But.... did the black mage solve your problem? Ryne Hager 'course they did. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/495e00ef0755a130a47e98be9a9c81d1d83b992ccf87a3ab2b590f99a9c25400.gif Urmil Shroff I hope they do something about this, quickly. Peter Garlinski Maybe I'm one of the few, but Google+ works quite well and I've never encountered spam. Maybe it's because I've spent time with getting my circles setup with legitimate, decent people I want to get content from. With Facebook, I find it harder to really cut through the crap to talk to new people. Google+ makes it easier to do that. If Facebook ditched their awful feed concept, I would use it more, but right now Google+ is my go to platform. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ I'll second that never encountering much spam on Google+ part, at least compared to Facebook. I'm admin on a couple of user groups on Facebook and this week I had to ban at least 15 people for posting Malaysian child pornography videos..imagine. I mean I'd take astrology and sexy love any day over that despicable content. Timothy Vreeland I'll third it. I never see spam on G+. Where are the authors seeing it?

YuCMi No, because it's probably spam. YuCMi Google+ doesn't have any quality content in their trending page. At one point I wondered if it could emulate Reddit, but there's no -1 button or a way to block all the cringe teenager oriented communities. If only Google+ let their users decide what they want to see. Instead you have absolute garbage trending.

Just kidding😂 Lord Argyris That black magic specialist stuff seems to be the in thing for spammers these days. I've seen it several other places lately. Robin Hugli I use Google + a lot, not as social media but for all community for apps , beta apps community and all Android roms and development community or all popular tech news website etc , it's really good and quite active. But that's true,if a community for example become less active, like an app community that isn't updated often and the community become a bit dead , it become a spam place , many spam posts as the moderator isn't active. It's quite sad. What I suggested: on telegram, the owner of the chat can add administrators bots , that can detect spam or unsuitable post , automatically delete those posts , ban or warm people. That can be very useful on Google plus. Ryan Its really hard to care at this point. Google+ had some decent ideas around social but it was too late to the game so they "forced" people onto the platform by moving services that shouldn't have been there onto there. I only had G+ for photos and sharing location (when they stripped latitude from Google Maps). And both of those rolled out with LESS functionality as a part of G+ than they did prior. Right or wrong by being forced to use G+ to get them AND the stripped functionality it created a negative association with G+ for me. I was ready for G+ to die from day one and was glad when it did (died as in I can finally uninstall the app because Google isnt forcing me into it). That was the day that location sharing returned to where it should have been all along, Google Maps. Now I have to look forward to the failure of Allo/Duo so Google can return to a real all-in-one messaging platform like what Hangouts was becoming. Sadly it will probably be 3 years from now and nobody will care because they will be even farther behind than they already are. Fruity101079 I don't know if G+ is good or not, I never understand exactly how to navigate, explore, etc... Ui doesn't seem ergonomic, for me. Allen Martin G+ is actually a great platform in terms of what it offers and from a technology standpoint. It just doesn't have ubiquity, which makes it undesirable. And it's cool to make fun of the underdog. I actually use G+ as a news feed for tech news - and most tech news sites post to it regularly (even Android Police). If it ever goes away, I won't be upset but it would be cool if it realizes potential greater than what it is. derp_cookies I'm the owner of the C++ community on Google+ with just over 100,000 users. Spam is absolutely insane. Granted, they're pretty good at flagging spam, but I had to switch all posts to require moderation because it was so bad. My list of banned users is tens of thousands long. They definitely have a spam problem; maybe normal folks won't notice it, and it's more of an issue with communities? Also side note: Is it possible to read a headline somewhere about Google+ without the word "dead" in it? Kieron Quinn I'm an admin of the XDA community (unofficial, 188K members), we used to have loads of spam but it's dropped significantly recently. How many moderators do you have? derp_cookies About 4 at the moment. D.Smithee *crickets* abc Good. Can't wait for it to die. One less piece of Google bloatware on my phone.

The termination of Levandowski — who left Waymo/Google to found the self-driving truck firm Otto, which was then acquired by Uber — was first revealed through an internal staff email released yesterday. With regard to the ongoing lawsuit, Levandowski has been accused of stealing trade secrets from Waymo/Google relating to LiDAR tech which Uber then utilized, according to the company. “During the court proceedings, Levandowski exercised his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid providing testimony or handing over evidence regarding his use of proprietary data from his time at Google. Uber had previously warned that Levandowski could face consequences for his lack of compliance with his employment requirements at the company,” Autoblog reports. “Uber confirmed via a spokesperson that Levandowski was terminated following months of the company attempting to have him comply with and assist its own internal investigation into the matter, and had set a clear deadline for him to do so. Uber also noted that Eric Meyhofer, who stepped in when Levandowski was removed from his role leading ATG in April, will continue to lead the team and take over Levandowski’s direct reports.” It’s hard to know what to make of the situation. Is the account given by an Uber spokespersons mentioned above accurate? Or is it damage control? Is the company trying to wash its hands of the matter completely, and hoping that means it’s legal problems with Waymo/Google are over?

By Oscar Raymundo Staff Writer, Macworld | May 31, 2017 2:46 PM PT More like this WWDC wish list: What we’d like from the Siri Speaker Apple could finally launch a Siri speaker at WWDC Home is where the HomeKit wants to be Video How can Apple make iOS 11 upgrade-worthy? | The iPhone Show By the end of the year, Apple will have a Siri Speaker to compete against Amazon Echo and Google Home. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple has started overseas production of its Siri-enabled smart speaker. Apple could unveil this highly-anticipated Siri Speaker onstage during the WWDC keynote taking place on Monday, June 5, but the all-new device won’t be ready to ship until later this year. The Siri Speaker has been designed to compete against the Amazon Echo and Google Home. To differentiate itself from those other products, the Apple smart speaker will boast virtual surround sound and will be more seamlessly integrated with Apple products and services, like Apple Music. In addition, the Siri Speaker will give Apple users a new hub for controlling HomeKit-enabled devices around their home. [ Further reading: The best home water leak detectors ] Bloomberg also revealed that Apple won’t integrate a screen in its first iteration of the Siri Speaker. Earlier this month, Apple’s senior V.P. of Marketing Phil Schiller said that he wasn’t a fan of Amazon Echo or Google Home because they lacked screens. Days later, Amazon introduced Echo Show, a version of its flagship smart speaker with a touchscreen. The Siri Speaker is being produced by Inventec, the Taipei-based manufacturer already responsible for making the wireless AirPods. According to Bloomberg, the Siri Speaker has been in development for a long time, reaching the advanced prototype stage late last year. For several months now, Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their own homes. Why this matters: Apple is banking on a smart speaker with superior sound quality and deeper ties to the Apple ecosystem. Those two features seem certain, given the Beats ownership and the new W1 chip that can pair devices seamlessly. In addition, the Siri Speaker could include sensors to measure indoor acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels.  But will that be enough to make the Siri Speaker a must-have? Amazon is already ahead in bringing third-party apps to its Alexa-powered Echo devices, even Apple services like iCloud calendar are being brought to the fold. Meanwhile, Google has recently made its AI assistant available on iOS, pointing out some serious Siri fails. And HomeKit devices can already be operated using an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV.  To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

This online tool makes trip planning easier and more efficient.  The Google Transit app allows Gwinnett County Transit schedule data to be accessed via Google Maps, providing riders with step-by-step trip planning from their desktop computers or smartphones. By inputting their starting and ending points, Google will provide transit options available near those locations. Commuters also can access customized route data with multiple travel options.  “This is really helpful for a transit rider who is perhaps going to a new destination,” said Karen Winger, director of the Gwinnett County Transit Division. “You can input your typical starting point and your new destination and the system will identify what route and what mode of transit is available.” Don’t even try to trick the system. “It’s clever enough to know which starting and ending points aren’t anywhere near a transit system,” Winger said. The user can generate the route information from most smart phones. If personal computer is being used, the trip planning tool provides the option to send the route data to a smart phone as well. Additionally, this application supports 12 languages, which makes it more user-friendly in a multicultural county like Gwinnett. “Gwinnett County Transit is very excited to offer this tool,” said Winger. “We ask for riders to use Google Transit for their next trip and let us know what they think.” To access this tool, type Google Transit into a search engine. Choose Transit – Google Maps. A new screen appears and the user then types in the starting and ending points and hits enter. It’s that simple.

By Hiawatha Bray Globe Staff  May 31, 2017 Internet privacy has a new best friend, and it’s the last person you’d expect. US Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican chairman of the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee, helped overturn regulations from the Obama administration that required Internet providers such as Comcast Corp. to get their customers’ permission before tracking their online activities. Did those $87,000 in donations Blackburn received from telecommunications companies in the last election cycle have anything to do with that? Advertisement Maybe not. Suddenly, a lot of telecom lobbyists might want a refund. Just a few weeks after Congress repealed the Obama regulations, Blackburn and two other Republicans filed the Browser Act of 2017. The name is an acronym too silly to explain, but the goal is eminently sensible. Basically, it would mimic the regulations Blackburn successfully quashed, but go a good deal further, by requiring Google, Facebook, and other online services to also get our permission. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The regulations Blackburn opposed were enacted by the Federal Communications Commission, which does not oversee online services because they aren’t telecom companies. Google’s broadband business would have come under the FCC requirement, but its vast Internet advertising machine could keep right on tracking our every online move. Eliminating the FCC rules caused a ferocious backlash that may go a long way toward explaining Blackburn’s change of heart. Her bill would restore the regulations through the Federal Trade Commission, which also holds jurisdiction over online companies. And this time, the standards would apply to network operators and online businesses alike. If Google or Facebook or Comcast wanted to monitor your Web-surfing habits, they would have to ask permission first. Her basic argument is that the previous rules were unfair because they singled out only some of the companies we use to travel the Internet. Advertisement “The government should not pick winners and losers when it comes to the privacy of Americans,” Blackburn said. “This bill creates a level and fair privacy playing field by bringing all entities that collect and sell the personal data of individuals under the same rules.” Right now, online companies track us whether we agree to it or not. Getting our permission would be likely to hamper their ability to personalize ads, making them more generic and less precise — and much less profitable. But people who treasure their privacy will rest a a little easier. Public Knowledge, an Internet activist group which denounced Congress for abandoning the FCC rules, has praised the Blackburn bill. Not so Blackburn’s erstwhile fans. “In its current form the Browser Act is not the solution,” said Evan Swarztrauber, a spokesman for TechFreedom, a lobbying group funded by broadband carriers. Swarztrauber said the bill is full of ambiguous, unclear details that could discourage entrepreneurial innovation. The Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Google, and other online giants, isn’t happy, either. “This bill has the potential to upend the consumer experience online and stifle innovation,” said Noah Theran, the association’s vice president. Sure enough, Blackburn’s bill could cripple Google’s latest innovation in advertising: a way to track our shopping habits even when we’re not online. In May, Google announced relationships with companies that process about 70 percent of all credit and debit card transactions in US brick-and-mortar stores. If you see a Google ad and then go to a Walmart to purchase the item, the payment processor will let Google know about your transaction. That gives Google evidence that its ads work, so it can charge more for them. What’s wrong with that? Why should Google know what you buy at Walmart or Target or any other physical store? The whole reason this stuff is so creepy is that Google keeps aggregating more information about everything you do. First, it was what you do when you’re on Google. Then it became the Internet sites you visit when you leave Google. Then came Android, which lets Google follow you wherever you go. Now comes this new service that lets Google detect the stuff you buy at the corner store. Where next? The bathroom? Google insists the data it receives from the offline tracking service is anonymized, and so doesn’t pose a threat to your privacy. But it still unsettles Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union. “This is another step toward comprehensive commercial surveillance of individuals,” Stanley said, “and if it becomes normalized, there’s no telling how long those privacy protections will remain in place.” For now, the only protection we’ve got is Google’s promise to do right. I’d like a little more than that. I picked on Europe recently for trying to impose their Internet laws on the United States. Time to kiss and make up. I like a European Union plan, unveiled in January, that would require Web browsers to ask users if they accept tracking cookies like those used by Google and Facebook to monitor us. Unless the user explicitly agrees, such cookies would be forever blocked. Blackburn’s Browser Act is based on the same general principle. Want Yahoo and Amazon and Comcast to track you? Let them know. If not, they’ll have to leave you alone. Yes, there’s a downside: The drop in advertising revenues could do financial harm to smaller Internet services, maybe even to news sites like BostonGlobe.com. But our privacy is worth something too; we ought to keep at least a little of it. Blackburn’s bill offers us a fighting chance. Hiawatha Bray can be reached at hiawatha.bray@globe.com.

Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors.  (Gary Reyes / TNS FILE PHOTO)   By Mark Gurman Alex WebbBloomberg Wed., May 31, 2017 Apple Inc. is already in your pocket, on your desk and underneath your television. Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well. The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference in June, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said.  The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. Article Continued Below “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief executive officer Tim Cook has emphasized Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s $24 billion (U.S.). A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple has also considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Apple will also likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product. An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better.

Will Apple announce an Amazon Echo rival? Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Megan Wollerton 30 May 2017 11:41 pm BST @meganwollerton Top 5 features a Siri-powered speaker needs Apple is reportedly working on an Amazon Echo competitor. Here's what it would need to be a success. by Iyaz Akhtar 2:09 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Apple holds its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) confab on Monday, June 5. Will the company use the stage to show off its rumored rival to the Amazon Echo and Google Home? For Apple, a smart speaker would be a long time coming. Its smart home platform, HomeKit, was announced at WWDC 2014 -- months before the surprise unveiling of the first Amazon Echo. Three years later, we're still waiting for Apple to introduce a voice-control speaker that isn't tied to its mobile software iOS. Related stories Apple exec mocks Google Home and Amazon Echo Apple's Siri speaker could debut at WWDC Apple's Echo rival could see you with built-in camera Apple building Amazon Echo competitor, says report Voice-control speakers like the Amazon Echo and the Google Home have gone a long way to help unify our connected devices. Not only is voice control an easy entry point to device control for most family members, standalone speakers also help bring the functionality to the center of the home in a way that Apple's iOS-based HomeKit has not yet managed to do. You can ask Amazon's Alexa to set a 15-minute kitchen timer, to remind you to give your dog his heart worm pill -- and even to adjust the thermostat. You can use Google's Home to follow along with a recipe or to turn on your favorite Netflix show (with help from Chromecast). Apple's HomeKit can do a lot of the same things through its iOS 10 Home app and Siri, but input is limited to mobile devices, including the Apple Watch. (As of last year's MacOS Sierra update, Siri is on the Mac, too -- but it's far more limited.) Adding a standalone speaker to compete with Amazon and Google could go a long way to making Apple more competitive in the smart home space. If anything, the delay has helped fuel speculation about Apple's plans. Here's an overview of all of the rumors we've heard in the months leading up to WWDC 2017. (Note that Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.) 15 Look inside this $1 million Apple smart home Is it really happening? May 31, 2017: Apple has begun production on a smart speaker, according to a Bloomberg report published Wednesday. The article cites "people familiar with the matter," who said the device could be unveiled as early WWDC, but that it won't be available to customers until later this year. The Amazon Echo and Google Home rival will supposedly have surround sound and work with Apple HomeKit products.  An integrated touchscreen? May 6, 2017: Apple SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller suggested he wasn't impressed with the Amazon or Google speakers in an interview with India's Gadgets 360. "Well, I won't talk to either one specifically, [I] don't want to. My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all," Schiller said. He went on to address the importance of interacting with a screen. "There's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial," he said, "but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations." Amazon unveiled the $230 Echo Show on May 9, a touchscreen-equipped Alexa device that you can use for video calls or to view live security camera feeds. Google's Home speaker doesn't come with an integrated touchscreen. I personally don't like the idea of having a screen sitting on my coffee table or kitchen counter 24/7. I imagine the next step will be a Alexa-enabled control panel you'd hardwire like the Wink Relay or the Lucis NuBryte Touchpoint. Apple's speaker likely to debut at WWDC May 1, 2017: Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said, "We believe there is an over 50 [percent] chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June," in a MacRumors report. The story also claimed Apple's speaker will cost more than the Amazon Echo and work with AirPlay. If that price point is correct, Apple's speaker could cost more than any of the models sold today. Here's an overview of the current smart speaker lineup: Amazon Echo Show: $230 (available for preorder) Enlarge Image The $50 Amazon Echo Dot is the most affordable voice assistant available today. James Martin/CNET Amazon Echo Look: $200 (available by invitation) Amazon Echo: $180 Amazon Echo Dot: $50 Amazon Tap: $130 Google Home: $130 Read CNET's post on this news. A built-in camera? May 27, 2016: CNET reported that Apple's smart speaker might have an integrated camera. According to sources familiar with Apple's plans, the product would be able to recognize who's in a room via facial detection tech. Imagine walking near the device, having it recognize you and then automatically adjust the lights -- or the music to suit your preferences. Amazon introduced its camera-equipped $200 Echo Look back in April. Rather than being marketed as a security camera, the Echo Look is supposed to act as your very own style consultant. Google's Home doesn't currently have an integrated camera. The beginning May 24, 2016: Talk of a standalone Apple speaker, powered by Siri, was first reported by The Information. The story claims Apple had been discussing a developer-friendly version of Siri for years, before deciding to go ahead with the device. In addition, The Information reported that Apple's upcoming Echo and Home competitor would have a speaker and a microphone that you could use to play music, listen to news headlines -- and even control HomeKit-enabled devices.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Is Andy Rubin’s Amazon Echo competitor doomed to fail? John Brandon@jmbrandonbb May 31, 2017 2:10 PM Image Credit: Shutterstock.com/3d_kot What if you didn’t have to fiddle with gadgets all day? That’s the promise of ambient computing, a combination of AI and sensing technology in the future home and beyond. Imagine this scenario. You’re out with friends and you notice the weather has turned hot and sunny. That’s not a good thing for your new garden. Fortunately, a sensor triggers the sprinkler system, even though you didn’t set up a watering schedule. When one device in your home communicates with another, using AI to trigger events that help you (or at least give you an option to activate an event), that’s ambient computing. It depends on “sensing” in that the devices can act or prompt you for certain behaviors. Recently, Andy Rubin (known as the creator of Android, even though he says it was a team effort) announced a new product called Essential Home. It’s not a terrible product name, although “Essential” is a generic food brand and “Home” is the name of a similar Google product. The circular device runs on the new Ambient OS — or, I should say that it will run on the OS. There are no firm plans for when the product will ship, and the Essential site appears to show mock-up renders. That said, it looks like an interesting device. It resembles the Amazon Echo Dot a bit (as it’s shaped like a hockey puck) and functions like the Amazon Echo Show (since it has a screen). According to Essential, the device can sense other products on the same network, and — presumably using some open source trickery — offer to connect that device. There’s no technical explanation about how that will work. Rubin has also said the device could use the personal assistants from Amazon, Apple, or Google. If that’s anything like running the Google Assistant on your iPhone, where you can’t say “OK, Google,” it could be a problem. We want ease of use and ease of functionality. Still, the concept makes sense (ahem). We want smarter, more proactive devices. We want them to “just work” and sense other gadgets, regardless of whether they have a Samsung logo on the box or are only available from Lowe’s. Frankly, there are too many brands to worry about, too many apps, and not enough hours in the day. Last summer, when I installed a new security system, it didn’t connect to my thermostats or garage door openers. I don’t care about brand loyalty, I just need to park my car and turn on the air conditioning. The end user cares about utility. This is where AI plays such an important role. Sensing depends greatly on machine learning — a computer that thinks like a human. It has to be immensely powerful to work. If the Essential Home device senses my connected garage door openers and pre-conditions my house so it’s nice and cool by the time I drive up the road, it won’t matter to me which products or software were involved. I’ll be too tired after working all day to care. Now, I’m a little skeptical about all of this. Computers respond to the commands we write for them. The smart home uses software and apps that are branded and coded to work with certain hardware devices. If a Chamberlain garage door doesn’t work with a Nest thermostat, that’s not something Essential will be able to resolve on its own. It will need to get those two companies to work together, and open source software only helps to an extent. I’ve tested many of these products. When they are incompatible, there’s not much you can do. This is an uphill climb, but maybe Rubin and team can make it all work. The massive market share for Android is one indication of the team’s potential for success. We’ll know more when Essential releases more details about the product, hopefully soon.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 150 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. David Bowline No they won't. I'll bet you can call Google and set it up at the time. Use your noggin and quit jumping to conclusions before the fact. jonzey231 But you saying that is also jumping to conclusions, just on the other side of the argument. If you want to argue me, call Google and play it out. Report your findings here. Otherwise, your words mean no more or less than mine. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O David Bowline If Google is selling phones to a specific customer, who then turns around and sells them en masse, how is Google to know what was sold legally and what was stolen? Google has every right to blacklist those phones. Nobody forced anyone to buy a phone from some jerk on swappa. Its the responsibility of the middle man seller to take care of the problem, not Google. This isn't rocket science here. 4Ui812 You're right , it's not rocket science. If the phone is reported as stolen then it's ok to black list the IMEI. This story makes no mention of phones being stolen. Therefore like I said.... That's pretty shitty Google. A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff David Bowline Then Google can assume that they were stolen and blacklist them. It's not Googles fault here. JFC. SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that...

If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed... Amir What an idiotic move by Google. That's suicide. HardWired I wonder how long before Tesla implement a similar system in their cars :) Sorry you signed an agreement, the car has been disabled because you decided to sell it to a used car salesman for resale. Same sort of punishment that should not be legal.

Hint: It’s nothing to sneeze at At least we have a step up on Wisconsin, where the most searched-for spelling help is for 'Wisconsin,' according to Google. By Michelle LiuTribune News Service Share Comment Read Article MILWAUKEE — Google search figures show Wisconsinites can’t spell their own state name. A map tweeted by Google’s News Lab team Tuesday afternoon shows the top searched “how to spell” words in each state. For Texans and Missourians, that’s “maintenance.” Those in Washington, Alabama, Michigan and Maine alike wonder about “pneumonia,” while people in South Carolina stumble over “Chihuahua.” And the top word people have to Google to spell in Wisconsin? It’s … “Wisconsin.” Twitter users responded in amusement. “‘Wisconsin’” being the most misspelled word in Wisconsin is perfect,” Jamison Stolz, the executive editor of Abrams Press in New York, mused. “You gotta love the Cheeseheads,” WildCatReport.com managing editor Louie Vaccher said. Some were a little more horrified. “Wait … people in Wisconsin don’t know how to spell … WISCONSIN? Try Massachusetts!” tweeted user @melissalac. “I’m a Wisconsinite. This is embarrassing, LOL!” Twitter user @chocolateclipse said. Maybe the Wisconsinites should be glad they don’t live in New Hampshire. The most-searched-for spelling there: diarrhea.

Get Started: Prepare for Data While compiling your family tree, you’re going to get a lot of data to sift through. Whether this is dates and places of births and deaths, or stories, you’ll first need a way to collect it. I started my own family tree in about 1990 using a notebook and ballpoint pen. Dates and names, stories, details, and facts, were all jotted down in that pad on and off for five years, while the results were painstakingly written out, first in pencil, then in pen, on the plain side of a piece of disused wallpaper. Image Credit: Danny Ayers via Flickr Collecting data is hard work. Fortunately, you can make it easier. And you don’t have to store your database on the back of some wood chip! The bare bones of a family tree are names and dates. Following this come the stories, the facts, the events, and the sayings. People often say the same things over and over, intentionally or otherwise. These quotes are important in building an idea of the person. How can you use a Google tool to collect this information? Let’s find out. Use Forms for Facts and Stories We’ll assume you’re not researching your ancestry single-handed. Perhaps you have an elderly relative you can contact for help. The thing is, whoever you speak to may have difficulty remembering at the time you’re chatting. One way around this is to send over a form that they can fill in when memories strike. You can create an easy-to-email form using Google Docs. Begin by signing into your Google account, then go to drive.google.com. Here, click New > More > Google Forms > Blank Form. Give the form a title. I used “Family Memories” as I felt anything more formal (such as “Family Tree Questionnaire”) might seem too formal and create unnecessary barriers to engagement. You might like to add an encouraging description, too. Next, use the first default field and change its type from Multiple choice to Short answer. Give it a title, then click the + symbol on the right to add more. I used a form based on this: Your name. Who you’re remembering. Event you’re remembering. Your memories. Each of these had a Short answer space, except for the final question, which used the Paragraph option. This gives the respondent more space to contribute. Once you’re happy, click Send. You’ll then be able to select one or more people to email the form to. Add their email addresses, and click Send once more. You’ll see a notification when their responses are sent. This will appear in the Responses screen of the form. Using a Google form for family tree research is that easy! Other Google Drive Tricks It’s not just the Google Forms tool that you can use. Google Sheets, for instance, can be used to illustrate your family tree. This is a good way to get started, especially if you don’t have the funds for a family tree database application, or are unsure which one to use. Meanwhile, you can use your Google Drive storage to retain copies of any documents you find to photograph or scan. These will then be available in a pinch for you to refer to. Google Drive, synced to your PC, is simple to organize. Pro Tip: Make sure you keep a rigorous approach to naming folders and establishing directory structures. This will make it easy to find data that you’ve saved. For instance, create a directory for both sides of your family tree. Within these, create directories for individuals, based either on name, sex, or the century they were born. Once you have created individual folders for your ancestors, create additional folders. You might have one for photos, another for BMD certificates (that’s birth, marriage, and death), one for newspaper reports, etc. In short, Google Drive gives you a great starting point for managing your family tree. Use Google Search to Find Family History You know all about Google’s strength as a search engine. So, it should come as no surprise for you to learn that it can be used to research your family history. However: Google cannot help when it comes to data stored behind paywalls. If you need to access facts and figures stored at ancestry.com, then you’ll need to sign up for a free trial or one of their paid subscription plans. Image Credit: Evan Lorne via Shutterstock But Google can be used for other information. Newspaper reports, for instance, share considerable information, from business advertisements to probate notices. If these are indexed by Google, you’ll find them. Details about surnames and their etymology is also worth searching on Google. Other Google Searches might return useful images of people and places, details from the Google News archive of digitized newspapers, and information compiled in book form via Google Books. Pro Tip: You have other family members. You may have a few you’ve never met. If they have recorded their family tree, there is a chance that it has been published in some form. In this case, Google will find it. 10 Google Search Tips for Family Tree Research If you already know how to use Google Search effectively, you should be able to get to grips with these tips and tricks easily. It’s all about making sure the right search terms are used. For instance, remember that everything you type into the search box will be searched. Google silently adds “AND” between every search term — for instance, “make AND use AND of”. You can get around this using quotation marks around a search term: “makeuseof”. 1. Get Site-Specific Results Non-paywalled websites can be searched using Google with the site:SITEURL command. For instance: site:familysearch.org "stangoe, donald" This will search the specified site for results corresponding to the name “Donald Stangoe”. See our guide to getting the most out of Google search 8 Google Search Tips To Keep Handy At All Times 8 Google Search Tips To Keep Handy At All Times Figures don't lie, and the figures suggest that the majority of Internet users choose Google over the rest of the competition. With that in mind it's important to make sure all of those Google users... Read More for further tips. 2. Search for Page Titles Has that distant relative made individual page titles for your ancestors? Have they created detailed biographies? You can check this with a different Google search, that uses the allintitle command. allintitle: "Stangoe, Donald" Meanwhile, the text of the document can be searched with allintext: allintext: "Jefferson, John" Simple! 3. Use Date Ranges Google features a date-based search function, allowing you to narrow down to a particular range of years. This is perhaps the best Google search tip a genealogist might have at their disposal. To do this, specify the first and last years of the range, separated by two ellipses: "Martingell, Elizabeth" 1840..1855 Results will display entries from all dates in the range, inclusive of the two stated dates. 4. Specify a Year Another way to use dates is to specify a year in the search term that is relevant to the ancestor in question. For instance, you might try one of the BMD dates. "Thompson, Hannah" 1887 The intention is that this will display information about the individual’s birth, or from around the time of it. 5. Introduce Locations Similarly, you can add a location to your search, in a similar way: "Thompson, Hannah" 1887 Ferryhill Such a search would aim to find information on Hannah Thompson in the year of her birth, in the town of Ferryhill, in Country Durham, United Kingdom. 6. See Your Ancestor’s Home! Once you’ve found as much as you can using search terms, it’s time to use Google in more straightforward ways. For instance, after finding some information about an ancestor, you might have been given a clue as to where they were born. What better than to take a trip out and look at the property? The problem, of course, is that it might be inaccessible. It might also be a long drive, or even a flight, away. One sensible option is to use Google Maps to search for the address, then use Street View to view the building. 7. Revive Dead Sites Often when searching for family tree data, you’ll encounter websites that are offline. The best thing you can do here is to view an archive of the site. Click back in your browser window, and in the Google search results, click the green arrow under the name of the website. All you need to do is click Cached and wait for the page to load. Any problems, head to Archive.org and try your luck there. 8. Use Google Image Search While it is unlikely that you’ll find a long-lost photo of a mysterious great-grandfather, Google Image search can nevertheless prove useful. It can be used to examine remote locations, for instance, or get an idea of the clothes your forefathers might have worn. Image Credit: Karin Hildebrand Lau via Shutterstock Google Image search is also useful for finding images with text in them. This means that there is a chance that a scanned BMD certificate might show up using image search. 9. Cancel Irrelevant Results It’s difficult to get the results you’re looking for. Often, you’ll find a lot of interference; results that are nothing to do with the person or family you’re researching. In these situations, you simply need to re-run the search, this time “subtracting” the erroneous results. You do this by spotting the common element. For instance, you might find a lot of results for an ancestor born in Edinburgh, Scotland that point to them being born in Birmingham, Alabama. The easy way around this is to simply add… -birmingham …to the search request. The results will filter out anything that mentions Birmingham. 10. Customized Search Forms To get some real detail from your Google Search, the best thing you can do is construct a long search query. This is done using the AND and OR operators. But it can be time consuming and prone to error. Instead, you can try a customized search, such as this one at genealogy-search-help.com. Simply add in as much of the required information as you can, and click the button. The search term will be constructed, ready for you to use it and collect your results! Don’t Forget Google Alerts! One other thing to consider is Google Alerts. Once set up, this can be used to send links to your inbox whenever a search term you’ve been looking for is found. Typically, this means a website has published information relevant to the term. Our guide to Google Alerts will show you how to set it up. But what search terms should you use? I would recommend using a search term that relates to a pairing in your family tree, and the location the people lived. For instance, I’ve created an alert for two of my great-grandparents in Whitby, North Yorkshire. When anything is found by Google, the Google Alert will forward the corresponding link. Putting It All Together in a Tree The final aim of researching your family tree is to be able to present it visually. For this to be successful — and effective — you’ll need to find a suitable template that you can load up in a word processor. Google Docs is a good example! Where can you find useful templates for your family tree online? First, head to www.familytreetemplates.net, where you’ll find a collection of templates compatible with Google Docs.

Then take a look at this Google Sheets template that you can use to chart your ancestry back three generations. Finally check the templates linked to by Cyndi’s List. You’ll find over 200 useful templates, many of which can be opened in Google Docs. In fact, you should have Cyndi’s List bookmarked regardless. It’s truly one of the best genealogy resources on the web, although there are many others Top 10 Free Genealogy Websites to Find Ancestors Top 10 Free Genealogy Websites to Find Ancestors Without exaggerating, there are thousands of genealogy websites out there.

To come up with the list, which was released Tuesday, Google compiled all U.S. searches that included the phrase “how to spell” between January 1 and April 30 of this year. And the results, particularly in New England, are quite interesting. We've made a few corrections to the legend. This is the one to use pic.twitter.com/0Z8fUlzmHc — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 Apparently Massachusetts residents can’t spell “license,” and Rhode Islanders struggle with the four-letter word “liar.” The most commonly misspelled words in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont were “pneumonia,” “diarrhea,” and “Europe,” respectively. Advertisement And what word is causing Connecticut residents to turn to Google for help? It’s the title of a classic Mary Poppins tune, “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” Other notable mentions: New Jerseyans can’t spell the word “twelve,” people in Hawaii tend to flub the world “people,” and Wisconsinites are unsure about the spelling of, well, Wisconsin. Hey, at least this year, Massachusetts residents can spell the name of their own state. TOPICS: Local News New England Want to see what readers are saying about our stories?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Amazon.com (AMZN) is the Newest Member of the $1000 Club Shutterstock photo Amazon.com, Inc.AMZN finally touched the coveted $1000 price milestone. Shares hit a new all-time high of $1001.2 on May 30, before closing a tad bit lower at $996.7. Notably, it is the fifth company to have a quadruple digit price tag after Berkshire Hathaway’s Class A shares, Seaboard, NVR Inc. and Priceline PCLN . Amazon has had an impressive run on the bourse since its inception as a public limited company. The stock has gained a mammoth 66103.3% since it went public and 38% over the last one year. Reportedly, Jeff Bezos’ 17% stake in Amazon was worth about $80.3 billion when the company’s shares touched $1,000 in early trading on Tuesday. Per Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index, Bezos’ total net worth is $85 billion, just behind Warren Buffett, whose total net worth is $88.8 billion. Given the pace at which Amazon’s share are surging, Bezos is well poised to become the richest man in the world. Amazon Riding High on Prime, AWS and IoT Retail : Amazon’s retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. The company has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) strategy. Content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships to get more people to Prime and generate increased sales for Amazon. Prime memberships help in repeat sales of not just general merchandise but also media (books, music, video, etc). AWS: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the cash cow for Amazon. It generates much higher margins than retail and is driving Amazon’s profitability. The company is the dominant name in the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) market, with rival services like Microsoft’s MSFT Azure and Google Cloud Platform way behind. According to synergy research group, AWS had over 40% share of the public cloud market at the end of 2016 with Microsoft, IBM and Google GOOGL together accounting for 23%. IoT: Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home, which has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth in a very short time. The company is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it’s safe to say that it has taken an early lead over Google’s smart assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote There’s Still Room for Upside Video: Amazon’s current focus is on building video content, primarily for Prime subscribers because the growth prospects in the market are considerable. According to marketsandmarkets, the global video streaming market is expected to witness compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3%. It is expected to grow from $30.29 billion in 2016 to $70.05 billion by 2021. Brick and Mortar: Amazon’s accelerated brick-and-mortar efforts appear to be a counter strategy against slow growth and mounting competition in e-commerce. Amazon now has seven bookstores across New York, Seattle, San Diego, Chicago, Portland, and Massachusetts in the U.S. The company is going the brick-and-mortar way with other merchandise as well. Its first brick-and-mortar grocery store branded Amazon Go is expected to open in Seattle and will offer a „check-out free” experience to customers. Logistics: Amazon has been investing heavily in building air cargo hubs, leasing planes, purchasing trucks and designing drones. The company’s Chinese arm has filed with Chinese authorities as a handler of goods bound for ports in Japan, Europe and the U.S. The accelerated push toward building its own in-house shipping and logistics service is positive. Amazon is not only developing an alternative to traditional shippers like FedEx and United Parcel Service for its own logistical needs but also has the potential to become a challenger to these established players in the long haul. International Expansion: Amazon is expanding in a big way in India and has already pumped $5 billion into its Indian operations. It launched Prime Video in India and Prime membership in Mexico. Amazon took over Souq.com to strengthen its foothold in the Middle East. The deal should help it to establish a presence in countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. What we think has particularly impressed investors about this deal is that Amazon is picking up the buy option over build. This means that Amazon will start generating revenues in the region right way without wasting any time in building its own infrastructure. Additionally, from winning distribution rights to adding advantages to Prime subscribers in international markets, Amazon is leaving no stone unturned to boost its digital media sales across the globe. The efforts should expand Amazon’s video portfolio outside the U.S., thereby boosting its international presence. If Amazon could repeat its domestic success internationally, there is scope for further growth. To Conclude Calling Amazon the world’s largest online retailer would be too little to reflect its enormous power. The company capitalizes largely on its execution strength, robust performance and technological prowess. When you invest in Amazon, you invest in a very well diversified portfolio. This is because the company has its finger in almost every pie. So don’t mind paying $1000 for a stock that shows a clear path to profitability. Amazon shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In fact, Mayer, 42, has just been ranked the least likable CEO in tech, according to a new survey from Owler, a business insights website. Owler compiled rankings from its business professionals community and used an algorithm to analyze over 250,000 ratings. That process led to a list of the most likable CEOs across 50 cities and 25 industries. Mayer performed the worst of all public tech company CEOs with a 32.8 rating out of 100, falling short of the industry's 69.7 average rating. While tech leaders represented nearly half of the 50 most likable CEOs of U.S. public companies, the Yahoo executive also earned the second-lowest rating of all public company CEOs — just one ranking above United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz. Mayer's low rating might not come as a surprise to most, as she has been widely criticized for her leadership since becoming Yahoo's chief executive in July 2012. After demanding that the company's remote employees resume working from the office, routinely arriving late to meetings and being called a micromanager by Yahoo insiders, Mayer has not gotten much of a break from public and employee disapproval. Mayer might not hold onto her title as CEO for much longer anyway, as she's expected to leave the company in June when Verizon finishes its $4.48 billion acquisition of Yahoo. Former Yahoo president Sue Decker recently criticized the company's performance and Mayer's anticipated $186 million payout . In 2016, the New York Times detailed Yahoo employees' low morale and lack of faith in Mayer. "Marissa is the type of boss that makes you feel like you're disappointing her at all times, so I always feel like I'm on the verge of being fired," Jeff Bonforte, Yahoo's senior vice president for communications products, tells the New York Times. Interestingly, he also praised Mayer as the best boss he's ever had. Mayer's mistakes as a leader are similar to those most bosses make . As noted by former Google executive and sought-after Silicon Valley CEO coach Kim Scott, having one person make the majority of a team's decisions, both granular and strategic, can hurt the group's performance in the long run. Researchers say good bosses are hard to come by , but as one of the highest-paid female CEOs and a leader in the tech industry, Mayer could probably use a few tips to become a more well-liked boss .

There are more than 500 million art-related searches on Google every month. The team from Google Arts & Culture got together with the search team to make these results more than just a list of images and Wikipedia links. Now, you'll see high-resolution collections, knowledge panels, better indoor Street View experiences, and more. The improvements are split into two distinct parts. If you head over to Google and do a search for an artist or artwork, the search engine will better understand how to help you explore the topic. You get an interactive knowledge panel with information on artists, related works, and more. There are also high-resolution images that you can zoom in to get a better look at. Google Street View is also getting some more art-friendly features. Specifically, the indoor Street View museum experiences. Google used machine learning to scan the walls of participating museums and identify works of art. When wandering through these places on the web and mobile app, you will see handy annotations next to each piece. Clicking on them takes you to a new page with more info and high-resolution images for zooming in close. Both these features are rolling out to users now. Keep an eye out.

Bloomberg sources say the Cupertino giant could, as previously rumored, choose to introduce the Amazon Echo rival less than a week from now during its Worldwide Developers’ Conference on June 5. According to the people ‘familiar with the matter’ Apple will be able to differentiate itself from the Echo and Google Home by offering ‘virtual surround sound tech’ and ‘deep integration’ with other Apple products. That last part appears to be crucial. As well as a home hub for HomeKit-enabled devices, Apple is also hoping this device will help keep customers ‘locked in’ to its wider ecosystem, according to the report. For example, the Google Home and Amazon Echo don’t support Apple Music, which may lead consumers to stream from Spotify, rather than sign up for Apple’s platform. This hardware could ward off that threat. Related: Amazon Echo vs Google Home The sources say the speaker will be louder and ‘reproduce sound more crisply’ than the Echo and Google Home, neither of which are too hot as standalone speakers. The company is also looking to tailor the audio to users’ living environments by adding sensors to measure room acoustics, according to today’s piece. If today's report proves accurate. Apple will also embrace third-party services through the Siri-controlled speaker, as it did within iOS 10 last year. Users will be able to book an Uber or send WhatsApp messages, the report suggests. In another interesting note, according to the report, Inventec, the company behind the recent release of AirPods is said to be in charge of the production. Has the delay in entering the market allowed Apple to get this release just right?

Today, Oculus and Samsung scooped Google a bit by announcing that Chromecast streaming is already ready for its Gear VR platform.  With the latest version of the Oculus app on your supported Galaxy device, you should now see a Cast button towards the top right corner (image above). A simple tap on that button, followed by the selection of the device you want to Cast to, will get you into a VR-sharing session. It should be that simple.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Cars Image Source: Uber Waze Carpool, Google’s actual ridesharing service, expands to California Chris Smith @chris_writes May 31st, 2017 at 3:52 PM Share Tweet Google is slowly expanding the reach of its own Uber rival, and Uber should be worrying about that prospect, especially given that it just infuriated Google over related car-business matters. Don't Miss: Amazon has a lightning-fast 256GB microSD card on sale at its lowest price ever Google’s Waze Carpool is going to be available all across California by June 6th, the company’s head of business development Josh Fried told Recode. The service was available only in the Bay Area and Israel, but Waze Carpool plans to launch in Brazil in the future. What’s also interesting about this particular move is that Waze Carpool will also start showing ads to users to make money. That’s also one hint that Google plans to make the app available to more people. That would be one other way for Google to deliver advertising to more people. Only recently, Google’s Sundar Pichai hinted that ads will be shown in Google Maps, so it’s not surprising to see Waze Carpool getting this particular treatment. Currently, Waze Carpool isn’t making any money. The app charges riders what it calculates as their share of the cost of gas for a ride, and the driver gets everything. In the future, Waze Carpool could also take a commission, Fried told Recode. For the time being, Waze Carpool and Waymo won’t be working together, Fried revealed. “Waze is thinking about the driver experience today, and self-driving cars are not ready for the mainstream, but traffic is here and now,” he said. But it wouldn’t be surprising to see this particular scenario play out soon, especially in a future where Google would want to compete against Uber in a self-driving ride-sharing business.

(AP / Jeff Chiu) The Canadian Press Published Wednesday, May 31, 2017 3:28PM EDT Google's Android Pay, a mobile wallet that allows people to pay with their smartphone, is available for Canadians to download starting Wednesday. Users can pay with the app in stores that accept contactless payment and on apps such as Uber and Lululemon that have an Android Pay button. Android Pay will work with Visa and MasterCard credit cards from Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Scotiabank, National Bank, Desjardins, President's Choice Financial, ATB Financial and Canadian Tire Financial Services. On Monday, Google will start to roll out support for Interac cards from those banks. Missing from the list of partners are TD Bank and Royal Bank, which both offer in-house digital wallets that are compatible with some Android devices. Pali Bhat, vice-president of Google payments, said the company expects to add more banks to the pay system. Android Pay comes to Canada more than a year after Apple Pay became available in the country. The Android app, which is already in use in 11 other countries, will work on all NFC-enabled Android devices running on the operating system KitKat 4.4 or higher.

Words like “beautiful” and “pneumonia” seem to be among the most commonly searched terms across the country, and words like “sense,” “quote” and “nanny” are the most misspelled words in Oregon, Idaho and Mississippi, respectively, the data shows. “Tomorrow” is a word that residents in Arizona and Colorado have a hard time spelling and people in Texas and Missouri commonly misspell “maintenance,” according to the Google map. However, it looks as though the people at Google may need a little help themselves spelling the word “ninety,” as it was misspelled in the original map next to Washington, D.C.

Login Search Amazon.com (AMZN) is the Newest Member of the $1000 Club May 31, 2017, 01:16:00 PM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo Amazon.com, Inc.AMZN finally touched the coveted $1000 price milestone. Shares hit a new all-time high of $1001.2 on May 30, before closing a tad bit lower at $996.7. Notably, it is the fifth company to have a quadruple digit price tag after Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares, Seaboard, NVR Inc. and Priceline PCLN . Amazon has had an impressive run on the bourse since its inception as a public limited company. The stock has gained a mammoth 66103.3% since it went public and 38% over the last one year. Reportedly, Jeff Bezos' 17% stake in Amazon was worth about $80.3 billion when the company's shares touched $1,000 in early trading on Tuesday. Per Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, Bezos' total net worth is $85 billion, just behind Warren Buffett, whose total net worth is $88.8 billion. Given the pace at which Amazon's share are surging, Bezos is well poised to become the richest man in the world. Amazon Riding High on Prime, AWS and IoT Retail : Amazon's retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. The company has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) strategy. Content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships to get more people to Prime and generate increased sales for Amazon. Prime memberships help in repeat sales of not just general merchandise but also media (books, music, video, etc). AWS: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the cash cow for Amazon. It generates much higher margins than retail and is driving Amazon's profitability. The company is the dominant name in the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) market, with rival services like Microsoft's MSFT Azure and Google Cloud Platform way behind. According to synergy research group, AWS had over 40% share of the public cloud market at the end of 2016 with Microsoft, IBM and Google GOOGL together accounting for 23%. IoT: Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home, which has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth in a very short time. The company is racing to build an ecosystem around Alexa and it's safe to say that it has taken an early lead over Google's smart assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote There's Still Room for Upside Video: Amazon's current focus is on building video content, primarily for Prime subscribers because the growth prospects in the market are considerable. According to marketsandmarkets, the global video streaming market is expected to witness compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3%. It is expected to grow from $30.29 billion in 2016 to $70.05 billion by 2021. Brick and Mortar: Amazon's accelerated brick-and-mortar efforts appear to be a counter strategy against slow growth and mounting competition in e-commerce. Amazon now has seven bookstores across New York, Seattle, San Diego, Chicago, Portland, and Massachusetts in the U.S. The company is going the brick-and-mortar way with other merchandise as well. Its first brick-and-mortar grocery store branded Amazon Go is expected to open in Seattle and will offer a "check-out free" experience to customers. Logistics: Amazon has been investing heavily in building air cargo hubs, leasing planes, purchasing trucks and designing drones. The company's Chinese arm has filed with Chinese authorities as a handler of goods bound for ports in Japan, Europe and the U.S. The accelerated push toward building its own in-house shipping and logistics service is positive. Amazon is not only developing an alternative to traditional shippers like FedEx and United Parcel Service for its own logistical needs but also has the potential to become a challenger to these established players in the long haul. International Expansion: Amazon is expanding in a big way in India and has already pumped $5 billion into its Indian operations. It launched Prime Video in India and Prime membership in Mexico. Amazon took over Souq.com to strengthen its foothold in the Middle East. The deal should help it to establish a presence in countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. What we think has particularly impressed investors about this deal is that Amazon is picking up the buy option over build. This means that Amazon will start generating revenues in the region right way without wasting any time in building its own infrastructure. Additionally, from winning distribution rights to adding advantages to Prime subscribers in international markets, Amazon is leaving no stone unturned to boost its digital media sales across the globe. The efforts should expand Amazon's video portfolio outside the U.S., thereby boosting its international presence. If Amazon could repeat its domestic success internationally, there is scope for further growth. To Conclude Calling Amazon the world's largest online retailer would be too little to reflect its enormous power. The company capitalizes largely on its execution strength, robust performance and technological prowess. When you invest in Amazon, you invest in a very well diversified portfolio. This is because the company has its finger in almost every pie. So don't mind paying $1000 for a stock that shows a clear path to profitability. Amazon shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Roston - May 31, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Everybody has a word or two they can’t seem to spell correctly, and the go-to solution to get the correct spelling is usually Google. Open a web browser, navigate to Google, type in the word, and then get the correct spelling in the search results. That’s convenient for users, and it also provides Google with a bunch of data on how well the people in each state spell. Based on its data, Google Trends has just released a map showing the most misspelled word in every US state. The majority of most-misspelled words fall in the 6 to 10 characters range, though there are a few words with five or less characters, and only a couple with more than 20 characters…and both of those are ‘supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.’ Perhaps the most shameful among the words are simple things like ‘gray’ and ‘chaos.’ America's most misspelled words – it's #spellingbee week and we mapped top "how to spell" searches by state#dataviz pic.twitter.com/oHkRHj8Eku — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 We see some repeated words on the list, with both pneumonia (Washington, Maine, Michigan) and beautiful (California, Ohio, Minnesota) being repeat offenders. There are even a couple points of humor, such as Wisconsin’s most misspelled word being ‘Wisconsin.’ Other misspelled words include ‘surprise,’ ‘dilemma,’ ‘vacuum,’ ‘sauerkraut,’ ‘delicious,’ ‘receipt,’ ‘suspicious,’ and ‘hallelujah.’ This isn’t the first time Google has published a list of the nation’s most misspelled words. The company did the same thing last year, and while some of the words remain the same — such as ‘pneumonia’ for Washington — most others have changed.

Live Watch The most misspelled words in every state, according to Google By COURTNEY CONNLEY May 31, 2017, 2:21 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayGoogle Trends WATCH 6-year-old girl competes in Scripps National Spelling Bee 0 Shares Email For New Yorkers, it's "beautiful." For Pennsylvanians, it's "sauerkraut." And for Wisconsinites, it's, well, "Wisconsin." Just in time for the 90th Scripps National Spelling Bee — which started on May 28 and runs through June 4 — Google Trends has released a map of "America's most misspelled words." The map, based on data from Jan. 1, 2017, to April 30, 2017, breaks down the most commonly searched "how to spell" words by state, according to Google. "Beautiful" and "pneumonia" are among the words most commonly searched for spelling across the country, and "sense," "quote" and "nanny" are the most searched words for spelling in Oregon, Idaho and Mississippi, respectively, the data show. "Tomorrow" is only a search away for residents of Arizona and Colorado, and people in Texas and Missouri commonly wonder about "maintenance," according to the Google map. However, it appears that the people at Google may need a little spelling help themselves, misspelling "ninety" as "nintey" next to Washington, D.C., on the map before posting a corrected version.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content YouTube App update launches with major UI changes By Martin Brinkmann on May 31, 2017 in Music and Video - Last Update:May 31, 2017 2 Google launched a new version of the YouTube application today on iOS and Android which comes with major changes to the apps' interface. Changing the interface of an app that has been around for some time is always a daunting task. It is almost guaranteed that part of the user base will dislike the change. Google notes that the update "provides a consistent layout across mobile" and "allows for easier navigation within the app". The biggest change of the update is the moving of the top navigational bar to the bottom of the screen.  The old application on Android used the following layout. The main navigation tabs, Home, Trending and Subscriptions have been moved to the bottom of the screen in the updated YouTube application. While those three were moved to the bottom, Account was not. In fact, you find account a row higher from its initial position in the old layout; it is now located at the rightmost side of the top toolbar of the YouTube application. But Account does not list all the links anymore that it listed previously either, as some of them have been moved as well. If you are looking for your YouTube History, the videos you uploaded to YouTube (my videos), or your playlists, you will notice that they have been moved to the new library menu at the bottom of the screen. The top toolbar features new options as well. You find the new Cast button attached to it there, and there is a link to the camera of the device as well there now. The camera was previously available on the account page from where you could run a new show. So, Home, Trending, subscriptions and Library are at the bottom, account and search are still at the top, and Cast and Camera are two new options up there as well. Account lists settings and user account related information, while library anything that has to to with videos. One great new feature of the app is that it remembers now where you left off on each tab. If you scrolled down the trending videos for instance, switched to subscriptions, and go back to trending, you can continue where you left off before you switched tabs. One thing that is not so good is that Google removed the option to swipe to flip to another tab. This means that you need to tap on the icons now instead to switch from one tab to another in the application. Apple iOS users should have access to the new version of the YouTube application already if they have updated it to the latest version. The app roll out is slower on Android, where users get access to the feature gradually. If you don't have access to it yet, you will have to wait until the roll out reaches your device. Now You: What's your take on the new UI of the YouTube app?   Summary Article Name YouTube App update launches with major UI changes Description Google launched a new version of the YouTube application today on iOS and Android which comes with major changes to the apps' interface.

I don't know why google went to all this work to make a unified app design across their whole platform just to throw it all away /once again/. "A consistent layout across mobile" Yeah, maybe if you're on iOS. Sticks out like a sore thumb on Android though. Reply MdN June 1, 2017 at 1:37 am # I like it, one less nuisance. Nokia Belle only sometimes had tabs on top, everything else was reachable at the bottom. Now I hate my life a little every time I have to stretch my thumb across 5 inches to tap on an option (or use the other hand). No wonder so many phones nowadays have cracked screens.

Users can pay with the app in stores that accept contactless payment and on apps such as Uber and Lululemon that have an Android Pay button. Android Pay will work with Visa and MasterCard credit cards from Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Scotiabank, National Bank, Desjardins, President’s Choice Financial, ATB Financial and Canadian Tire Financial Services. On Monday, Google will start to roll out support for Interac cards from those banks. Missing from the list of partners are TD Bank and Royal Bank, which both offer in-house digital wallets that are compatible with some Android devices. Pali Bhat, vice-president of Google payments, said the company expects to add more banks to the pay system. Android Pay comes to Canada more than a year after Apple Pay became available in the country. The Android app, which is already in use in 11 other countries, will work on all NFC-enabled Android devices running on the operating system KitKat 4.4 or higher.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google says it is using a new method to identify and target phishing attempts within Gmail. Moving forward, Google is using a new algorithm that "flags and delays potentially suspicious messages." Google says this selective delay allows it to spend more time investigating potentially suspicious messages before they are delivered. Google uses the time to perform additional content checks on the message to ensure its authenticity. The delay may last up to four minutes, which Google feels is an acceptable length of time to hold potentially nefarious messages. Emails that remain suspicious after these checks are routed to Gmail users' spam folders. Google says despite its high success rate (99.99%), businesses should continue to use their own anti-phishing and malware services. This change is rolling out to all Gmail users this week. more info at Google » Related Gmail for Android Now Warns of Phishing Attempts Google has updated Gmail for Android with a new security feature. Moving forward, links within emails that lead to suspicious sites will call up a warning from Google. Gmail to Call Out Insecure Emails Google is hoping to protect Gmail users by making them more aware of secure and insecure messages. Moving forward, Gmail will display an open lock icon for Google Apps users who receive messages from email services that don't support an encrypted connection. Google to Strip SMS from Hangouts May 22 Google today outlined a number of changes to its various messaging services, including a dramatic shift for Hangouts. Starting May 22, Google Hangouts will no longer support SMS for text messaging between phones. Smart Replies Headed to Gmail Google today said Gmail will soon support smart replies, or automatic responses to emails. The tool is being carried over from Google's Allo messaging application. Google to Warn Gmail Users of Insecure Emails Google said it intends to offer warnings to users of its Gmail service when they receive emails that arrive through non-encrypted connections. A recent report published by Google and several research partners demonstrates that email on a whole is safer than it was two years ago, but some risks remain. more news about:   AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Wednesday, May 31, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] A Year of Google Maps & Apple Maps Justin O’Beirne (Hacker News): According to Google Analytics, that essay has received more than 1,000 hits from computers on Apple’s corporate network, mainly Apple’s Sunnyvale and Cupertino campuses. Yet nearly a year later, Patricia’s Green still isn’t green. […] Google has distinct locations for each. But Apple plots them at the same location... […] ...and as the months pass by, Apple cycles through all three – padding our addition/removal counts[…] […] Speaking of place labels, did you notice that halfway through the year, Google’s changed in appearance? […] And in addition to the color changes, Google also flattened the map – eliminating the coastline dropshadows it had added just a couple years ago and removing most of the road casings[…] […] And speaking of places, Google has also been increasing the variety of places it shows. Nick Heer: I hope Apple’s on-the-ground data collection indicates that they’re pushing for a big improvement soon. But, while they may be working really hard, Google’s designers and engineers aren’t twiddling their thumbs either, and Google is starting with a much stronger base. This article is so good that Apple could almost use it as a todo list. And they probably should. O’Beirne was apparently the “Head of Cartography” at Apple, but given this essay and the one last year, it sounds like he no longer works there.

SHARES If you ever landed a job interview at Google with co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, you'd expect the questions to be difficult. You probably wouldn't expect to have to interview yourself. In a recent interview with Business Insider, AOL CEO and former Google exec Tim Armstrong described the unusual interviewing tactic used by Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. "I don't think I've ever told this story," Armstrong says. "But when I had my first discussion with them, they basically said at the beginning of the meeting, after a few questions, 'We're not really sure what to ask you. Ask yourself the questions. "'Like, what questions would you ask yourself, if you were us?'" Katie Kramer | CNBC Tim Armstrong In other words, Page and Brin asked Armstrong to interview himself in front of them. "So I said, 'Look, I'm a very direct person, very honest. Here's what I would ask, the following questions,'" he recalls. "I thought that was interesting," Armstrong says about the unorthodox interview. Over the next decade, Armstrong became an important player in Google's exponential growth, including spearheading the company's AdSense division. After holding multiple C-level positions, he left the company in 2009 to lead AOL. Armstrong wasn't the only one the Google co-founders used this tactic on. "I realized later, after working with them, that that was not an anomaly," he said. "That was one of their tactics." Google has long held a reputation for its difficult interviews. In the past, candidates had to wrangle with brainteaser questions such as, "How many times a day does a clock's hands overlap?" and, "Estimate how many gas stations there are in Manhattan." Hiring managers have since moved on to asking behavioral questions such as, "Describe a time when you solved a difficult problem," which they've found to be better predictors of on-the-job success. But while Google job applicants are less likely to have to figure out impossible scenarios on the spot, they might want to take a few minutes to mentally prepare for a curveball question, including the interview question you would ask yourself. Check out the one interview question this IBM exec asks every applicant. show chapters Google’s head of mobile brand strategy shares the email trick that helped him land his job    Thursday, 16 Mar 2017 | 10:07 AM ET | 01:05 Marguerite WardReporter, CNBC Make It Primetime Shows Watch full episodes | TV schedule To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Hint: It’s nothing to sneeze at At least we have a step up on Wisconsin, where the most searched-for spelling help is for 'Wisconsin,' according to Google. By Michelle LiuTribune News Service Share Comment Read Article MILWAUKEE — Google search figures show Wisconsinites can’t spell their own state name. A map tweeted by Google’s News Lab team Tuesday afternoon shows the top searched “how to spell” words in each state. For Texans and Missourians, that’s “maintenance.” Those in Washington, Alabama, Michigan and Maine alike wonder about “pneumonia,” while people in South Carolina stumble over “Chihuahua.” And the top word people have to Google to spell in Wisconsin? It’s … “Wisconsin.” Twitter users responded in amusement. “‘Wisconsin'” being the most misspelled word in Wisconsin is perfect,” Jamison Stolz, the executive editor of Abrams Press in New York, mused. “You gotta love the Cheeseheads,” WildCatReport.com managing editor Louie Vaccher said. Some were a little more horrified. “Wait … people in Wisconsin don’t know how to spell … WISCONSIN? Try Massachusetts!” tweeted user @melissalac. “I’m a Wisconsinite. This is embarrassing, LOL!” Twitter user @chocolateclipse said. Maybe the Wisconsinites should be glad they don’t live in New Hampshire. The most-searched-for spelling there: diarrhea.

Author: Lily Hay Newman. Lily Hay Newman Security Date of Publication: 05.31.17. 05.31.17 Time of Publication: 3:23 pm. 3:23 pm Inside Google’s Global Campaign to Shut Down Phishing Getty Images At the beginning of May, a phishing scam flooded the web, disguised as a typical Google Docs request. Some of the emails even appeared to come from acquaintances. If victims clicked through and granted seemingly innocuous permissions, they exposed their entire Gmail account to whoever was behind the scam. It was an explosive scheme. And Google responded in kind. “We convened what we call a war room,” says Mark Risher, Google’s director of counter-abuse technology. “Basically we pulled people together in a physical room here in Mountain View, California, and we also had experts from many other offices around the company that quickly came together. Each specialty gets called in.” More Google Security Lily Hay Newman Don’t Open That Google Doc Unless You’re Positive It’s Legit Lily Hay Newman Phishing Scams Even Fool Tech Nerds—Here’s How to Avoid Them Andy Greenberg Google’s Chrome Hackers Are About to Upend Your Idea of Web Security Unfortunately, that sort of crisis response is all too common for Google. Its massive user base and footprint on the web make its services and customers prominent targets for every imaginable phishing attack, not to mention all the other manner of hacks and assaults. But phishing presents an especially tricky problem. Campaigns are hard to spot by design, and also evolve rapidly. “The bad guys try hard, so we are motivated to try even harder,” says Sri Somanchi, a project manager in the Gmail anti-abuse team. “We keep going because we know that any little slip up on our side is going to have a huge cost for users.” That response can take many forms. And if they’re doing their job right, you barely even notice. Phish Fry When the Google Docs phish spiked—affecting 0.1 percent of Gmail users, or about 1 million accounts—Google anti-abuse teams started by sharing information, and hammering out shifts across Google offices around the world to ensure 24-hour coverage. “There’s a team that’s working specifically on Gmail inbounds, they’re trying to make sure that the email messages are not getting spread,” Risher says. “There’s another team that’s working on account abuse patterns, and they’re trying to look at who is using the credentials that have been accessed. There’s a third team that’s looking at the spread of this message.” Within a few hours, Google had stopped the phishing attempt from spreading further. Within a day, Google rolled out expanded anti-phishing security warnings for Gmail on Android. That joins a handful of other anti-phishing and threat-warning tools that Google has debuted over the last several years, like the Chrome extension Password Alert, which cautions you if it thinks you just entered your Google username and password into an imposter login page. The company also announced new phishing protections targeted at business users on Wednesday, including warnings when enterprise users attempt to send data outside their company, and additional ransomware protections. Google works to make it as easy as possible for users to make safe choices and avoid scams, but the company’s focus is on tech solutions that are meant to work seamlessly with minimal user buy-in. Some phishing specialists believe that emphasizing user training is the real key to stopping phishing, but as Aaron Higbee, the CTO of the user-training firm PhishMe, puts it, “We need technology to do as much as it can. For Google they have to pursue that.” Focusing on technological solutions plays to Google’s strengths. One example is Google’s Safe Browsing infrastructure, which displays warning messages across Chrome, Android, Search, and Gmail if you try to access a potentially malicious site or download. Google also makes Safe Browsing available to third-party developers—browsers like Mozilla’s Firefox and Apple’s Safari incorporate it. And Google uses Safe Browsing in its Ads service to catch ads that attempt to promote malicious content. In all, the company says that Safe Browsing benefits two billion devices per day. Safe Browsing warnings give a boost to internet users who may feel overwhelmed by the daily barrage of digital threats. But for Google, the service reflects a long-term investment that originated over a decade ago. As Google crawls the internet for its flagship search engine, it uses that data to flag malicious pages that host social engineering attacks, malware, phishing campaigns, and more. “For a lot of users their main interaction with Safe Browsing is a big red warning page,” says Allison Miller, who leads the Safe Browsing team and also works with Google’s Threat Analysis Group. That belies how much work happens behind the scenes to generate those warnings in the first place—and the huge scale of the challenge. “We have to guard every door, every window, every opening, and the bad guys just need to get through one,” Risher says. “It can be tough when most of your moments of fame and glory are something bad happened and you were able to stop it before it got too bad.” First Line of Defense Hundreds of Google employees work on security and anti-abuse at every level. Their approach hinges on numerous layers of protection, a strategy known as defense in depth. The first layer of defense between phishers and your Gmail account is an automated bulk filtering process, which draws on Safe Browsing and other black-listing tools that blocks a huge amount of junk. Actually, huge might not cover it. Google blocks as much as 90 percent of the email volume sent to Gmail before it ever reaches users. And no, that doesn’t include what lands in your spam folder. “A lot of this is achieved through maintaining the reputation of every sender of the world,” Somanchi says. “As we keep receiving emails we compute reputation on thousands of email attributes, and then we use these reputations to pre-determine if a sender is legitimate or shady.” Google also scans for bad links, meaning if you accidentally sent a known phishing link to a friend from Gmail, it won’t deliver it no matter how sterling your email rep. It gets even more granular from there. Google subjects messages that make the first cut to even more intense filtering, during which Gmail looks for impersonations and forgeries as it decides whether to plop a message into your spam folder or inbox. In cases of uncertainty, it’ll let the message through, but add a banner warning that it may have been sent from a compromised account. Similarly, if Gmail doesn’t have enough information to make a final determination about an email, it may deliver it but with protections in place, like adding warnings and disabling the email’s links or attachments. Rather than rely on one or two cure-alls, Gmail provides layers. “Even if the bad guys have collected your password they still should not be able to use it, and even if they are able to use it what they do in the account is part of our continuous risk-based authentication,” Risher says. “It’s very cumulative.” The Gray Area Googlers say that the biggest challenge in phishing defense and anti-abuse in general is handling content that may or may not be malicious. “You have to moderate your response to ensure that you’re not blocking everyone who is in this gray area,” Risher says. “It’s really important to understand the badness that’s taking place, but also to moderate that against the good activity—the regular, legitimate activity—and not go to the other extreme and end up harming the broad [Google] ecosystem.” One form of proactive defense? Notifying webmasters and email senders when they haven’t taken steps to secure and authenticate their sites and activity, or when something happens on their site that they may not know about. “It’s a rising trend for bad actors to not just create their own websites for the sole purpose of hosting malware and phishing, but to compromise others, and then leverage that hacked site to host their own content” says Safe Browsing’s Miller. Doing so lets bad actors leverage another party’s solid reputation. Google’s feedback can make webmasters and email senders aware that they’ve been compromised and that they’re unintentionally engaging in abusive behavior. ‘We have to guard every door, every window, every opening, and the bad guys just need to get through one.’ Mark Risher, Google It also wouldn’t be a Google effort without a little machine learning thrown in. Somanchi says that upwards of 95 percent of all spam and phishing identification comes from machine learning. And in the past couple of years, these Gmail mechanisms have evolved to incorporate both traditional supervised learning, in which algorithms are trained on large data sets, with newer unsupervised learning techniques, in which algorithms learn through inference about how to tell legitimate inputs from malicious ones. “Whereas regular computers are making very hard black or white decisions, deep learning opens up the possibility to be more subjective and get closer to approximating, essentially, would humans fall for this?” Risher says. Google also emphasizes that deploying machine learning also helps preserve user privacy. All that data scanning and user behavior modeling can feel plenty invasive. But Miller says that the goal is to limit access to sensitive information, keeping it siloed and therefore less vulnerable. “The systems operate on aggregated data, and the work is done without any human visibility into potentially private information,” Miller says. “We focus our attention on clustering and identifying attackers and their methods. Systems like Safe Browsing and our anti-phishing defenses identify commonalities in attack patterns.” Scams like the Google Docs phish still slip past Google’s protections. But what the anti-abuse teams learn from these types of attacks helps them prepare for next time. “When something goes wrong we really are not focused on who screwed up,” he says. “We’re looking at what changes we ought to make so this can’t happen again.” Related Video Science Phishing Scams Aren’t Just for Gullible Grandparents Anymore Phishing scams are getting more and more sophisticated, to the point where they’re fooling even security experts.

And by traditional, I mean incredibly generic. I’d be happy to write an entire manifesto on why the old gumdrops are better, but my old colleague Natt Garun already did a great job of that in this post for The Verge. Besides I recognize not everyone feels the same, so instead allow me to discuss a solution for everyone: It’s long past time Google allowed us to choose our own darn emoji. Of course, I’m not the first person to suggest this, because emoji on Android have always been an inconsistent mess. Pick two random Android devices from a crowd, and chances are they’ll have a completely different set of emoji. Regardless of what Google comes up with, some manufacturers have their own plans. Most notable is Samsung, whose emoji often give off a completely different vibe from everyone else – to the extent they can often literally change the meaning of your text. As Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia pointed out, if you try sending this message on a Samsung device… …your friends will think you’re a cannibalistic serial killer. Fortunately, most Android manufacturers have wised up and started using stock Google emoji the last few years. That’s a step forward, but it’s still a problem: Google’s own emoji have changed significantly over the years – and even moreso than usual with O. This wouldn’t be a big deal if everyone immediately updated to the latest Android version, but Android is plagued by fragmentation. Android O may technically be launching this year, but who knows how long it will be until manufacturers have caught up and most people have actually updated. Credit: Emojipedia Until that happens, people will be sending messages with no guarantee the recipient is seeing the same characters. And by the time most people are on Android O, some will have moved on to Android P, which might bring further changes. It never ends. One simple solution would be to separate new emoji packs from Android OS, so they can be updated independently. But that isn’t going to stop third party manufacturers from going their own route, nor is it going to prevent apps from using custom emoji packs. Facebook Messenger, for example, uses custom emoji to maintain consistency across devices. Snapchat uses Twitter’s Twemoji on Android devices (weirdly, Twitter doesn’t), while WhatsApp – owned by Facebook – uses Apple emoji. Yeah, it’s confusing. Even within a single Android device, the emoji experience isn’t consistent. But letting users install their own emoji can mitigate all these problems. Most users would simply receive official emoji updates from Google, while grumps like me can stick to the old blob design. If you like Messenger’s emoji, you install those. If most of your friends use iOS devices, you can keep your chats consistent across platforms. Maybe there will be new emoji packs that better reflect your personality and aesthetic choices. And you might even be able to mix and match if there are individual emoji you’re truly fond of. You could counter that allowing everyone to install whatever random emoji pack they find on the internet would just make things messier, but Google could prevent that by simply burying the option somewhere most users never access, like developer settings or the System UI tuner. It’s still better than having to root your phone. To some this whole argument might seem a little trivial, but like it or not, emoji become are becoming a bigger part of everyday conversation. They may just be tiny images on our tiny screens, but emoji help people express themselves more efficiently, convey a bit more personality, and transcend language barriers. Heck, sometimes emoji even develop a language of their own (see: 🍑). Somewhere down the line, the big companies will have to confer and figure out a way to maintain consistency across platforms – perhaps by sharing emoji packs across platforms. Until then, the least Google could do is make it easier for people to say what they really mean.

Alternatively, they’ve extracted the enormous Google wallet from the unfathomably deep Google pockets, and are cutting a check to stay ahead of their competitors. Artificial intelligence is no different. Google has several AI experiments Google's AI Breakthrough: What It Means & How It Affects You Google's AI Breakthrough: What It Means & How It Affects You Read More that you can go and play with right now. And because several of these experiments depend on machine learning, your direct interaction will actually help development. Here are some of the best Google AI Experiments that you can play with right now 5 Online AIs You Can Put to Work Right Now 5 Online AIs You Can Put to Work Right Now Artificial Intelligence are machines capable of learning, and some AIs are pretty good at learning simple tasks right now. Let's look at a few clever programs that can do everyday things for you. Read More . Please note that some of the experiments require access to a camera, either through your desktop or an Android device. 1. Thing Translator I’ve had quite a bit of fun with Thing Translator. Why? Because you can walk around your house, scanning items, listening to the instant translations into one of nine languages. It is surprisingly addictive. Thing Translator doesn’t know what everything is, but it tries to translate anything you throw at it. For some objects, it defaults to “image,” and certain spaces default to “design.” That said, Thing Translator can catch you off-guard. I took a picture of my face and received the response “hair” — pretty apt, considering my beard, but not the “face” or “boy/man” response I was expecting. Again, my kids pointed it at the rug on the floor, expecting it say “rug” or “carpet,” but Thing Translator came back with “crochet.” When you take a snap, it shows percentages of what it thought the image was, versus what it has translated. Thing Translator isn’t a 100 percent fool-proof translation device, as you’ve seen. But it would certainly help you out in a pinch, especially if you’re in a well-connected foreign country using one of the integrated languages. To use Thing Translator, you’ll need an Android smartphone with a camera, or a computer with camera. Thing Translator is currently unavailable for iOS users. Future Use Thing Translator is already in use in several places, and you can use it so long as you have an internet connection. As the algorithm learns, the precision of its translated results will increase. Expect to see it as an integrated Android feature, or at least as an app marketed at travelers. Please note that the version of Thing Translator on the Google Play Store is a rip-off of the actual product Scam Apps in the Play Store You Need to Avoid Scam Apps in the Play Store You Need to Avoid For every amazing app you can find on Android, there's a cheap knockoff waiting to waste your time and steal your money. Read More . Don’t download it — it could be a scam! 2. NSynth: Sound Maker NSynth is another slightly addictive Google AI Experiment. It is a “sound maker,” allowing you to “make unusual new sounds with machine learning.” But what does that mean? Well, you choose one sound, such as the harp, and combine it with another sound, such as a cat meowing. Yes. A harp. And a cat’s meow. Did I mention that the sounds were unusual? Below is a video of my kids and I combining sounds, so you’ll get a real picture of how NSynth works. Future Use NSynth: Sound Maker doesn’t appear to have any overarching use, except for the design of interesting new sound combinations. However, I’m not a particularly musical individual. Consequently, you might find vastly more value in this Google AI Experiment. The crazy combinations might be exactly what your band/orchestra/DJ-set has needed to push toward international stardom. 3. The Infinite Drum Machine The Infinite Drum Machine combines thousands of everyday sounds into a single, easy-to-control drum machine. The creation of this AI experiment was interesting (and ongoing). The machine learning algorithm organizes sounds, but isn’t given any descriptions or tags. Instead, it places similar sounds close together. You slide one of four markers around the various colors, with each marker providing a beat-loop for the drum machine. You can then change the sequencer to build your own drum machine, in an endless loop, with options to randomize the sounds, or adjust the tempo. Future Use I couldn’t discern any real use for NSynth. And while The Infinite Drum Machine might seem like another cacophony of noise, the organizational algorithm behind it — t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding or t-SNE — is already used in cybersecurity, cancer research, bioinformatics, and more. 4. Giorgio Cam This Google AI Experiment attempts to create a song out of the images you snap. Giorgio Cam uses image recognition to ascertain what you have taken a picture of, then turns the image labels into song lyrics. The song lyrics are then metered out over a jaunty electro-disco beat. Honestly, this is hilariously awful and engaging at the same time. Like Thing Translator, Giorgio Cam gets some image recognition completely and utterly wrong, as you’ll see in the below video. But it is a machine learning experiment, and as such, it is still learning. Future Use I’m wholly unsure. To create jaunty on-the-fly disco music while dropping fresh lyrics? I’m open to ideas on this one… 5. AI Duet AI Duet lets you play an improvised piano duet with artificial intelligence. The best bits of AI Duet are the moments where your notes and the AI’s sync, creating an exquisite harmonious moment. At least, they sound exquisite to me. Which brings me nicely onto my next point: you need absolutely no musical knowledge to have a great time with AI Duet. And that is exactly what AI Duet is about. Helping people to discover their potentially unrealized creativity through a machine learning experiment. Future Use Full musical collaborations with AI don’t seem that unrealistic. Algorithmic compositions are an established part of music. This AI interface simply brings a human-like interface and response sequence to the algorithm.

In honor of Scripps National Spelling Bee this week, Google shared the words misspelled most often across the country. We've made a few corrections to the legend. This is the one to use pic.twitter.com/0Z8fUlzmHc— GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 Google found out the most common “how to spell” searches for each state and posted them in a map. Though South Carolina has no issues spelling its beloved state dog, the Boykin spaniel, it needed help spelling “Chihuahua.” To be fair, Chihuahua – which is also a state in Mexico bordering the United States – is a fairly complex word to spell at nine letters. In a quick comparison, South Carolina appears to be doing better than its neighboring states. Georgia needed Google’s help spelling “gray,” and North Carolina couldn’t get the angle on spelling “angel.” Even though the sound of it is really quite atrocious, West Virginia and Connecticut wanted to know how to spell “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” from “Mary Poppins.” As least we’re better off than Wisconsin, which needed help spelling, well, Wisconsin. Those interested in tuning into the National Spelling Bee can watch the finals 10 a.m. Thursday on ESPN2 and then the continuing finals at 8 p.m. on ESPN. Maybe after today, all states will be searching how to spell “covfefe.” Google LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 7 days ago Raw footage: Beaufort shrimpers rescued from the "Gracie Bell" 1:32 7 days ago Raw footage: Beaufort shrimpers rescued from the "Gracie Bell" 0:52 13 days ago Not as easy as 1,2,3: How charter schools get started 0:21 2 months ago Confederates on Sea Pines Circle View More Video South Carolina Parris Island murder mystery: Who killed this 8-year-old girl in 1943?

Google already blocks 99.9 percent of spam and phishing messages from showing up in your Gmail inbox. Now, the web giant is rolling out four new Gmail security features for enterprise customers to help prevent the other 0.1 percent from making it through and tricking you into handing over your company's private information. That includes early machine learning-based phishing detection, new warnings when you click on a phishing or malware link in a message, as well as "unintended external reply warnings, and built-in defenses against new threats," Google's Senior Product Manager for counter abuse technology, Andy Wen, wrote in a Wednesday blog post. Perhaps most notably, Google is launching a new machine learning model in Gmail that "selectively delays messages … to perform rigorous phishing analysis and further protect user data from compromise," Wen wrote. Google said delay time will be "minimal" and the technology will affect less than 0.05 percent of messages, on average. Meanwhile, Gmail's new "unintended external reply warnings" also aim to help prevent data loss. "Now, if you try to respond to someone outside of your company domain, you'll receive a quick warning to make sure you intended to send that email," Wen wrote. "And because Gmail has contextual intelligence, it knows if the recipient is an existing contact or someone you interact with regularly, to avoid displaying warnings unnecessarily." Related 36 Gmail Tips That Will Help You Conquer Email 36 Gmail Tips That Will Help You Conquer Email At this point, around 50 to 70 percent of all messages that Google receives are spam, Wen said. Online miscreants last month launched a massive Google Docs phishing attack, which hit a number of journalists and individuals from other industries. Clicking a purported Google Docs button in the nefarious message took users to an actual Google page, which asked them to grant access to an app masquerading as Google Docs. Those who inadvertently granted permission gave the attacker full access to their email messages and contacts. That phishing campaign came after attackers in January targeted Gmail users with a sophisticated ploy designed to steal usernames and passwords.

Google’s payment service is now available in its 12th country, with support from a number of local retailers, apps, and banks. Nintendo Switch Google cites hundreds of thousands of stores across the country that will accept the contactless payment solution. Major names include McDonald’s, Tim Hortons, Sears Canada, and a number of phone carrier shops like TELUS and Rogers. The Canadian launch will also bring compatibility with numerous third-party apps that support payment via Android Pay, like Uber, Doordash, and several others. As usual, the app can also store gift cards, loyalty cards, and other special offers. Over the next several days, Android Pay will begin rolling out support for credit cards from Visa and MasterCard and Interac debit cards. American Express and Tangerine is listed as “coming soon.” On the bank front, the following are supported: BMO Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Banque Nationale, Scotiabank, Desjardins, President’s Choice Financial, ATB Financial, and Canadian Tire Financial Services in Canada, and prepaid Scotiabank and Desjardins cards. There is also a partnership with leading payment platforms, processors, and technology to help drive support for Android Pay in Canada. Android Pay requires an NFC-enabled device running Android 4.4 KitKat or above. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Nintendo Switch To prevent phishing attacks, like this month’s Google Docs invite scam, Gmail is using a dedicated machine learning model that selectively delays emails (less than .05 percent of messages on average) to perform rigorous phishing analysis. Integrated with Safe Browsing, a variety of techniques — like reputation and similarity analysis — will sift through for phishy and suspicious URLs. This works in conjunction with the previously announced click-time warning that redirects users before they visit phishing and malware links. In a note to administrators, Google shares that as Safe Browsing has to test the results of links, emails can be delayed up to four minutes. As such, there is a setting to manually disable it for organizations that value speed. Google notes that these machine learning models can adapt more quickly than a manual system ever could. For G Suite customers, Gmail will now display unintended external reply warnings to users to help prevent data loss when responding to someone outside of a company’s domain. These warnings are smart and will avoid popping up for existing contacts and those that you regularly interact with. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars CLOUD Google is first to offer Intel’s Skylake processors in the cloud Blair Hanley Frank@Belril May 31, 2017 11:10 AM Above: Google Cloud Platform at GDC 2016 in San Francisco. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google has become the first major cloud provider to start offering virtual machine instances using a new generation of Intel Xeon processors powered by the chipmaker’s Skylake architecture. The company launched those instances in beta a few months ago, and they’re generally available as of Wednesday. It’s a move by Google to better compete with other cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, which have yet to launch their own Skylake infrastructure products. AWS announced a set of Skylake-powered C5 instances for its Elastic Compute Cloud last year, but those have yet to launch. In addition, Google has made several other updates to its Compute Engine infrastructure-as-a-service offering. Virtual machine instances running in GCE can now support up to 64 vCPUs and 455GB of RAM. Using a drop-down menu, developers can choose their minimum preferred processor architecture for a particular Google Cloud region. The company offers a variety of Intel Xeon E5 processors, ranging from Intel’s Ivy Bridge architecture up to Skylake. As of Wednesday, developers can finally run workloads on Broadwell chips in every Google Cloud region, though not every data center within those regions support them. Skylake instances are available in three of Google’s eight cloud regions: Western US (Oregon), Western Europe (Belgium), and Eastern Asia Pacific (Taiwan). The company says that it plans additional geographic availability soon. For the first 60 days of general availability, Skylake instances will be priced the same as their older counterparts. After that, users will be charged a premium price for using them — roughly 6-10 percent above the non-Skylake price, depending on the instance configuration. Google has also lifted restrictions on how much memory can be connected to a single virtual CPU for customers who choose to customize their virtual machine instances. Customers can now elect to use as much as 455GB of memory with their VMs, no matter how many vCPUs those machines have. Previously, developers were restricted to only using 6.5GB of RAM per vCPU, which meant workloads that need a lot of memory could end up requiring more processing power than they needed. Using more than 6.5GB of RAM per vCPU will incur an extra surcharge, however.

By Kenwyn Caranna Winston-Salem Journal Kenwyn Caranna 2 hrs ago (…) Courtesy of Google Trends It seems everyone has a word or two they just can’t remember how to spell. Thus, they turn to Google to double-check it. Or, at least I do. With that in mind, Google is celebrating #spellingbee week by mapping America’s most misspelled words. The company mapped the top “how to spell” searches by state ... and managed to misspell “ninety” as “nintey,” a faux pas quickly pointed out by Twitter followers. You misspelled “ninety”— Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) May 30, 2017 And Google sent out a correction. We’ve made a few corrections to the legend. This is the one to use pic.twitter.com/0Z8fUlzmHc— GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 Google said it pulled the data from U.S. searches between Jan. 1 and April 30. After pondering Google’s state results, check out the effort taken by 290 youngsters who aren’t relying on Google at the 90th Scripps National Spelling Bee. You can test your own ability to spell using the Bee’s actual 2016 Preliminaries Test. So what word is your nemesis?

We learned more about Google’s plans for Google Home and Google Assistant, while also learning a bit more about Android O (even if we didn’t learn the actual name). To celebrate, the official Android YouTube page has published a new video showing off the highlights of what was announced at I/O, including the fact that there are now 2 billion users. Additionally, the video takes through a quick rundown of some of the most important new features coming to Android O later this Summer. Additionally, the video shows us the newly-announced Google Play Protect, which aims to help combat malware from being made available on the Play Store. The final highlight gives us a glimpse at Android Go, as Google looks to put Android in the hands of even more users, even those who can’t get access to flagship devices. Check out the video above and let us know what your favorite new feature of Android O will be. local_offer    Android  Google  Google I/O 2017   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (0) stars Further Reading DEAL: Get 4 months of Google Play Music for free Google launches Pixel photo art exhibit Mobile Roar 168: Google I/O 2017 Be careful buying a Pixel after it was purchased through Project Fi Google will be an affiliate for purchases made through Assistant videocam Top Trending Videoslaunch 1 play_circle_outline more_vertTop 5 Apps & Games - May 26 closeTop 5 Android Apps of the Week (May 26, 2017) Every week, hundreds of Android apps and games are submitted to the Play Store.

Android Pay is starting its rollout in Canada today, May 31st. Google will be adding support for top banks in Canada over the coming days, with support for more features, banks, and stores launching in the coming months. To start, Android Pay will be gaining support for eligible Visa and MasterCard credit cards from BMO Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Banque Nationale, Scotiabank, Desjardins, President’s Choice Financial, ATB Financial, and Canadian Tire Financial Services in Canada, as well as prepaid Scotiabank and Desjardins cards. Support for Interac debit cards will start rolling out on Monday, and support for American Express and cards and Tangerine will come this summer. Google is also teaming up with payment platforms, processors, and tech providers like Moneris, Bambora, Chase, Cybersource, First Data, Global Payments, Paysafe, WorldPay and Stripe. When it comes to stores, Android Pay users in Canada will be able to visit Tim Hortons, Loblaws, Petro-Canada, McDonald’s, Indigo, Pizza Pizza, Sears Canada, Telus, Rogers, and Freedom Mobile stores and use their phone to make payments. Android Pay will also be supported in apps like 1-800-Flowers, Atom, B&H, DoorDash, Fancy, Hotel Tonight, Lululemon, PayRange, Ritual, Shopify, and Uber. To use Android Pay, you’ll need an Android device that’s running 4.4 KitKat or higher and also includes NFC support. You’ll then need to install the Android Pay app from the Play Store. Android Pay is a nice feature to have, letting you leave your wallet in your pocket or purse and simply tapping your phone to a terminal to pay. Android Pay originally launched in the US in September 2015, and since then we’ve seen it expand to other places like the UK and Hong Kong. Now Android Pay is launching in Canada, and it’s good to see Google continuing to expand its mobile payment service to major parts of the globe.

[MAP] By Dave Spencer May 31, 2017 12:41 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The folks at Google have a lot of fun…especially in the Google Trends department. (Just down the hall, third door on the left.) They research everything. (Maybe TOO many things–say some–but that’s a blog for another day.) They have determined what words are the most difficult to spell by state. And, they’re only assuming these words are difficult to spell because they are the ones most searched in each state. Some of the words on the map below are, let’s face it, super easy to spell, and some are weird. Why are Arkansas and South Carolina searching “chihuahua” so much, for example? Why is “hallelujah” suddenly the hot word in Delaware and Indiana? Anyway, it’s a fun list, and Kentucky’s word seems to be the one that gives the MOST states trouble.

Paysafe Offers Android Pay in Canada Google’s Android Pay available as an in-app payment processing option for Paysafe merchants May 31, 2017 01:58 PM Eastern Daylight Time MONTREAL--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Paysafe, a leading global payments provider, announces it has teamed with Google to be one of the first Payment Service Providers (PSP) to launch in-app Android Pay capabilities to its merchants in Canada. Android Pay offers a fast, simple and secure way for shoppers to use their Android phones with the use of a digital card for purchases in-app and in-store without pulling out a physical wallet. Android Pay was built as an open platform for developers to add to mobile commerce apps. Paysafe will offer its Canadian merchants the ability to process in-app payments using Android Pay by providing them with required Application Programming interfaces (API) and a Software Development Kit (SDK) to support this function. Paysafe’s Chief Product Officer, Daniel Kornitzer said: “We are thrilled to offer our Canadian merchants value enhancing in-app Android Pay capabilities. Being among the first to work with Google on the mobile commerce front like this in Canada is greatly beneficial to our merchants and their customers. Our digital payments collaboration with Google reflects our desire to simplify payments for merchants while making in-app mobile purchases easy and secure for the consumer.” Google’s VP of Payments, Pali Bhat commented: “We’re excited to bring the simplicity and security of mobile payments to Android users in Canada with the help of companies like Paysafe. Starting today, Paysafe’s Canadian merchants will be able to provide their shoppers with the option of checking out with Android Pay through their mobile apps.” About Paysafe Paysafe provides digital payments and transaction-related solutions to businesses and consumers around the world. Paysafe is redefining payments by enabling fast, convenient and secure ways to pay before, pay now and pay later through its payment processing, digital wallets, prepaid solutions and card issuing, and acquiring products and services.

Then It Sued Uber by Mark Bergen @mhbergen More stories by Mark Bergen and Kartikay Mehrotra @KartikayM More stories by Kartikay Mehrotra May 31, 2017, 1:19 PM EDT Case prompted Uber to fire star engineer leading its efforts Meanwhile, Alphabet has been improving its own driverless tech Where Waymo Stands in the Driverless Car Space Not so long ago Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving ambitions seemed to have lost momentum despite the company being among the earliest to put experimental autonomous cars on the road. There was no business plan, and Alphabet was in danger of losing its first-mover advantage to traditional automakers and Silicon Valley startups, including Uber Technologies Inc. It looked as though the company had started another moonshot. Then Alphabet got serious.  Late last year, the company spun off the self-driving arm into its own entity, called Waymo, which this month began testing a driverless taxi service in Phoenix featuring minivans loaded with in-house technology. Waymo also pulled out a legal bazooka, suing Uber and accusing the ride-hailing company of stealing trade secrets when it acquired the autonomous vehicle startup founded by Anthony Levandowski, who previously helped run Google’s driverless arm. On Tuesday, Uber fired Levandowski because he refused to turn over allegedly stolen documents to the court. In an instant, Waymo had separated a key rival from its star engineer. Only a few months ago, critics suggested Alphabet had squandered its head-start in driverless technology. Waymo had lost several engineers -- including its original tech lead, Chris Urmson, and several people recruited by Levandowski -- and cut a deal with only one carmaker, Fiat Chrysler. The auto industry and a bevy of startups were aggressively working on driverless technology. Tesla Inc., meanwhile, was touting Autopilot. But behind the scenes, Waymo was shoring up its engineering bench and improving the technology. Since being spun out of Alphabet’s X lab in December, the division has hired aggressively, including several engineers from Terra Bella, the satellite division Google sold earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Waymo also designed new hardware that helps vehicles see their surroundings better. Another auto manufacturing deal with Honda Motor Co. is in the works, and earlier this month, Waymo announced a U.S. partnership with Uber nemesis Lyft Inc. Uber’s fortunes, meanwhile, have cratered. Executives have been leaving amid a broader culture crisis, ignited by claims of pervasive sexual harassment across the company. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to issue an internal report on this issue to the company this week. Among those who have left: Sherif Marakby, a high-profile hire from Detroit responsible for deals with carmakers at Uber’s self-driving unit. Earlier this month, he returned to Ford. Several other engineers from Uber’s self-driving program have also recently left, defecting for autonomous companies started by former Uber and Waymo roboticists, according to their LinkedIn profiles. While the first driverless cars aren’t expected on U.S. highways for five to 10 years, the emerging industry is already hotly contested. Sidelining or at least hobbling Uber would give Waymo time to shore up its position. But Uber chief Travis Kalanick is a notoriously dogged competitor, who believes his company’s very survival depends on mastering driverless technology. Uber could partner with other companies to build the tech and already has a massive global driving network in place, a key attribute for collecting driverless data. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Meanwhile, the court battle is far from over. Firing Levandowski buttresses Uber’s case that it never had access to the trade secrets he allegedly downloaded before quitting Alphabet. Uber also says it developed the underlying lidar technology without Levandowski’s input. From a legal standpoint, Uber had little choice but to push Levandowski out. Doing so shows the company is complying with a court order and not trying to shield the executive accused of stealing thousands of documents. The move also could presage some kind of legal settlement for Uber. There also remains a chance the case moves to criminal court; now that he’s no longer employed by and beholden to Uber, Levandowski could cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for immunity -- a switch that could prove detrimental to Uber. “The same way Waymo improved its position by getting Uber to cut Levandowski, Uber improved its position by distancing themselves from him,” says Jim Pooley, a Silicon Valley intellectual property lawyer who isn’t involved in the case. “This is all about risk reduction.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « AMD Introduces Threadripper at Computex | Main | HP Chooses Microsoft's Cortana for their new Smart Home Speaker Device as Revealed at Computex » May 31, 2017 The Day after the Essential 'Phone' Unveiling we take a Peek at their Patents and a Possible Future Project     Yesterday Andy Rubin's company Essential Products Inc. launched their new Essential 'Phone' with a 5.7" high-end display at 2560 x 1320 and other decent specifications. The company also launched other products like their 'Essential Home' device which is very much like an Amazon Echo device that offers the world's first 5" round display and their own digital assistant. Rubin told Mossberg last night during his Code Conference interview that he's trying to work with Google, Microsoft, Apple and Samsung so that their new home device will also work with the digital assistant of your choice so that you're not locked into only the Essential assistant.    Essential also launched a very innovative 360-degree camera that wirelessly connects to the phone. The accessory is held in place by magnets. Rubin demoed it during his Mossberg interview and it was really cool. He aimed it at the audience and then swiped the screen to see the image rotate a full 360 degrees. Nice accessory for a smartphone or future tablet.   I took some time yesterday afternoon to look up Essential's patents to see if they would reveal anything about their present line-up or possible future products – and this is primarily what this report is about.   The Essential 'Phone' Influenced by LG Display   While Rubin was at Google, he worked with LG display on the LG Nexus 4 released in 2012; the Nexus 5 in 2013; and the Nexus 5X in 2015. Yesterday I was given a tip (by 'Blinx182') that directed me to a 2016 LG Display granted design patent #3008810140000-(2016.11.08) from the South Korean patent office known as Kipris, for a smartphone design that is presented in-part below.   Without a doubt the face of the smartphone is in fact the design that Andy Rubin ran with and his connection to LG is well established. However, the backside of the granted design patent is shown to be completely blank. This is where Essential's secret sauce comes into play via U.S. patent 20170126268.   Essential's patent FIG. 3 noted above depicts various accessories that are attached to user devices that include wireless accessory buses; FIG. 4 includes front, side, rear views of a camera accessory having multiple digital cameras that are capable of capturing a substantially 360 degree field of view.   The mechanics of the face camera system is where Essential spent a lot of time on. In total we found five patents: 20170126868; 20170124377; 20170123454; 20170123453; and 20170123452.   One set of oddball patents stood out showing Essential's engineers were dreaming up an alternative camera design in the form of a pop-up camera found in patent numbers 20170126979, 20170126971 and 20170126937.   Essential Products Inc. Interested in Smart Glasses   In an interview with Wired published yesterday, Rubin mentioned Google Glass by stating that it "failed not because the tech was bad but because the world wasn't ready to wear them." Why did he bring that up? Well, because Essential is working on smart glasses, according to one of the patent filings. The patent figure from that patent is illustrated below.   Essential Product Inc's patent FIG. 5 noted above shows a dual-mode display with a camera placed underneath the display, according to one embodiment. Glasses #500 include one or more lenses #510 and # 520, one or more user facing cameras #530 and #540, and one or more environment facing cameras #550.   Essential engineers in describing the glasses note that "The one or more lenses can be prescription lenses, photosensitive lenses, sunglass-lenses, etc. Each lens in the one or more lenses includes a dual-mode display, with one or more using facing cameras placed within the dual-mode display. The one or more user facing cameras are oriented towards the user, and can track the direction of the user's gaze.   Augmented Reality comes into play with these glasses. Essential notes that "Based on the environment that the user sees, and based on the direction of the user's gaze, the processor can display an image to augment the environment around the user. For example, if the user is looking at a barcode of an item, the processor can display cheaper purchasing options of the same item."   The Essential Philosophy   And lastly, one of the interesting points that were revealed about Essential during the Mossberg interview was that Essential has a connection to a company called Playground. Rubin launched Playground, a venture capital firm where a few dozen engineers and designers at Playground Studios help startups build stuff. Rubin was telling Mossberg that Essential is willing and able to do things Apple won't.   He talked about how an idea from the Playground group, backed by venture capitalists, could make its way into the Essential product line so as to promote a new idea or concept that the big boys like Apple can't take a chance on for their products. Most of these ideas need a starting point prior to building volume / scale so that it could later be appealing to other Android OEMs to add to their smartphone line-up that might give them an advantage over Apple or Samsung.   Later in the Wired interview, Jason Keats, the company's head of product architecture, said that if the Essential 'Phone'' were to sell 50 million units in its debut quarter that they'd be totally screwed, adding that "Essential simply cannot produce that many phones. That's the point. We've gone after technologies and methods of manufacturing that aren't designed to support 50 million devices." Keats told Wired that he wants Essential to think like a high-end watchmaker, not a commodity gadget builder. (Granted, everyone says this, even the commodity gadget builders.) From the start, Essential's designers and engineers met with countless manufacturers in search of the most interesting technology and materials, especially stuff no one could produce at scale. "We're not for everybody," Keats says. "You know it's going to be a little exclusive."   Rubin admitted that of course Essential wants to scale up and be super profitable, but that for now, that's not the priority. The priority is about making cool products with unique features on an open source platform that encourages and promotes new ideas that are reviewed and promoted by the Playground group through Essential Product's platform. So while building a new brand is important, so is giving new ideas a chance to breathe, mature and become popular for Essential and other OEM's who want to adopt the new technologies.   In theory, it's a very interesting approach, though only time will tell if it's one that could survive. In a maturing market like smartphones, Rubin feels that being able to make a product stand out from those from Apple and Samsung will be welcomed by those that are real techies or those who love style and design.   That's why Essential is sticking with Android for hardware. It has the largest market share by far that could ensure that Essential Phone buyers won't miss out on their favorite apps.   At present no patents were found covering Essential's Internet of Things (IoT) OS called Ambient OS.   In the end, Essential is by no means a competitor to Apple. Oddly, if anything, Essential may be more of a threat to other venture capitalist firms. If an inventor has a great hardware idea that is struggling to get off the ground, inventors are likely going to make their pitch to Essential Products Inc. first knowing that it could find its way to market faster.   Then again, Essential has to first prove that consumers have any interest in their products and that's where the rubber meets the road. Taking the flip side of Rubin's analogy, in a maturing market, most consumers tend to stick with what's successful and backed by great service. That's going to be a huge wall for Essential to climb, especially against Apple. On that point, good luck.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Show More Well, this week certainly got off to an interesting start -- didn't it? In case you're just waking up from a holiday weekend hangover, Andy Rubin -- aka the "father of Android," the guy who co-created the platform and then headed up its development at Google until 2013 -- is back in the spotlight and ready to sell you on his shiny new company. Its first official product? Drumroll, please: It's a phone. An Android phone, in fact. The company is called Essential, and the phone is (oh yes) the Essential Phone. At first glance, the device seems custom-tailored to catch the attention of Android enthusiasts. It's made by the frickin' founder of Android, of course. But beyond that, it's being presented with a strong focus on craftsmanship and the utmost "premium" quality (the phone's made of titanium, for cryin' out loud). It doesn't have a single logo or hint of branding on its exterior. And it provides a "pure" Android interface without any bloatware or superfluous customizations -- aside from an apparent bit of sorcery that lets the status bar function with a U-shaped cutout in its center. Essential The front-facing-camera cutout -- the "flat tire" of smartphone displays? Rubin's new baby also has its own ecosystem of simple snap-on accessories -- a 360-degree camera and a charging dock, to start -- but that almost seems beside the point. The Essential Phone is being positioned as the phone for discerning technophiles -- folks who want the best tech imaginable and are willing to pay for the privilege. Oh, and about that: The Essential Phone costs 700 smackaroos (U.S. only, for now). Take it or leave it. Say what you will about the price, but there's something undeniably intriguing about the Essential Phone and its unusual selling points within the high-end Android phone realm. There's also, however, a lot about the device that we simply don't know -- and some of that information is pretty darn important. Here are six essential questions to consider as you try to wrap your noggin around this high-profile curiosity: 1. When will the Essential Phone actually be available -- and why is that info so vague as of now? Perhaps the weirdest thing about the Essential Phone's debut is that there's absolutely no specific information about when the thing will be available to buy. You can reserve the phone as of this week on Essential's website, but all that does is guarantee you the ability to buy it whenever that becomes possible. (You don't even give a credit card number right now -- just your name and contact info.) Essential's website offers no further guidance on when the phone might be available other than to say additional info will be provided at some "later date." A story published in Wired (which features interviews with Rubin and other members of the Essential team) suggests the device is "expected later this summer," but even that seems oddly noncommittal. In an interview at the Code Conference Tuesday night, meanwhile, Rubin mostly dodged a question about the phone's specific ship date. He first said only that it would ship "soon" -- then tactfully added that he wouldn't take reservations if he didn't think the phone would ship in "30 days or so." Essential The Essential Phone: essentially just vaporware as of today So why is Essential announcing the product today, taking the names of those who might be interested, but not actually taking anyone's money or saying when they'll be ready to deliver a physical product? When we see this sort of thing happen at tech trade shows, especially from a startup, the unspoken explanation is often painfully obvious to industry-watchers: The company genuinely doesn't know if or when it'll ship its product, and it's trying to gauge interest and/or attract potential new partnerships that might help bring its wares to market (think retailers, carriers, and other distributors as well as companies that might be able to assist with supply, production, and so on).  Is that what's happening here? Is Essential essentially just testing the waters, at least to some degree? Or if not, why is it putting in the effort to promote its product today when it doesn't have a concrete window for shipping and isn't even prepared to take proper preorders? The truth is that we don't know -- and that's something to think about. 2. How does Essential expect to actually sell this thing with any amount of scale? At the end of the day, Essential is a business -- and it needs to sell a certain amount of phones in order to stay afloat. And as we've seen time and time again, the U.S. smartphone market tends to be dominated by devices with multibillion-dollar marketing campaigns and close carrier/retailer partnerships. The latter, crucially, is what results in phones being readily available and prominently promoted within the stores where most Americans continue to buy their phones. (There's a reason why Samsung and Apple dominate the mobile market, y'know.) Now, Essential's team will tell you that the company's very business depends upon the fact that it isn't manufacturing on any grand level. (As the company's head of product architecture put it in Wired: "We’ve gone after technologies and methods of manufacturing that aren’t designed to support 50 million devices.") That's a fair enough point. But again: This is a business. And if Essential is going to survive, it needs to sell a decent amount of devices. So is there any meaningful market within the U.S. for a $700 unlocked phone that people have to go out of their way to find and buy? Much as many of us here might like to say yes, history suggests otherwise. Generally speaking, it's only the budget-realm players that manage to thrive within America's unlocked-phone ecosystem. (And yes, Google's Pixel phone faces a similar predicament. Remember, though, that it has Google's marketing muscle behind it -- not to mention availability and placement in both Best Buy and Verizon stores. Hardware itself is also only a tiny part of Google's overall business model, and the Pixel presents significant benefits for Google that stretch far beyond any revenue earned from each unit's sale. And even with all of those factors in mind, most estimates suggest Pixel sales have been relatively modest so far.) Rubin basically acknowledged this limitation during Tuesday's Code Conference interview, saying Essential was starting with web-only sales and would "probably make some announcements" about "both carriers and other retail distribution" channels soon. Right. Remember what we were just talking about in question #1? 3. What kind of support will Essential provide? Essential's website mentions the idea of devices "evolving" and not becoming outdated every year, but much of that spiel seems to revolve around the idea of the Essential Phone's snap-on accessories. So what's the story with the always-contentious subject of Android upgrades? Right now, Essential's making no promises or even mentions of its plans to provide updates to future Android releases (be they full OS updates, minor version bumps, or the more frequent monthly security patches). One might assume this company would make that area a priority, all considered -- but you shouldn't have to rely on assumptions when you're spending $700, especially on a phone ostensibly targeted at Android enthusiasts. As we've been reminded time and time again, software updates require a fair amount of resources -- and they often run counterproductive to most hardware manufacturers' interests. Getting them out quickly and reliably takes time, effort, and manpower. Will Essential have that available, and is it committed to providing it for the long haul? We also have to consider the other facets of post-sales support, particularly for a product that lacks any sort of physical storefront for interaction. If your device starts acting up, how easy will it be to get help? What kind of customer service experience will Essential provide for things like exchanges and returns? What about warranties? This is a small and untested company, and these are critical concerns for any potential customers. 4. Will there be any sort of enterprise angle? When it comes to mobile technology, the line between consumer and enterprise is increasingly blurry. People want to use phones they know and enjoy at work as much as they do in their own personal lives, and consequently, lots of popular consumer devices see strong demand on the enterprise front as well. With its apparent limited availability, will the Essential Phone be at all relevant for folks looking to buy for a business environment? For that matter, will the company be able to keep up with any significant amount of demand, even on the consumer front? 5. What's the ultimate end-game here? The Essential Phone runs Android, but Essential is also promoting a home assistant gadget that runs a custom operating system called Ambient OS. The info surrounding that device -- how it works, what exactly it does, when it'll ship -- is perhaps even more vague than what's known about the phone. (At the Code Conference, Rubin admitted he was "in conversations" with companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon about if and how they might allow his product to interact with their respective assistants -- something that's apparently meant to be one of the device's distinguishing features. "I'm gonna offer to support all those, and it's really up to the companies that control those ecosystems if they want to work with me," he said. Again: See question #1.) Combined with everything else, this makes you realize how little we know about what Essential's really up to in any big-picture sense. Is the goal to create a long-lasting business that serves a small but devoted niche of smartphone shoppers? Is it to use the phone as a springboard for a broader A.I.-centric business goal? Or could it even be to create an effective prototype that generates enough buzz to result in an acquisition -- a merger with some larger player that'd provide the resources Essential might need to make a meaningful impact?  Without Rubin's name attached, Essential would be difficult to take seriously Truly, anything is possible. For context, compare this fledgling effort to the tale of Nextbit -- another buzz-generating smartphone startup with unusual ideas about how Android should be approached. That company was founded by former members of Google’s Android team and a former head of design at HTC. It had a grand vision for the future of phones, with an emphasis on both bold design and clever software that claimed to improve upon the standard Android foundation. Nextbit's first phone, the Robin, received mostly favorable reviews but never seemed to achieve enough scale to make any real waves in the crowded mobile ocean. (It, too, was sold without any major marketing effort, carrier presence, or retailer partnerships -- though it was available through Amazon as well as through its company's own website.) Nextbit was bought by PC-gaming giant Razer this past January, just under a year after the Robin took flight. The company was set to remain "an independent division inside Razer," according to its founders at the time, "doing exactly what [it had] been doing all along, only bigger and better." (Co-founder Tom Moss was even more direct in an interview with CNET: "Joining up with Razer will allow us to reach much further.") It's hard not to wonder if Essential might have a similar aim in mind -- or maybe just a similar inevitability. And it's hard to deny that without Andy Rubin's name attached, Essential's vague announcement and impossible-seeming ambitions would be difficult to take seriously. I guess the ultimate question, then, is whether Rubin has what it takes to pull off the impossible -- again. I don't know about you, but I'm sure looking forward to finding out.

Name: Subject: Message: Android Pay launches in Canada today (Update: Now in Taiwan too) Canada Newsby Scott Adam Gordon6 minutes ago 8 123 13 Update: Android Pay landed in Canada only yesterday, but now it has touched down in Taiwan. The tap-and-go payment service arrives with support for two banks, CTBC and First Bank, but Google says that it will roll out to Hua Nan Bank, Shin Kong Bank and EnTie Commercial Bank soon. As with the Android Pay rollout in other locations, the service can be used in popular stores across the country, such as Barista Coffee and cama cafe.  It’s good timing from Google, with the announcement landing right in the middle of Computex 2017 in Taipei. For more on the Android Pay Taiwan launch, go here. After rolling out in the US back in September of 2015, Android Pay has now officially launched in Canada. Google made the announcement earlier today, outlining the initial banks that would support its mobile payments service. See also: PayPal’s latest update lets it play nice with Android Pay 1 week ago Android Pay will be available for ATB Financial, Banque Nationale, BMO, Canadian Tire Financial Services, CIBC, Desjardins, President’s Choice Financial, and Scotiabank. As in the US, Google is expected to roll out the Android Pay to more banks in future. The digital wallet works with Canadian Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards, as well as Interac debit cards from Monday. Google also confirmed that support for American Express and Tangerine cards would follow soon. Android Pay lets users make quick-and-easy in-store purchases without needing to enter credit card details. After downloading the app and setting it up, users can simply tap their NFC-equipped phone on compatible terminals to make payments. Android Pay is also compatible with certain apps and online services too, allowing users to complete one-tap purchases. For everything else you need to know about Android Pay, hit the link.

Has Trouble Spelling 'Ninety,' And So Does Google by Christina Sturdivant in Arts & Entertainment on May 31, 2017 1:40 pm More than others across the country, Washingtonians have asked for online help spelling the word 'ninety' this year. We shouldn't feel too bad, though, because apparently some folks at Google can't spell it either. In a tweet on Tuesday announcing its annual list of “America’s most misspelled words," the tech company spelled it as 'nintey' on its map. The good thing for us is that the numerical version of the word is commonly accepted. Google eventually corrected that mistake, among others. We've made a few corrections to the legend. This is the one to use pic.twitter.com/0Z8fUlzmHc— GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 Meanwhile, Marylanders prove they’re not that ‘special,’ while Virginians have struggled to spell ‘delicious,’ according to Google, which pulled data on the search query "how to spell" in each state (and D.C.) between January 1 and April 30. The list comes as kids are currently battling it out at the National Harbor to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee—which has become a money maker for former teen contestants who are charging up to $200 an hour to train their younger peers, according to The Washington Post. Perhaps a teen coach would benefit President Donald Trump who reportedly tweeted an incomplete sentence around 12 a.m. this morning, seemingly misspelling the word ‘coverage.’ It read: "Despite the constant negative press covfefe.” About six hours later, the post was deleted and Trump referenced it by saying: Who can figure out the true meaning of "covfefe" ??? Enjoy!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017 This year, Google’s report also points out which states fumbled words on based on size. For instance, Rhode Islanders couldn't figure out how to spell a shorter word, ‘liar’, and Georgians had trouble spelling ‘gray.’ People in 39 states have had trouble spelling words with six to 10 letters like 'vacuum,' 'patient,' 'banana,' 'priority,' and 'diamond.' According to Google, residents of Wisconsin want to learn how to spell ... 'Wisconsin.' The most common query was 'beautiful,' which has tripped up people in New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Minnesota and California. Understandably, residents of West Virginia and Connecticut couldn’t nail down Mary Poppins’ ‘supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.’ Contact the author of this article or email tips@dcist.com with further questions, comments or tips. twitter facebook reddit print google misspellings spelling spelling bee Other Interesting Stories Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. best of dcist 5 Of The Best Races To Run This June The 12 Best Burgers In D.C., Part Three Here Are Some Of The Best Ways To Spend 4/20 In D.C.

As shocking as it might be that Canada hasn’t had Android Pay until today, I think I’m more shocked that the image above from Google doesn’t feature poutine. Like, come on. It’s Canada, Google, where’s the poutine? I want poutine right now and I’m in Oregon. Missed opportunity, tbh. But yeah! Android Pay in Canada!   Google says that the top banks will have access “over the next several days” and that like in the US, they’ll continue to add more over time. To start, participating banks are “BMO Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Banque Nationale, Scotiabank, Desjardins, President’s Choice Financial, ATB Financial, and Canadian Tire Financial Services in Canada, and prepaid Scotiabank and Desjardins cards.” Also, VISA and MasterCard are supported right away with American Express and Tangerine support coming this summer. As for where you’ll be able to use Android Pay, Google thinks you’ll find “hundreds of thousands” of shops including “Tim Hortons, Loblaws, Petro-Canada, McDonald’s, Indigo, Pizza Pizza, Sears Canada and in TELUS, Rogers, and Freedom Mobile retail stores.” You’ll now find Android Pay in some of your favorite apps as well.

The company confirmed the departure Tuesday, after weeks of Levandowski remaining silent as the court attempted to make sense of what had taken place between the two companies (as well as Uber’s own internal investigation). The Waymo’s lawsuit alleges Levandowski stole proprietary information relating to their self-driving vehicles, which he then handed to Uber. In May, U.S. District Judge William Alsup stated that he believed there was evidence to suggest Uber had gained trade secrets belonging to Google and that Levandowski should be removed from his lead engineering role. However, the ride-sharing firm claims he was taken off autonomous development in April.  Uber has maintained the termination is not an admission of guilt, but the direct result of Levandowski’s unwillingness to cooperate. An internal email, acquired by The New York Times, doubles down on that position. “Over the last few months Uber has provided significant evidence to the court to demonstrate that our self-driving technology has been built independently,” Angela L. Padilla, Uber’s associate general counsel for employment and litigation, wrote in an staff email. “Over that same period, Uber has urged Anthony to fully cooperate in helping the court get to the facts and ultimately helping to prove our case.” There could also have been pressure on Uber to make an example of Levandowski after a comprehensive piece outlining the company’s most egregious activities was published in NYMag over the weekend. The article goes far beyond recent missteps by highlighting the firm’s unstable business model, unsavory corporate culture, poor treatment of drivers, needless risk-taking, and an overall negative impact on the environment — despite Uber’s attempts to brand itself as eco-friendly. Still, when you think about it, having scores of vehicles milling around a city in the hopes that an individual might eventually hail one doesn’t exactly sound like a green initiative. The NYMag piece even managed to collect loads of scathingly negative comments from former employees — including one alleging Levandowski was annoyed Tesla had the first autonomous-related fatality, as it signaled his team wasn’t pushing R&D hard enough. “I’m pissed we didn’t have the first death,” he was reported to have said. If that’s true, and Levandowski denies it, one might wonder why Uber didn’t cut him loose earlier. The company definitely doesn’t need another magnet for bad publicity hanging around its neck. This week, the company is expected to wrap up its own internal investigation over claims of sexual harassment, discrimination, and a mismanagement in payroll that shortchanged drivers millions of dollars. Uber’s board should be presented with the results by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who is leading the investigation, on Wednesday. A separate human resources investigation is also underway. Levandowski has 20 days to contest Uber’s decision if he so chooses.

Recommended Back to Top End of Comments 3 Comments on “Uber Fires Notorious Engineer After Failing to Cooperate with Investigation...” sirwired May 31st, 2017 at 1:16 pm When an employee takes the 5th in regard to conduct undertaken for the benefit of an employer, it’s not generally a good idea to keep said employee, unless, of course, you encourage your workforce to operate on the hairy edge of criminal law. (Usually stuff like this is a gray area, and is handled through civil suits.) With most companies, this would not be a difficult decision. But with Uber, I can totally see them agonizing over it, since, for them, the law for them is an inconvenience instead of a guideline. Login to reply tonycd May 31st, 2017 at 1:36 pm Based on the history of this case, Levandowski’s history and Uber’s, I personally believe this firing was transparent butt coverage on Uber’s part. They not only knew damn well what they were getting when they hired him – Google’s research – but that’s exactly why they hired him. Uber’s entire history and business plan have always been to aggressively discard both legality and morality, Every. Single. Chance. They. Get. Login to reply SCE to AUX May 31st, 2017 at 3:34 pm As I predicted, Mr Levandowski is out of a job, with Uber and Waymo left to duke it out in court. +1 to the comments by sirwired and tonycd above. Rather than this firing making Uber appear chaste, I think it actually support’s Waymo’s claims that he and Uber were involved in a conspiracy to steal its intellectual property. Perhaps Mr Levandowski’s memory will recover, and he’ll sing to the court about what *really* happened, in exchange for a plea. This is getting interesting.

By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 31, 2017 at 10:28 am | UPDATED: May 31, 2017 at 5:03 pm Google and Facebook are locking up nearly all of America’s internet advertising growth and will become even more dominant this year, as advertisers move away from TV and onto the web, according to famed tech forecaster Mary Meeker. And the migration of ad money to the web means not only future growth for Google and Facebook, but opportunities for other firms including social media companies Twitter and Snap, said Ben Bajarin, a principal analyst with San Jose market research firm Creative Strategies. “Anybody wanting to get into that space is simply going to benefit from the massive shift we’re seeing in offline dollars moving online,” Bajarin said in an interview. Meeker’s annual Internet Trends report, always hotly anticipated and closely scrutinized in Silicon Valley, gathers in one place an immense amount of data on the state of the internet, with the trajectories she charts mined for insights into technology’s future. This year Meeker, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in Menlo Park, paints a portrait of a changing tech landscape where voice plays an increasing role in our interactions with computing devices, and Google and Facebook cement their domination of digital ad dollars even as smartphone growth slows. While Google racked up 20 percent growth in digital advertising last year, Facebook’s ad-revenue growth accelerated even faster, skyrocketing 62 percent in 2016, Meeker said in her 2017 report, released Wednesday at the Code 2017 conference in Rancho Palos Verdes in southern California. The revenue domination by Silicon Valley’s two digital-ad giants comes as advertisers around the world follow users from TV to the internet. Meeker’s report included a graph showing global TV-ad spending rising less than $50 billion from 2010 through last year, while internet-ad spending shot up more than $110 billion. This year, Meeker projected, internet advertising world-wide will outstrip TV advertising for the first time. The money migration, however, does not mean the end of TV, argued Ezra Kucharz, former president of digital media at CBS and an adviser to the company. “If you’re a network that’s got great programming and highly viewed programming, the advertising’s still there,” Kucharz told this news organization, adding that even Netflix buys TV ads, and wouldn’t if it didn’t pay off. Meeker also highlighted the rapid expansion of voice computing capabilities, noting that Google’s machine learning algorithms have driven the abilities of its software to understand words to a human level of accuracy. “Voice can replace typing,” Meeker said in two of her presentation slides, one of which highlighted Google data showing that almost 70 percent of inputs to its virtual assistant are in conversational spoken language. Voice-computing evangelist Brian Roemmele said in an interview he believes computers’ language-comprehension skills will send users fleeing from keyboards. “You give this a shot, then you give it another shot, and you say, ‘Screw this, I’m never going to type again,'” Roemmele said. Bajarin, however, does not foresee the death of typing. Voice interaction will be embraced when hands aren’t free but will remain more convenient than essential, Bajarin said. Google faces a massive challenge in moving from its screen-based advertising model into a world of voice interaction. But its new “Lens” augmented-reality technology can also replace typing, Meeker said, and Roemmele sees opportunity there. Lens provides an overlay of information and potential user-services on top of imagery captured by a phone’s camera, and will give Google another avenue for making money by allowing the firm to connect users to advertisers via the information and service opportunities, Roemmele said. Meanwhile, Meeker reported, growth in global shipments of smartphones has continued to slow, increasing only 3 percent last year compared to 10 percent in 2015 and 28 percent in 2014. And the number of smartphones in use around the world grew only 12 percent in 2016, less than half the growth of 25 percent in 2015 and 37 percent in 2014. That slowdown derives from a saturated U.S. market plus connectivity and smartphone-affordability challenges in emerging markets, said Forrester analyst Frank Gillett. That puts pressure on Google and Apple to increase the use of the revenue-generating services they offer on mobile, such as Search for Google and Music for Apple. “They still have the potential to grow their revenues because other revenues can grow,” Gillett said. And for Apple, persuading people to buy a more expensive phone can mitigate against drops in shipments and active users, Gillett said. “Increasing the average selling price is one way to increase revenue even if you can’t grow units,” he said. Other highlights from Meeker: • Growth in the number of hours people spent online in the U.S. slowed slightly to 4 percent last year, after increasing 6 percent in 2015 from 4 percent in 2014. Still, people in the U.S. averaged 5.6 hours online every day. • Internet use on mobile devices took a record share of total internet hours in America in 2016, with 55 percent of online activity, compared to 52 percent in 2015 and 51 percent in 2014.     Tags:  Facebook Google Personal Technology Technology Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

But the Internet was too busy making jokes about a decidedly Trumpian typo, according to Google. Trump's climate withdrawal is expected later this week in the face of opposition from investors, who say their longterm investments could be in danger if climate change accelerates. (If you need a more thorough refresher on the 2015 agreement, check out this Fortune explainer on the Paris Climate Accord.) Yet the news that captivated the world today was "covfefe," the word that Trump apparently typed (and since deleted) shortly after midnight. According to data from Google Trends, which monitors what people search for using the company's eponymous search tool, users felt a more pressing urge to search for Trump's bewildering tweet—and not reports of a surprising policy decision. Google Trends data is often used as a proxy for general interest in a topic since it measures what terms people are typing into Google. It doesn't reveal how many people perform searches, but it does show how search terms compare to one another. In this case, it's clear that "covfefe" stole the show for four hours. It's important to note that Trump hasn't yet withdrawn from the Paris accord. He's said himself it will be a few days before he's ready to announce his decision. I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017 Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey pointed out that if the president does withdraw, the move would make the U.S. one of three countries to leave the agreement. Syria abstained because it's in the midst of a civil war. Nicaragua refused to join because the terms of the agreement do not go far enough, according to the Washington Post. If @realdonaldtrump withdraws from #ParisAgreement, the US will be 1 of only 3 countries not participating: https://t.co/vGBGPgzh9E- Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) May 31, 2017 While Google Trends data is sometimes used to quantify interest in the latest meme, celebrity dust-up or scandal instead of weightier topics and shame users for not showing more interest in weightier topics, like climate change, Teen Vogue writer Lily Herman makes an important point: Most people aren't talking about or searching for "covfefe" to the exclusion of everything else.

Google announced in a release Wednesday that Canada is now one of 12 countries where the mobile wallet is available. The contactless payment app lets users pay for goods with a tap of their phone. Once the app is downloaded, users don't need to open it — they simply have to unlock their phone to pay, and the card number is not shared with stores. If users lose their phone, they can remotely wipe it to make sure their card info stays secure. It works with eligible Visa and MasterCard cards, as well as Interac debit cards from BMO, CIBC, National Bank, Scotiabank, Desjardins, President's Choice, ATB Financial and Canadian Tire. Google says support for American Express and Tangerine is coming soon. The app also stores gift cards, and lets users pick what card they want to use before they pay for their purchase. It'll work at any store that accepts contactless payments (Google lists Tim Hortons, Loblaws and Petro-Canada as examples), as well as select online retailers. According to MONEXgroup, eight out of 10 retailers in Canada accept contactless payments and 10 per cent of transactions are contactless. Android Pay is available on Android phones running on versions 4.4 and up that are NFC-enabled. Android Pay works like a contactless credit or debit card. (Google Help/YouTube) Android Pay is launching just over one year after Apple Pay went live in Canada. Samsung Pay launched in Canada in November 2016. Google is planning a big expansion of Android Pay this year, with plans to launch in Brazil, Germany, Spain, and Taiwan, The Verge reported. Mobile payments are expected to grow rapidly over the next few years. A report from Business Insider forecasts U.S. in-store mobile payments will increase from US$75 billion this year to $503 billion in 2020. Follow HuffPost Canada on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars SECURITY Gmail enterprise users get earlier phishing detection, malicious link and external reply warnings Emil Protalinski@EPro May 31, 2017 10:01 AM Above: Gmail Image Credit: Gmail Google today announced an update to Gmail aimed at businesses. Three security features are rolling out to the email service: early phishing detection using machine learning, click-time warnings for malicious links, and unintended external reply warnings. The first two already exist for Gmail users and are now being made available to enterprises, while the last one is completely new. Gmail already uses machine learning to block spam and phishing messages from showing up in your inbox — “with over 99.9 percent accuracy,” Google claims. Early phishing detection is a dedicated machine learning model that selectively delays messages to perform rigorous phishing analysis and further protect user data from compromise. For those worried about Gmail delaying too many emails, Google is promising that “less than 0.05 percent of messages on average” will be affected and that the delay will be no more than four minutes. The detection models use Google’s Safe Browsing service, which provides lists of URLs that contain malware or phishing content to Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers, as well as to internet service providers (ISPs). By leveraging techniques such as reputation and similarity analysis on URLs, Gmail can generate new URL click-time warnings for phishing and malware links, adapting more quickly than manual systems ever could and improving over time, Google promises. Lastly, with the goal to help prevent data loss, Gmail now also displays unintended external reply warnings to users. If you try to respond to someone outside of your company domain, you will receive a quick warning to make sure you intended to send that email. Using contextual intelligence, Gmail will not display these warnings to recipients that are existing contacts or someone you interact with regularly. Gmail is also getting new built-in defenses against ransomware and polymorphic malware. Putting all of the above together, Google estimates that Gmail will now block “millions of additional emails that can harm users.” VB Recommendations Adobe launches free document scanning app for Android and iOS Kerbal Space Program has a new owner: Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two The dangers of hacking back

The Federal Communications Commission last week approved Google's application to try its new gear in four spots over the summer. The tests will take place at Nascar race events at tracks in Bristol, Tenn.; Brooklyn, Mich.; Darlington, S.C.; and Richmond, Va. The FCC approval was reported earlier by the web site LightReading. Google hasn't released many details about the trials, but the technology won't require spectrum licenses because it will operate in the 3.5 GHz band set aside by the FCC for extending Wi-Fi as part of its Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) plan. Ultimately, offering Internet connections in unlicensed bands should bring down the cost, although the new users must take care not to interfere with others already using nearby airwave bands in some locations, including military radar stations and satellite receiver stations. Google has also asked the FCC about testing the 3.5 GHz gear in 24 cities around the country. Fortune asked Google for comment and will update this story if a response is received. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. While there is no guarantee that anything will come of the tests, Google has said in previous applications that it is working towards a "secret commercially valuable plan." Google already owns Webpass, a unit of its Alphabet holding company's Fiber business, which offers Internet service to homes and businesses using licensed wireless bands. But the service only uses wireless connections to reach large businesses and apartment dwellings and then links with each customer inside the buildings via a traditional ethernet wired connection. The 3.5 GHz tests are expected to provide wireless Internet connections directly to phones or other gear. The FCC's final CBRS plan, adopted last year, made available 150 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band for sharing without licenses. Some wireless carriers like Verizon (vz) plan to extend their own networks by deploying small transmission cells that can operate in the 3.5 GHz band, while Google (googl) and others are looking at offering service separate from existing networks.

Blog We’ve seen the future of trucking … kind of autonomous trucks Entangled in a legal mess, Uber makes changes to self-driving truck venture James Jaillet | @trucknewsJJ | May 31, 2017 With legal trouble swirling around Uber’s autonomous truck venture, the company has fired Anthony Levandowski, the founder of the autonomous truck company Otto and a star engineer with Uber and, formerly, Google. The company also quietly announced last month it dropped the name Otto, as it was facing a lawsuit by a Canadian-based robotics company of the same name. Uber has folded Otto into its Advanced Technologies Group, known as Uber ATG. Levandowski’s departure from the company stems from a court order issued this month by the judge overseeing a lawsuit against Uber and Otto brought by Google and its self-driving car subsidiary Waymo. Google and Waymo allege Uber, Levandowski and Otto stole trade secrets and technology related to the development of self-driving vehicles, including autonomous trucks. Google alleges Uber’s Otto stole trade secrets to develop autonomous trucks Autonomous truck technology company Otto, who’s already performed two on-highway demonstrations of an autonomous tractor-trailer, has found itself embroiled in an ongoing court fight between ... In an order issued May 15, Judge  William Alsup ordered Uber to part ways with Levandowski, among other stipulations, saying Waymo provided compelling evidence to back up its allegations against Uber. Uber has disputed the claims, denying accusations the theft accusations brought by Waymo. Ride-sharing giant Uber says its autonomous system is “fundamentally different” from Waymo technology. Waymo says Levandowski, possibly in collusion with Uber, ripped 14,000 documents related to autonomous vehicle tech from its network before bolting to start Otto, which was later acquired by Uber for $680 million. Otto last year conducted two successful on-highway tests of its autonomous truck system. Uber, unrelated to its autonomous vehicle division, launched this month Uber Freight, a freight-matching platform aimed at small carriers and owner-operators. Uber officially enters brokerage market, launches Uber Freight platform “Uber for trucking,” long considered a freight-matching unicorn, has come to a kind of fruition, with the ride-sharing giant today unveiling Uber Freight, a matching ...

(WFLA) — If you’ve ever wondered what the most misspelled word in your state is, Google has the answer for you. On Tuesday, Google Trends tweeted a map showing “America’s Most Misspelled Words.” The company says it based its findings off the top “how to spell” searches by state. The data was collected from Jan. 1 through April 30. One of the most interesting finds is the word people in Wisconsin searched how to spell the most, which happens to be Wisconsin. The nation’s most common misspelled words (Click to enlarge Google photo) Here in Texas, the most misspelled word is “maintenance.” Some of the shortest misspelled words on the list include “liar” in Rhode Island, “gray” in Georgia and “twelve” in New Jersey. More difficult words included “pneumonia,” which was the most searched in several states, and even “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” in Connecticut and West Virginia. The map was released just in time for this year’s Scripps National Spelling Bee. The competition kicks off Wednesday with preliminary rounds. The final rounds will be held on Thursday.

Matt Rosoff | @mattrosoff 14 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Here are the most interesting factoids from Mary Meeker's annual state of the internet presentation    11 Hours Ago | 00:45 Mary Meeker, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, just delivered her annual presentation about the state of the internet. The VC and analyst raced through more than 300 slides in less than an hour, dropping a wealth of knowledge and analysis in a very short period of time. Here were some of the most startling statistics she shared. 85% of new online advertising dollars spent now go to Google and Facebook. 20% of queries on Google's mobile platform are done using voice instead of text. Retail store closings could break a 20-year record this year, as Amazon is opening new retail stores. Amazon has become a leading supplier of baby wipes and batteries. Gaming is more important than a lot of onlookers think, Meeker argued, as many trends that are all over the internet today started with gaming. For instance, emoji can be seen as an outgrowth of badges, originally introduced by Activision back in the early 1980s, and Nvidia started with a gaming focus in 1996, and is now used for artificial intelligence. Some gaming stats: There are 2.6 billion online gamers in the world, up from 100 million in 1995. The average gamer's age in the U.S. is 35 -- higher than many people think. 161 million people watch e-sports every month. India is the fastest growing economy in the world, and "consumers are winning" as the internet speeds ahead. Indian consumers spend more time on Android phones than users in any other country except China India is the leading market for Google Play downloads. 4 of the top 10 apps downloaded in India come from Facebook -- WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram. Indian consumers spend 7x as much time on their phones as they do watching TV, and 45% of that mobile time is spent on entertainment. Other topics included media disruption, China, and growing levels of U.S. debt. The full deck is embedded below. Mary Meeker's Internet Trends Report 2017 Correction: Meeker said that 85% of new dollars spent in online advertising go to Google and Facebook.

Google says its machine learning tech now blocks 99.9% of Gmail spam and phishing messages Posted 14 hours ago by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Sling TV becomes more like old TV with the addition of a traditional guide Google today said that its machine learning models can now detect spam and phishing messages with 99.9 percent accuracy. While this still means that one out of a thousand messages gets through (so Barrister Jon Price still has a decent chance of getting to inform you of that random online lottery winning of £552,000,00 you weren’t expecting), the company argues that this is a pretty good number. And I guess that’s true, given that according to Google’s own data, 50-70 percent of messages that Gmail receives are spam. These detection models also integrate with the Google Safe Browsing tools for detecting links to malicious URLs. To further improve its phishing-detection performance, Google also built a system that delays some Gmail messages for a little bit longer to perform more detailed phishing analysis. Because phishing attempts are more easily detected when you look at them in aggregate, Google will delay some of these suspicious messages to perform a deeper analysis as more data comes in over time and as its algorithms update in real time. This should only apply to about 0.05 percent of messages, though. Another new feature Google is bringing to Gmail is mostly meant to help businesses protect their data. Now, if you reply to an external email from somebody with whom you don’t regularly communicate, Google will show you a warning that asks you if you really intended to send this email. For enterprises, Google already offers a sophisticated set of filters that try to prevent this kind of unintended (and occasionally intended) data sharing, but for companies that don’t want to set this up, this new system offers at least some basic protections. Last but not least, Google is also now adding new click-time warnings that will notify users when they are about to click on a malicious link that could lead to a malware site.

Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai announced that Google’s next strategy would be transferred from „Android First to AI First” at the developer conference. Many different new technologies such as Android Auto and Google VR were shown in the Google Cloud Experience Area. Dobot Magician, a desktop robotic arm, was the only Chinese product showcased. At the Machine Learning area, Dobot Magician was implanted with Google TPU2 and TensorFlow. It successfully showed practical applications of the latest technologies in the field of image and speech recognition and machine learning. Dobot Magician was called „Candy Sorter” in this showcase.

The Dobot Magician is also able to pick objects up with its robotic arm.  Dave explained that the Dobot Magician was armed with the Google Cloud Machine Learning engine, the Inception V3 Model. It can analyze and understand human language through a speech API and can recognize things under a little camera through Visual API. Because of those APIs, Dobot Magician is able to make predictions quickly based on a model embedded in the Cloud and run in accordance with human will. Why was Dobot Magician chosen to be displayed at the event? The reason lays in the unique advantages of the product, such as opening APIs, high precision and flexibility. What’s more, there are 13 extensible interfaces on the body. It supports major communication protocols such as CAN and Ethernet as well as over 20 programming languages such as Blocky, Python, C++, Java and Lab view.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 31, 2017 12:07pm   Comments Share: MONTREAL, May 31, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Montreal Artificial Intelligence startup Keatext has been selected by Google to take part in Google Demo Day in San Francisco the 6-8 June 2017. Google Demo Day brings startups from across North America to Silicon Valley to showcase their technology in front of mentors and investors. These startups are nominated by Google for Entrepreneurs partners to exhibit the talent and innovation beyond Silicon Valley. Keatext Co-founders, CEO Dr. Narjès Boufaden and CTO Charles-Olivier Simard, will take the stage in San Francisco, CA to present a four-minute pitch for Keatext in front of Silicon Valley investors, venture capitalists, and judges selected by Google. They are hoping to raise the visibility of their AI startup to US investors to support them as they are preparing for a series A funding. Narjès Boufaden, CEO of Keatext said: "I am convinced that the cross-fertilization of ideas between the established AI investor hub in the Valley and our emerging AI academic hub in Montreal will boost the rate of technological innovation." Montreal technology hub Notman House nominated Keatext to represent Montreal at Google Demo Day after watching Keatext grow during the FounderFuel Accelerator program from Real Ventures. The timing of this nominalization is no accident. The Montreal AI startup ecosystem has been unfolding for some years now. Keatext is very much at the centre of this landscape. The evolution of Montreal as an AI hub is attributed to the activity of Yoshua Bengio, one of the fathers of deep learning. Dr. Boufaden was a student of Yoshua when she was doing her Ph.D. specializing in natural language processing with a focus on conversational language. Many local Universities have contributed to the phenomenon too. Programs like IVADO (universities, investors, startups, join players, specialized in deep learning) have worked to bridge the gap between the academic and business world by helping commercialize viable products. Keatext has been collaborating closely with IVADO to innovate using deep learning technologies for the purpose of automating language understanding in the context of customer experience management. Currently, Keatext is a growing startup with several partners selling the product all over the world. Local companies like BRP and Videotron are using the platform to understand the needs of their customers as they express it in their comments. Their mission is to empower the "Voice of Customer" with AI technology. Keatext uses deep learning applied to natural language processing to unlock the meaning behind a large volume of text customer feedback, by identifying topics that show up and interpreting the sentiment and intent behind these comments. The resulting analysis is easily accessible through a user-friendly interface, making this kind of data exploration accessible to non-specialists like managers and executives. Keatext counts on a very strong local network of investors and mentors from Ange Quebec and Ange Quebec Capital, Real Ventures and their Founder Fuel accelerator program, 500 Startups and BDC. Keatext is now preparing for a series A to expand her market and add new languages to the platform while working on innovative ways to help companies improve customer engagement. The event will be accessible to everyone via live stream. To watch Keatext pitch sign up here. You can find more information and updates on our blog. CONTACT US TO LEARN MORE

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Auto focus Clean Tech Emerging Entrepreneurs Flight Plan India File India Interior Pulse Technophile Luxe New Manager Super-smartphones possibly headed your way this year Our Bureau comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet A decade of the iPhone This year’s possible launch will mark the 10th anniversary Samsung, Google, Apple, OnePlus, Xiaomi, they’re all in the mix With new phones, the market simply can’t seem to get enough. If 2016 was a bustling year for smartphone makers, 2017 is getting even better. Samsung has already shaken the scene with the much-acclaimed S8, and we only have more to look forward to; from Samsung, as well as the other giants, like Google and Apple. We’ve curated a bunch of leaks and rumours floating on the internet to give you a peek at what can be expected: Galaxy Note 8 Six months ago, we were writing off Samsung’s whole Note line after the Note 7 went through its explosive fiasco. Despite all the bad press, the faith in Samsung is so high that people who didn’t experience problems with their handsets didn’t want to send them back. Now, refurbished Note 7s are actually going to be sold in some markets. On top of that, the Note 8 is being awaited eagerly, even though there are many months to go yet for its possible release. Android blogs are reporting rumours that the Note 8 will be the first Samsung phone to come with dual cameras. There are many other phones with such a setup but Samsung has been making great phone cameras, so this would be a good reason for photography buffs to get excited. Android Authority says there are rumours that the Note 8 will have a 12MP wide-angle lens paired with a 13MP telephoto lens and 3x optical zoom. Samsung’s Note has traditionally been even more feature-packed than the main flagship. And so the curiosity begins.Google Pixel 2 The Pixel was not as much of a success as Google might have hoped it would be. It came with an uninspiring design, several glitches, and a price customers were not at all happy with. Support and the availability of accessories has also been an issue, especially in India. But the two Pixel phones also sported a remarkable camera, extremely smooth performance and the first ever Google Assistant. Google reached out to users to crowdsource ideas on what the next Pixel should be like. Now it’s rumoured that there will be three Pixel variants coming up in big, bigger, biggest sizes. These Pixel 2, Pixel 2XL and Pixel 2XXL are rumoured to be code-named Muskie, Walleye and Taimen. Not that this tells us much. What is pretty certain is that they’ll come with Android 0 (Possibly Oreo) and will be powerful devices. Again, dual cameras are being hinted at as is a minimal-bezel screen, which of course is set to be the flavour of the day for phones now. Google’s phones are a while away yet. The HTC U 11 This new flagship from the Taiwanese tech company has just been unveiled but is yet to make its way around the world, including India. Like the earlier U Ultra, it has a shiny glossy back in interesting metallic colours. This looks dramatic but attracts smudges. With the U 11, HTC has debuted a new way of interacting with the phone and that’s by squeezing the side. The feature is called Edge Sense and it lets the user do specified things like launch the camera or trigger the Gmail app. Apparently, the squeeze has to be quite firm, so this may not end up being everyone’s favourite way of input, but an innovation is an innovation. Another interesting thing about the U 11 is that it has three whole virtual assistants to it: HTC Sense Companion, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa. You could also add Microsoft’s Cortana via its app and make a party of it. What users may look forward to on the U 11 is a greatly improved camera. And perhaps a better price this time, though it isn’t that likely. The OnePlus 5 There have been so many rumours and leaks over this device that it’s difficult to know what to believe. It does go to show the intensity of interest in this ‘flagship killer’. As ever, the OnePlus 5, successor to the OnePlus 3T, is expected to be stuffed to the gills with specs, starting with the Snapdragon 835, which will have either a 6GB or 8GB RAM to work with. A recent photo that leaked seems to show a phone that looks similar to the previous ones and the presumption is that the device will stick to a 5.5-inch format. Leaked pictures have also teased a dual vertical rear camera set for the phone, and a patterned finish on the back. On the other hand, it is also said that the front will have reduced bezels and the device will come in new colours. A 4,000mAh battery is rumoured along with Dash Charging that will improve a good 25 per cent over the previous, which was fast to begin with. The latest leaks say that it could be launched as early as June 15, and the company has also officially announced that the OnePlus 3T will be discontinued. The iPhone 8 No one knows what the 10th anniversary iPhone will really be called and how many variants there will be (three are rumoured, with one extra large) but despite the fact that a possible launch is half a year away, the rumour mill is churning with purported sightings of components, etc. Fans are also publishing iPhone 8 concepts in the hope that Apple will pick up something from them. One long-standing rumour has it that the iPhone’s screen will be using the OLED technology that Apple has shunned so far and will be edge to edge with curved edges — if that sounds familiar, it’s something similar to the infinity Display on Samsung’s S8 smartphones. In fact, Samsung would have to be the supplier for this. Other reports also say that the latest iPhone will have a tall 18.5:9 aspect ratio; again, like the Samsung S8. The new iPhone is said to be finally coming with wireless charging and something interesting is happening to the cameras, which are now differently arranged on one of the three editions. It’s said that two iPhones, a 7s and 7s Plus will come with evolutionary changes but the iPhone 8 will be the one with bigger changes — and it will be expensive.Xiaomi Mi 6 Already launched in China with no official date set for an India release, the Mi 6 is being awaited because it’s packed with everything. It’s a 5.14-inch device, which promises to be a handy size, and it’s running on the Snapdragon 835 processor. The Mi 6 is busy selling out within minutes in flash sales in China. A ceramic edition is particularly hot-selling. It’s on the latest version of Android and has 6GB of RAM and 128GB by way of storage — non-expandable. The dual camera set features 12MP sensors with a wide angle lens and a zoom. The front camera is an 8MP. With the camera significantly made more capable, Xiaomi will up its game in a fiercely competitive market. The main Mi 6 is all glass and metal and has a Full HD display. A 3,350mAh battery, splash resistance and dual speakers only add to the smartphone’s desirability.

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work? Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below. Latest news 31/05/2017: Uber has fired Anthony Levandowski after the engineer failed to cooperate in the ongoing lawsuit with Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Uber general counsel Salle Yoo outlined in Levandowski's termination letter, dated 26 May, that his failure to comply with a court order is the reason for his firing. In the letter Yoo also wrote that "your failure impeded Uber's internal investigation and defense of the lawsuit". A federal judge in the ongoing court case between Uber and Alphabet's self-driving car firm, Waymo, granted a preliminary injunction against Uber on 12 May that led the ride-hailing firm to remove Levandowski from any work on Lidar, and to return any stolen documents to Waymo. Levandowski is accused of downloading 14,000 confidential files before leaving Google's self-driving division in 2016. He went on to start his own self-driving truck company called Otto, which Uber bought in August 2016, six months after he had left his previous employer. Yoo goes on to underline that Uber required the engineer to have "destroyed all property and confidential information belonging to any prior employer" and by not complying with the court order it's a potential breach and warranty in the employment agreement and an "additional ground for termination". Levandowski invoked the fifth amendment in order to not to incriminate himself and refused to hand over documents or answer questions during a deposition. Uber has insisted its technology is different to Waymo's and there is no evidence it has the stolen files on its servers, although it did not check Lewandowski's computer in its search. 19/05/2017: Uber has reportedly threatened to fire Anthony Levandowski amidst a potentially damaging court case involving the possible theft of a rival's trade secrets. The ride-sharing firm is currently embroiled in a legal battle which centers around Levandowski's departure from Waymo, Google's autonomous vehicle division. Waymo claims that when he left the company, Levandowski also exfiltrated over 14,000 documents containing trade secrets which Uber subsequently benefitted from. Levandowski, while not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, has been barred by presiding Judge William Alsup from working on Lidar technology - the technology covered by the allegedly stolen documents. Waymo also wanted to block Uber's driverless car research altogether, but this request was not granted. Alsup has, however, referred the case to criminal prosecutors, which could spell trouble for the company. "Waymo has supplied a compelling record that Levandowski pilfered over 14,000 files from Waymo, and that Uber knew or should have known as much when it brought him on board," Alsup wrote. Throughout the case, Levandowski has made use of his fifth-amendment right to not incriminate himself, and has thus far refused to testify. Now, however, Uber's lawyers have handed him an ultimatum. According to Levandowski's lawyers, Uber's general counsel Salle Yoo told the executive in a letter that he was expected to either deny the charges, or to hand over the purloined files immediately. If he does not, the letter states, the company will take "adverse employment action" against him, which may result in his termination from the company. Referring to the Judge's order to do everything it can to compel Levandowski to produce the documents, Yoo's letter apparently read: "Uber takes its obligations under the Order very seriously, intends to comply fully, and expects you to do the same". Levandowksi's lawyers, however, are arguing that this is unconstitutional. They claim that the court is giving Uber no choice but to fire him unless he violates his fifth-amendment rights. "It is an act by the judicial branch of our federal government compelling an individual to choose between preserving his livelihood and preserving his constitutional rights," Levandowski's legal team wrote in the court filings. "Nearly fifty years of Supreme Court precedent forbid the government from putting an individual to such an unconstitutionally coercive choice," it said. "The Hobson's Choice that Mr. Levandowski now faces is a direct product of government action." 15/05/2017:  Waymo and Lyft are coming together to work on self-driving cars, in a bid to challenge rival Uber. The Google-owned autonomous vehicle firm will be partnering with Uber's main business rival in a non-exclusive deal that aims to bring driverless taxis to market before Uber. According to a Reuters source, talks on the deal began last summer. Uber has notably clashed with both companies. It is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Waymo after being accused of poaching one of its executives, who allegedly brought 14,000 confidential documents with him. Lyft has predominantly been exploring autonomous technology through partnerships, such as a $500 million investment deal with General Motors that will see the two companies work together on similar tech. Lyft says that this new agreement will not affect its relationship with GM. 12/05/2017: A US judge has called for an immediate investigation into the allegations of stolen trade secrets, which have surfaced during a court battle between Uber and Google over self-driving car technology. Google initially filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app in February, which alleged that former engineer Anthony Levandowksi downloaded 14,000 files without authorisation while working on its self-driving car research. Levandowski is said to have then left Google's Waymo to found his own startup, Otto, which was then later purchased by Uber for $680 million. Google claims that the documents travelled with him, which Uber then used to fast track its own autonomous vehicle research. US District Judge William Alsup stated in a ruling that the case "contains ample evidence" to merit an investigation, and has forwarded a recommendation to the US attorney "based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation". "The Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney," the order states. Alsup also partially granted Google's bid to force an injunction against Uber's self-driving car unit, which if successful could determine the future of the company's operations in the technology. This ruling, which could be decided as early as tomorrow, has been made under temporary seal, so the exact scope of the injunction is unclear. The case has been complicated somewhat by Levandowski, who has invoked his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination and refuses to testify, leaving the two companies to fight it out in court. A spokesperson for Uber said in an email to IT Pro: "It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make. We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum". The company also said it would not be commenting on the case referral to the US Attorney, but stated that the result of the partial preliminary injunction, currently under seal, would most likely be "status quo". Uber initially argued that Waymo's trade secret allegations should be held in private arbitration, however because Levandowski is not a defendant, Uber could not use his arbitration agreement with Waymo to force the proceedings behind closed doors, and as such was rejected by the judge. Uber doesn't dispute the claim that Levandowski stole the documents in question, but argues that trade secrets never made their way into the company's research, and that Google needs to prove that Uber "derived its knowledge from Levandowski". 28/04/2017: Uber self-driving car boss steps down amid Waymo lawsuit Uber's self-driving car chief has left his position after allegations that he stole critical research from his former employers at Waymo, Alphabet's own driverless car unit. Anthony Levandowski will continue to work for Uber, according to an internal memo published by Business Insider, but will no longer head up the company's Advanced Technologies Group or manage its work on autonomous vehicles. "Travis and I have decided that I will be recused from all LiDAR-related work and management at Uber, through the remainder of the Waymo litigation," Levandowski wrote in an email to staff. "This change means that Eric Meyhofer will be the head of ATG, reporting to Travis, and I will report to Eric. My other responsibilities will not change." "This organizational change means I will have absolutely no oversight over or input into our LiDAR work. Going forward, please make sure not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic." Levandowski's departure comes amid allegations from his former employers, Waymo. The Alphabet-owned self-driving car company claims that when he left to join Uber, Levandowski took vital technology and information on the company's research and development efforts with him. For Uber's part, it claims that its work is "fundamentally different" to Waymo's and that Levandowski's role was focused on management rather than engineering. As part of the ongoing case, the presiding judge has asked the company to provide details of Levandowski's role, which could result in an injunction stopping Lewandowski from working on Uber's autonomous vehicle programme altogether. Uber declined to comment, but referred IT Pro to the email published by Business Insider. 26/04/2017: Leading US carmakers have petitioned the state of California to revise its proposed regulations on autonomous vehicle testing, stating that authorities ignored their earlier concerns that the rules would become too restrictive. Self-driving car manufacturers raised their objections at a public hearing in Sacramento on Tuesday, the recording of which was seen by Reuters, saying that the planned additional regulations should be dropped, and that oversight should be handed to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) instead. In the consultation, hosted via a webcast, automaker groups including the Association of Global Automakers described the proposed regulations as going "too far". The group also opposes California's plans to introduce a permit system, which would be required by all automakers wishing to test self-driving cars in the state. Ride-hailing firm Uber was driven out of San Francisco last year after it refused to apply for a permit to test its autonomous vehicle fleet. Automakers now believe requiring a permit is no longer an effective approach to regulating tests, and object to the proposal that the state could revoke permissions even if a company adheres to federal requirements. If the proposals were to be accepted, the automakers would be liable for any crashes that occur during the tests, even if they were not to blame. General Motors official Paul Hemmersbaugh said that regulations like these could have a "chilling effect on testing and deployment of self-driving cars". It could also see the introduction of a scheme that would ask automakers to submit a voluntary assessment to the NHTSA, outlining specific details of their self-driving vehicle systems. However, according to lawyers representing Google, Ford, and Uber, this would effectively be a mandatory clause. Other self-driving manufacturers, including Alphabet's Waymo and Ford, asked California to relax current regulations that restrict the testing of vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, which would include rides with multiple passengers. However safety advocates believe harsher regulations would ensure the public is kept safe from potential accidents. Group president for the Consumers for Auto Reliability, Rosemary Shahan, said: "We do not trust the auto manufacturers or the tech industry to protect the public in the absence of federal motors vehicle safety standards." Alphabet's Ron Medford urged the state to quickly issue definitive guidelines "to provide manufacturers with the certainty that they need", although it is clear that lawmakers are still unsure how best to regulate the emerging technology. 24/04/2017: UK tech firms today received funding to test self-driving cars on Britain's roads, reaping the benefits of a recent government pledge to back the development of emerging technologies. Two consortiums have already secured backing as part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, a government commitment announced on Friday set to invest almost £5 billion into research and development over the next four years. Streetwise, a group led by Cambridge-based AI startup firm FiveAI, is currently working on a trial that will allow commuters to order self-driving cars using a mobile app. This will include the development of new insurance and safety protocols governing the use of the technology. The trial, which is set to launch in 2019, has received £12.8 million in government support and will be developed with input from Direct Line, Transport for London, the Transport Research Laboratory, and the University of Oxford. "It's about delivering to the consumer an autonomous Uber-type service in London," said FiveAI CEO Stan Boland, speaking to the Telegraph. "It's insane for people to buy a car and the leave it parked for 94% of the time and only have one user per car, in the future vehicles can be shared." Driverless shuttle tests are already underway in Greenwich Driven, an initiative led by Oxbotica that has received £8.6 million in government funding, aims to develop self-driving technology over the course of a 30-month programme that started in April, aimed at linking London and Oxford with an autonomous shuttle. Commuters are able to test the technology today on the streets of Greenwich. Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith said: "Today’s news is truly ground-breaking. No company, group or consortium of autonomy experts has ever attempted what DRIVEN is planning over the next 30-months.We are seeking to address some of the most fundamental challenges preventing the future commercial deployment of fully autonomous vehicles. I have full confidence in Driven’s world-leading and internationally respected team of specialists to deliver this project." Telefonica, the UK Atomic Energy Authority's R&D lab Race, UK domain registry firm Nominet, Oxford Robotics Institute, and Oxfordshire Council, will join Oxbotica in the consortium, as well as the Transport Research Laboratory, which is also supporting FiveAI. The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is the latest government initiative to foster development of some emerging technology innovations, and offer alternate ways for commuters to travel to and from the capital. Speaking alongside the announcement, business and energy secretary Greg Clark said: "As part of our Plan for Britain this government wants to create a modern Industrial Strategy to support the key sectors of our economy and spread jobs, prosperity and opportunity around the whole country." "The funding I am announcing today, providing hundreds of millions of pounds of support to develop the next generation of technologies across a range of sectors, shows our determination and commitment to making sure the UK remains at the very forefront of research and innovation." Picture courtesy of The Gateway Project 19/04/2017: Baidu to open its autonomous driving platform Chinese tech giant Baidu has announced it's to provide an open software platform beginning in July for the automotive and autonomous driving industry to help develop autonomous driving systems. Baidu stated it wants to "build a collaborative ecosystem, utilising its strengths in artificial intelligence (AI) technology to work together with other companies to promote the development and popularisation of autonomous driving technology". The initiative has been named Project Apollo after the US' lunar landing programme, as the company believes autonomous driving has the same potential to change the world as its namesake did. Apollo will include a vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services. The company is planning to open source obstacle perception code and capabilities, trajectory planning, vehicle control, and vehicle operating systems, as well as testing tools. Baidu President and CEO Qi Lu said: "AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles." The company is also going to set up  alliances with partners "who will provide the best and most compatible vehicles, sensors, and other components, to achieve broad participation and collaboration and to provide references and recommendations to participants of a rapidly expanding ecosystem enabled by Project Apollo". It hopes that this will make it easier and more efficient to research and develop self driving car technology. Baidu will restrictively open its technology in July and then open it fully towards the end of the year. It also plans to introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020. 05/04/2017: A recent disengagement report from Alphabet's Waymo shows that the company's driverless cars are some of the most reliable in the self-driving industry. According to the report, Waymo's autonomous vehicles drove 635,868 cumulative miles over the past year and had 124 disengagements, which are defined as instances where a human needed to take over driving. This means that these vehicles only experienced roughly one disengagement every 5,128 miles. When compared to the competition, results indicated that Waymo's vehicles are significantly more reliable at this point. While Ford only reported three disengagements over the past year, their autonomous vehicles only traveled 590 cumulative miles - a fraction what Waymo's vehicles have completed. BMW didn't fare much better, reporting one disengagement over 638 miles. Despite Waymo's proven reliability, the self-driving company doesn't stack up to the rest of the competition in terms of overall progress. Navigant Research's leaderboard report on autonomous driving suggests that Waymo is ranked seventh on a list of top 10 vendors. BMW and Ford, whose disengagement reports fared worse results, both top Waymo on the list, with Ford considered the number one vendor. The report rated these self-driving industry players in ten categories: vision, go-to market strategy, partners, production strategy, technology, product capability, product quality and reliability, product portfolio, staying power, and sales, marketing and distribution. While the rankings show that Waymo features the most advanced technology, the report found that the company has no production capacity or production deals. 28/03/2017: Uber's San Francisco-based driverless car trials are back online following a short pause after one of its vehicles crashed in Arizona last week. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” an Uber spokeswoman told TechCrunch yesterday morning. However, its Arizona and Pittsburgh-based trials will remain grounded until the company can investigate properly what went wrong when another car allegedly ploughed into the automated vehicle, knocking it over. Although Uber's cars can be driven without a driver, they all have manual controls built in too, so a human can take over when required. It would seem there was not enough time for the driver to take over and avoid the accident in Arizona, although it's still under investigation. TechCrunch explained that the cars used in the taxi firm's Californian trials are newer and therefore safer to drive. It's thought the trials in Pittsburgh and Arizona will resume ometime in the future, but Uber hasn't said when it's likely to happen yet. 27/03/2017: One of Uber's driverless vehicles has crashed during testing in the US, the company has confirmed. Pictures and a video of the incident were distributed on Twitter via @FrescoNews, where the source explained the accident happened in Tempe, Arizona, and no one was injured during the crash. "BREAKING: Self-driving Uber vehicle on it’s side after a collision in Tempe, AZ. Photos by @fresconews user Mark Beach," the news site said, followed by: "#UPDATE: No injuries yet reported in an accident involving a self-driving #uber, captured by @fresconews user Mark Beach in Tempe, AZ." Another source, local newspaper ABC15, said a normal passenger-operated car didn't stop for the automated vehicle and hit it. Uber's self-driving SUV fell on its side, witnesses said, and the driver of the manned car was given a talking to by police. There was a human behind the wheel and although initial reports said there was someone in the back of the autonomous car, Uber later said this wasn't the case. “We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle," Uber confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. Uber has since paused its driverless cars trial programme in Arizona, but the company hasn't said how long for or whether schemes in other parts of the US have ground to a halt too. This is the second incident an Uber self-driving car has been involved in. The previous crash happened in California last December, when one of its vehicles failed to stop at a red light. 15/03/2017:  Intel has announced a $15.3 billion (£12.5 billion) proposal to acquire Jerusalem-based technology firm Mobileye, developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. The two companies have been collaborating alongside BMW since last year on a project aiming to produce driverless cars by 2021. Mobileye makes software and camera sensors for driverless cars, selling to companies such as General Motors, Nissan, and Hyundai. Intel said the acquisition expands its strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that strengthen the company’s computing and connectivity capabilities.  According to Intel, the driverless technology market could be worth up to $70 billion by 2030, and the acquisition of Mobileye gives it a major boost in the autonomous driving race. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” said Mobileye CEO, President and Co-Founder, Ziv Aviram. He explained that by merging the infrastructure and resources of the two companies, their combined knowledge in areas like virtual driving, simulators, and hardware can be enhanced. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry,” Aviram added. The acquisition is not only a step-up for Intel, but it’s also groundbreaking for the Israeli tech industry. The deal marks the largest-ever purchase of high-tech Israeli technology, significantly surpassing the previous record-holding deal of $4.7 billion paid by Lucent Technologies for Chromatis Networks in 2000. 14/03/2017: California's Department of Motor Vehicles has revealed it is looking at allowing driverless car manufacturers to test their vehicles without a human driver in the front seat. "Since the adoption of the current testing regulations, the capabilities of autonomous technology has proceeded to the point where manufacturers have developed systems that re capable of operating without the presence of a driver inside the vehicle," the proposal explained. "The department is amending Article 3.7 to include the testing of vehicles that do not require the presence of a driver inside the vehicle and ensure the testing of such vehicles is conducted on California public roads in a safe manner." Companies wanting to trial their cars without a driver inside must apply for a new type of licence -  Manufacturer's Testing Permit -Driverless Vehicles. The governmental organisation said it has changed its view towards autonomous vehicles to promote the development of autonomous technology that will lead to safer driving practices, it explained. "These rules expand our existing autonomous vehicle testing programme to include testing vehicles where no driver is present," said Jean Shiomoto, director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. "This is the next step in eventually allowing driverless autonomous vehicles on California roadways." The department has invited the public to out forward their arguments for and against allowing such vehicles to be tested on the road, minus a driver. Written comments can be submitted until 24 April. 03/03/2017: After being driven out of San Francisco for failing to secure a testing permit, Uber has announced it will now cooperate with California regulators as it seeks to restart its driverless car trials in the state. California's Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed to Reuters that it had held discussions with Uber to assist the application process for a self-driving permit, something that Uber originally claimed was unnecessary. Uber launched its self-driving pilot programme in San Francisco last December without state permission, arguing that because its cars were not fully autonomous and required "active physical control or monitoring", they did not meet state requirements for the $150 permit. The state DMV, however, disagreed, arguing that not only did Uber fail to seek the correct permits, but also failed to properly mark their fleet as test vehicles. It also pointed to the number of other companies operating self-driving cars in the state, including Google, Tesla and Ford, who had all correctly secured testing permits. As a result, the DMV revoked the registrations of 16 Uber vehicles, only one week into the trial, with the threat of further legal action if they continued to test. Uber has since relocated those test vehicles to Arizona, where the company has received a warm welcome from Republican state governor Doug Ducey, but has reapplied for permission to test vehicles in California. An Uber spokesperson said in a statement to IT Pro: "These cars are legally registered and are being driven manually. We are taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit. As we said in December, Uber remains 100% committed to California." It comes just says after the firm's CEO, Travis Kalanick, said he needed to "grow up" and seek leadership advice. 24/02/2017: Alphabet's Waymo — Google's self-driving car project — has sued Uber, accusing it of stealing 14,000 files to copy its sensing tech. Waymo said Uber and the autonomous trucking firm Otto, which Uber bought last year, had stolen plans for Waymo's Lidar, a laser based sensing technology. The complaint filed in California said: "Uber's Lidar technology is actually Waymo's Lidar technology." Lidar bounces light off objects to "see" where they are — it's not a new technology, but Waymo's version is reportedly a tenth of the price of existing systems, according to Reuters. "Hundreds of Waymo engineers have spent thousands of hours, and our company has invested millions of dollars to design a highly specialised and unique Lidar system," the company said in a post on Medium. "Waymo engineers have driven down the cost of Lidar dramatically even as we’ve improved the quality and reliability of its performance. The configuration and specifications of our Lidar sensors are unique to Waymo. Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company." Waymo said building the technology has taken seven years, while Uber's Otto appears to have done the same over nine months. The accusations centre on Anthony Levandowski, the founder of self-driving truck firm Otto, which hit the roads last year by shipping a lorry-load of Budweiser beer. In August, Uber bought the company. Before founding Otto, Levandowski worked on Google's self-driving project, now dubbed Waymo. It alleges that he downloaded 14,000 files before he resigned in January 2016 — including Lidar designs. "To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop," the Waymo blog post alleges. "Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints." Waymo said it spotted the knockoff design via an email slip-up. "Recently, we received an unexpected email," the company said. "One of our suppliers specialising in Lidar components sent us an attachment (apparently inadvertently) of machine drawings of what was purported to be Uber’s Lidar circuit board  —  except its design bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique Lidar design." Uber said it took the allegations "seriously" and would "review this matter carefully". Waymo is seeking unspecified damages, but asked for Uber to be banned from using the Lidar information. "Competition in the self-driving space is a good thing; it pushes everyone to develop better, safer and more affordable technology," Waymo said in the blog post. "But we believe that competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions." It's not the first legal battle in the self-driving arena: in January, Tesla sued a former director of its Autopilot automation project for poaching its staff. 22/02/2017: Just over two months to the day after being kicked out of San Francisco, Uber has begun trials of its self-driving fleet in Arizona, this time with the permission of the state's authorities.  Self-driving Ubers are hitting the road in the Grand Canyon State. pic.twitter.com/tOgiw4GD1d — Uber (@Uber) February 21, 2017 Arizona Republican governor Doug Ducey is expected to be 'Rider Zero' on the latest trial for the autonomous ride-hailing service, which is available to residents of Tempe starting today Uber's previous test of 16 self-driving cars in California in December was met with opposition from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which claimed the company failed to apply for the correct test permits. Uber always maintained that because a human was always behind the wheel, the cars did not fit the criteria for the $150 permit. It appears, however, that Arizona has taken an entirely different approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles. In August 2015, Ducey signed an executive order in support of the development of self-driving technology, urging authorities to "undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles" on roads within Arizona. AZ Gov @dougducey taking a ride in @Uber_AZ's new self driving car. Pretty slick looking machine! pic.twitter.com/1zFoDNYUKV — Ty Brennan (@TyFox10) February 21, 2017 Customers in Tempe are now able to hail a self-driving Volvo XC90 SUV on the Uber service, which will be overseen by two Uber engineers in the front seats, in case a situation arises that requires human intervention. This signifies a much needed win for Uber given a series of bad press reports over the past few months. Aside from the controversy in California, the technology is far from perfect and has been caught running red lights, as well as narrowly avoiding a collision in San Francisco. The company itself has come under fire this week, with claims of rampant sexism from a former Uber engineer. Uber has said it plans to expand testing to other cities in Arizona within the next few weeks. 17/02/2017: Google patents car that 'prevents harm' in accidents Google has patented a technology that could prevent injuries in the event of an accident. The company has filed a patent with the US patent office for "adjusting a shear pin to minimize an impact force felt by an object in a collision with a vehicle". This means its self-driving cars' computers could analyse the amount of force needed to prevent injury or damage to the person, animal or object it's about the crash into. “Computing devices within a vehicle may determine that an impact with an object cannot be avoided by way of braking, steering, and/or accelerating the vehicle,” the patent explained. “When this is the case, the computing devices may work to adjust the amount of force necessary to break one or more shear pins which are holding a panel of the vehicle in place. The force of impact on the object which the vehicle collides may be reduced, thereby limiting the severity of injuries and/or damage to the object.” The computer device inside an autonomous car would receive data that it is about to collide with an object and the shear pin, which determines what will happen to a vehicle when it is subjected to pressure, would move into a position that would cause it to break, meaning the car's panels would slide back and absorb the impact. “The characteristics of the object with which impact is imminent may be used to determine to adjust the amount of shear force necessary to break the one or more shear pins, in an effort to minimize the impact force felt by the object,” the patent said. “The size of an object may be used to estimate its mass. This in turn may be used to determine the appropriate amount of shear force for the shear pins.” Google's automated car company, Waymo, hasn't revealed whether the technology will be integrated into its cars or if it will license the technology to other automated car makers. 16/02/2017: Microsoft India has just announced a partnership deal with India's Tata Motors, collaborating on technologies designed to make driving a more personalised experience. The new partnership will focus around AI, IoT and machine learning technologies, and will provide Tata vehicles with advanced telematics, remote monitoring and sophisticated navigation technologies. The first vehicle produced as part of the new agreement will be shown off at the Geneva International Motor Show on 7 March. The company wants to create "a highly personalised, smart and safer driving experience across the digital life of a vehicle owner", according to Tata Motors managing director, Guenter Butschek. "In the first phase, the advanced offerings will incorporate technologies such as cloud computing, analytics, geo-spatial and mapping and increased human-machine interface, creating a new benchmark in the industry for connected vehicles," he said. "Using the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, we will provide the vehicle owners here as well as across the world a safe, productive and fun-driving experience," said Microsoft India's president, Anant Maheshwari, adding that Microsoft expects 90% of cars to be completely connected within three years. 13/02/2017: Ford is to invest $1 billion dollars into an AI startup over the next five years, comprised of ex-Google and Uber engineers who have worked on autonomous car projects. Argo AI will be led by CEO Bryan Salesky, formerly of Google, and Uber's Peter Rander as company COO, both of whom were leaders of their companies' self-driving car teams. The organisation, based at Ford's Pittsburgh headquarters, is expected to have more than 200 members by the end of the year. This represents the latest push by a car manufacturer into autonomous technology, which has become a highly competitive market over the past few years. Audi, Nissan, Tesla, and even companies traditionally not associated with vehicles, such as graphics processing firm Nvidia, are working on their own technology. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford CEO Mark Fields. "We believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term, and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The deal will see Ford focus on its development of vehicle hardware, including the exterior and interior design of autonomous cars, and the integration of new systems. Argo AI will latch onto Ford's current software development teams and help the company scale up its production. If all goes to plan, Ford intends to have a fully autonomous, level 4-capable vehicle for the commercial market by 2021. This, according to the Society of Automated Engineers (SAE), is one rank behind "fully autonomous", in which the AI is able to fully control every aspect of the driving and does not rely on the input of a human driver. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky, Argo AI's CEO. "We believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." Although Argo AI will initially focus on supporting the production of Ford vehicles, the company has stated that future plans could include the licensing out of its technology to other firms wishing to move into the autonomous sector.

The Department for Transport is set to unveil plans for the two-in-one policy as it attempts to reduce the legal hurdles preventing self-driving cars from hitting the road in the UK. Who would ultimately be responsible for the cause of a driverless accident has been the cause of significant debate for legal bodies across the world. The latest plans will introduce policies that cover drivers while they are at the wheel, and then allows responsibility to be handed over to AI while in driverless mode. Claims made against accidents involving AI will be covered by the insurance company who will recuperate losses from the party responsible, which may include the car manufacturer. The government hopes this will make it easier for victims of crashes involving driverless vehicles to access compensation. "Automated vehicles have the potential to transform our roads in the future and make them even safer and easier to use, as well as promising new mobility for those who cannot drive," said transport secretary Chris Grayling, in a statement to the Telegraph. "But we must ensure the public is protected in the event of an incident and this week we are introducing the framework to allow insurance for these new technologies." Accidents involving driverless cars have raised questions as to who exactly is to blame for a crash. In June last year a driver was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer after failing to break. But the government is keen to encourage the growth of the driverless car industry in the UK, an industry analysts predict will be worth almost $42 billion globally by 2025. Ian Crowder, head of public relations at AA, argued that although improving policies will make insurance claims more streamlined, there is no way to predict how other human drivers will respond to an increase in driverless vehicles.  "In the longer term the number of claims should dramatically fall," said Crowder. "However there are concerns relating to the behaviour of drivers of human-driven cars mixing with autonomous vehicles, which could lead to an increase in collisions." "For example, frustration at autonomous vehicles sticking to the speed limit; human drivers attempting to fit into smaller spaces between autonomous vehicles etc... which could lead to an increased number of collisions so that could lead in turn, to an increase in premiums overall," added Crowder. Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is expected to go ahead with its plans to test driverless cars on the streets of London later this month, following successful preliminary tests in Milton Keynes last year. 01/02/2017: A deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz will see its range of vehicles join Uber's ever-expanding fleet of self-driving cars. The partnership will see Germany's Daimler join forces with the popular ride-hailing service to introduce and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. "Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars," said Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. "This became very clear to me after I visited an auto manufacturing plant and saw how much effort goes into designing, testing and building cars." "That's why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world," he added. "We can combine Uber's global ridesharing network with the world-class vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities." Uber has so far declined to offer the financial details of the new deal, however Daimler represents the first company to take advantage of Uber's new policy allowing third-party manufacturers to add their own self-driving cars. As a result of a $300 million deal with automaker Volvo, vehicles have already been piloted in Pennsylvania and Arizona using self-driving kits developed by Uber. However unlike previous deals, Uber will not own or manage the new fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, or be responsible for the research and development of the AI led software. Instead, Uber has simply added the Daimler manufactured cars to its self-driving vehicle range. 20/01/2017: Tesla semi-autonomous cars won't be recalled in US Tesla semiautonomous cars won't be recalled in the US, despite the technology inside one of its cars resulting in the death of a customer. Joshua Brown was killed when the Tesla he was driving collided with a lorry in May 2016. However, Tesla had claimed this wasn't because of its Autopilot technology failing, but rather user error, because although the autonomous system can be used as an assistance to the driver, drivers should never take their hands off the wheel. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducted an investigation into the crash, said data from the car's onboard tracking system revealed Brown had not made any attempt to brake, steer or do anything else to avoid the collision. He would have seen he was going to hit the lorry for seven seconds, which was enough for him to take action and override the Autopilot system, but he decided not to. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." The NHTSA said it would not take any action against Tesla, and found no faults with the vehicle, but would be monitoring the situation carefully to ensure it does not pose a risk to drivers. 04/01/2017: Oxford driverless car firm releases camera mapping Oxford self-driving car company Oxbotica has announced that the localisation and mapping software used in its prototype vehicles is now ready for general release. Comprising one part of the company's Selenium OS for autonomous cars, the firm has used its Dub4 software tool in the GATEway pods operating in Greenwich and in the company's own prototype vehicles, which were demonstrated in Milton Keynes last year. Oxbotica is competing in the same space as Google and Uber, but what sets it apart from other projects is that rather than the expensive laser and GPS systems seen in other cars, Oxbotica's mapping system can rely purely on vehicle-mounted cameras. "The software uses a single stereo camera mounted onto the car to determine its precise position and orientation in the world," the company explained in a statement. "With this localisation information, the software is then able to create and navigate using vision-based maps in highly unstructured environments without any reliance on GPS or expensive laser-based techniques." By negating the need for costly LIDAR systems, Dub4 has the potential to make self-driving technology much cheaper to produce, while Oxbotica claims it doesn't require specialised equipment to run; it can be installed and operated on off-the-shelf commodity PC hardware. "We're excited to be working on deployment of our class-leading Dub4 software solution, as part of our mission to achieve Level 4 autonomy by 2020," said Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith. "What we've done with Dub4 has never been done before and it represents a seismic shift for the self-driving vehicle industry, enabling a move away from GPS and 3D laser-based approaches. We're paving the way for more affordable and accurate solutions in the industry." How do self-driving cars work? Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether. Are self-driving cars safe? There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes, one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation. On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested. When will self-driving cars hit the road? In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain, so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight. Are driverless cars legal? As no fully autonomous cars have yet made it to the mass-production phase, no legislation currently exists to govern their public use. However, transport authorities both in the UK and in the US are currently in the process of drawing up new laws or amending old ones to account for driverless vehicles. In the UK, for example, companies need no permits or authorisation to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. "Real-world testing of automated technologies is possible in the UK today," the government's Pathway to Driverless Cars report reads, "providing a test driver is present and takes responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle; and that the vehicle can be used compatibly with road traffic law." The UK also plans to amend the Highway Code to allow vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems to change lanes on the motorway and be parked via remote control. Changes to car insurance would extend it to cover product liabilities for automated vehicles. Insurers would pay out to victims, then reclaim the money from the manufacturers. The US has also granted testing permits for driverless cars in four states, as well as publishing a 15-point safety checklist for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles in order to better regulate the emerging industry. Published by the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency, the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy also marks the agency's move to the SAE scale, which measures a vehicle's level of autonomy. The scale runs from zero, where the driver has total control of the vehicles, all the way to five - a totally autonomous car requiring no human input. Vehicles that measure two or three on the SAE scale - such as the Tesla and other semi-autonomous vehicles - are already road-legal both here and in the US, as the human driver is considered to be in control for the majority of the time. While many countries have committed to fostering a supportive environment for the development of autonomous cars, concrete legislation governing their use is still likely to be some years away, as the technology itself has not yet been fully finished. Who manufactures self-driving cars? The most well-known companies exploring self-driving cars are Google and Tesla, but there are very few companies connected to the automotive industry that aren't exploring the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber, for example, is currently testing its own fleet of autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Apple has also long been rumoured to be exploring the self-driving car field in some form, and has been linked to multiple different auto manufacturers, including McLaren. In addition to tech companies, however, regular car makers are also getting in on the act. Audi, Ford, BWM, Honda, Daimler, Volvo and more have all been dabbling in some form of autonomous driving project. Luxury passenger vehicles have also been experimenting with using the tech in industrial vehicles such as heavy goods lorries.

To do this, it looked at Googlesearches of "how to spell ______" in each of the states from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2017. Whatever word filled that blank most often in each state became denoted as that state's "most misspelled word." The results may not be scientific, but they sure were amusing. Perhaps most amusing, though, was that when Google first tweeted the "America's Most Misspelled Words" infographic, it pointed out that folks in Washington, D.C., needed the help of the internet to spell the word "ninety." Only, the infographic read "nintey." Google quickly corrected the graphic, allowing its viewers to focus on the peculiar results. People in Wisconsin, for example, most frequently searched for how to spell Wisconsin. The longest word Americans didn't know how to spell, searched for by both West Virginia and Connecticut users, was also an invented one: "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious," the word that one magic nanny named Mary Poppins sang about while force-feeding the children in her care liquid medicine and pure granulated sugar. (In related news, "nanny" was Mississippians's "most misspelled word.") We've made a few corrections to the legend. This is the one to use pic.twitter.com/0Z8fUlzmHc — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 The shortest word searched for, meanwhile, was "gray" by users in Georgia. It's important to note, however, that Merriam-Webster dictionary also accepts "grey" as a spelling, though it noted this is less common. "Beautiful" and "pneumonia," two very different words, tied for most "most misspelled word." Users in California, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York and Ohio searched for the former, while people in Alabama, Illinois, Maine, Michigan and Washington sought the latter. The other results simply raised questions. For example, were users in Arkansas watching old Taco Bell commercials or searching for an indoor pup when they wanted to know how to spell "Chihuahua"? And was there a rush to the zoo in Louisiana, because the "giraffe" certainly isn't native to the area? Finally, how many Reubens were being consumed during the past few months in Pennsylvania, where users were searching for how to spell "sauerkraut"? What were the people in New Jersey counting to when they sought the spelling of "twelve" and who, exactly, was searching for "people" in Hawaii? The problem with data, of course, is that it often poses more questions than it gives answers.

Liulishuo 31 May, 2017, 12:15 ET Share this article WUZHEN, China, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Liulishuo as a world's leading AI+Education company was invited to the Future of Artificial Intelligence forum held in Wuzhen, China from May 23rd to 27th. As part of the Future of Go summit, the forum opened with the first game in the three-part "man-vs-machine" Go series between Google's upgraded AlphaGo and Ke Jie, the world's top Go player. It would also share AI's most recent achievements and innovations to the world under the watchful eyes of over one thousand different media outlets in the following days. The forum opened on May 23 with the first game in the three-part "man-vs-machine" Go series between Google's upgraded AlphaGo and Ke Jie, the world's top Go player. Two of Liulishuo's co-founders, CEO Yi Wang and Chief Scientist Hui Lin, as well as its Chief Algorithm Engineer Dr. Yi Sun who joined Liulishuo early this year, watched the whole game unfold together. Dr. Sun, being the first Chinese student of Jurgen Schmidhuber, the "father of artificial intelligence" had a particular interest in the outcome. After the game concluded, Demis Hassabis, CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, had a long discussion with the Liulishuo team and praised Liulishuo's achievements in education and technology. Both parties are looking forward to deeper cooperation in the future. On May 24, the second day of the summit, many "big names" in artificial intelligence joined the Future of AI Forum, including Hassabis, Executive Chairman of Alphabet Eric Schmidt; and Jeff Dean, legendary senior engineer of the Google Brain Team. Before the forum, Yi Wang discussed future opportunities in education with Dean, who thought highly of Liulishuo's business model. During a presentation shortly afterwards, he pointed out the limitations extant in the modern education industry, saying that students can never share the same amount of resources from one instructor among a class of 30 people. One instructor can only reach a limited number of students effectively, with limited time devoted to each pupil. As such, "AI + Education" could become an exciting formula in the future. That afternoon, Yi Wang also gave a presentation about some potential applications of AI in education at the Future of AI Forum. Yi Wang pointed to three major deficiencies he sees in the traditional education systems: low efficiency, high cost, and severe inequality of resource distribution. Liulishuo self-developed the "AI English Teacher", an intelligent adaptive learning system for English language students to address these shortcomings. This was supported by the world's leading speech recognition engine and the world's largest collected speech corpus of Chinese English-language students. This software was demonstrated to triple the learning efficiency achieved by human teachers according to CEFR (The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) standards, providing real-time feedback through its multi-dimensional, multi-granularity speech scoring engine. Liulishuo's self-evolving AI English Teacher is now providing an efficient, affordable, and consistent English learning experience to over 43 million users worldwide. During this summit, a new generation of AI companies including AlphaGo and Liulishuo demonstrated their achievements within their relevant specialized areas. As a major force in current technological advancements, many specialists attest to AI's huge potential impact in industries like education, finance, transportation and security. Revolutionary products and services based upon these technologies will be introduced to the market in the very near future. AlphaGo may have defeated Chinese Go player Ke Jie, but the next breakthrough AI product may well come from China.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Thu, Jun 01, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp World Business Quick Take Agencies RIDE-HAILING Uber fires Levandowski Uber Technologies Inc on Tuesday said it had fired Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer brought in to lead the company’s self-driving automobile efforts who was accused of stealing trade secrets when he left a job at Google. “Over the last few months Uber has provided significant evidence to the court to demonstrate that our self-driving technology has been built independently,” Uber associate general counsel for employment and litigation Angela Padilla wrote in an e-mail to employees. “Over that same period, Uber has urged Anthony to fully cooperate in helping the court get to the facts and ultimately helping to prove our case. We take our obligations under the court order very seriously and so we have chosen to terminate his employment at Uber.” What Levandowski did when he quit Google to start his own company, which was acquired by Uber for nearly US$700 million last year, is the key question in a lawsuit that pits one of the world’s most powerful companies against Uber. Google was a pioneer in autonomous car technology and has spent nearly a decade on its effort, which is now run through Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc. Uber chief executive officer Travis Kalanick has said the future of his ride-hailing company, privately valued at nearly US$70 billion, hinges on work being done to create cars that can drive themselves. BANKING Deutsche hires tax expert Deutsche Bank AG has hired an expert in tax structuring as a managing director at its investment bank. The bank on Tuesday said that it had hired Jeffrey Mensch, who was most recently at MacAndrews & Forbes as a senior vice president of finance. He is the seventh managing director Deutsche Bank has hired in its Americas corporate finance group, as well as the second for its Americas mergers team. The firm, which has been rebuilding itself after years of legal troubles and declining business, is shoring up its banking business in the US. Mensch, who had also worked at the investment banks Evercore Partners, UBS Group AG and Deutsche Bank, has focused on the tax aspects of corporate finance. The specialty has become more prominent in recent years as companies have tried to use dealmaking to lower their taxes. COMMUNICATIONS American Tower mulls bid American Tower Corp is exploring a bid for Cellnex Telecom SA to expand in Europe as the Spanish tower operator’s main shareholder considers selling assets as part of a merger, people familiar with the matter said. Any offer from American Tower would hinge on the successful combination of the Spanish company’s largest shareholder, Abertis Infraestructuras SA, with Atlantia SpA, the people said. Atlantia would determine whether to sell the Abertis assets once the deal is concluded, the people said. American Tower, which has a market value of about US$56 billion, has yet to make a formal offer for the Spanish firm, another person said. No final agreements have been reached with any of the parties and the discussions might not result in a deal, the people said. TRADE US ‘open’ to resuming talks The US is “open” to resuming talks with the EU on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a senior US official said on Tuesday. “It makes sense to continue TTIP negotiations and to work towards a solution that increases overall trade while reducing our trade deficit,” US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said on CNBC.

Alicia Vitarelli reports during Action News at 4 p.m. on May, 30, 2017. (WPVI) WLS By Alicia Vitarelli and and WPVI Wednesday, May 31, 2017 05:36PM PHILADELPHIA (WLS) -- From supercalifragilisticexpialidocious to pneumonia, there's a spelling - or misspelling - crisis apparently sweeping the nation. Google would know because that's where most people turn when their initial suggestion is beyond help from autocorrect. And so, in honor of National Spelling Week, Google has mapped America's most misspelled words. In Illinois, "appreciate" is a most commonly searched in the phrase "How to spell..." In Wisconsin - the most commonly queried word is "Wisconsin." In Indiana, a lot of folks get tripped up on hallelujah - particularly the placement of that pesky "j." The same is true in Delaware. Missouri and Texas both get tripped up by "maintenance." In Kentucky, "beautiful" is found to be confusing - but that's also the case in New York, Minnesota, and California. Michigan has trouble with another commonly misspelled word - "pneumonia" - which also tripped up Googlers in Maine, Alabama, and Washington. In Pennsylvania, sauerkraut seems to be stumping people. And with BBQ season in full swing...this is a good one to master. And in New Jersey: Twelve. Jersey's isn't the only state stumbling on short words - in Oregon it's "sense," in Idaho it's "quote," in Rhode Island it's "liar," in North Carolina it's "angel," in Tennessee it's "chaos," in Mississippi it's "nanny," and in Georgia it's "gray." Connecticut and West Virginia get the over-achiever awards for most commonly asking about "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." What words give you a rough time trying to spell?

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio National Science Sports World Variety Education Real Estate Cities4Climate Online education market to hit $2 b in 4 years: Google Our Bureau comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Bengaluru, May 31:   The Indian online education market will reach $2 billion by 2021, according to a report by Google and KPMG. The report is based on a survey covering 3,600 respondents in the age group of 16-45 years across metros and non-metros. Google and YouTube search trends were also taken into account. The report pointed out that over the last couple of years, there has been a two-fold growth in online searches for education and three-fold growth in searches from a mobile device. Also, 44 per cent of education searches are now coming from beyond the top 6 metros and there has been a four-fold growth in education content consumption on YouTube in the last one year. This development needs to be seen in the backdrop of layoffs in the Indian IT services sector, which is one of the largest white-collar employers in the country. “Reskilling and online certification are the new norms at times like this,” said Nitin Bawankule, Industry Director, Google India. Cost-effective Some of the reasons Bawankule cites for the increased adoption of online education is due to lower costs, flexibility in learning, interactiveness, rising internet users and high adoption of smartphones. “Online skill enhancement courses are 50 per cent cheaper than offline alternatives,” he added. An estimated 280 million students are expected to be enrolled in schools by 2021. Industry watchers estimate that 735 million Indians will use the internet by 2021 from 409 million users currently. Bawankule also pointed out that there high growth in education search-related queries coming from cities such as Patna, Guwahati, Aligarh and Kota — which points to the opportunities that growing penetration of smartphones and improving quality of internet have opened up. The report says that in 2016, the reskilling industry alone was valued at $93 million. Add to that primary and secondary supplemental education will be the largest category by 2021, growing at 60 per cent and is expected to hit $773 million by 2021. However, Google believes that there are some challenges in this sector. Despite being cheaper than offline alternatives, it believes that for higher adoption, there is an even further need to have a variety of content at affordable prices. The report also points out that an option to pay course fees through instalments could further increase adoption.

Home > Logos > Google Doodle For Zaha Hadid, Iraqi-Born British Architect Google Doodle For Zaha Hadid, Iraqi-Born British Architect May 31, 2017 • 7:38 am | (1) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Logos Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Today on the Google home page, at least it should be worldwide but I am offline so I can't verify, is a special Google logo, Doodle for Zaha Hadid. Zaha Hadid was an Iraqi-born British architect who died last year on March 31, 2016 at the age of 65 in Miami, Florida. She was an awarded and recognized architect with well-known buildings such as the aquatic centre for the London 2012 Olympics, Michigan State University's Broad Art Museum in the US, and the Guangzhou Opera House in China. She was the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 2004. She received the UK's most prestigious architectural award, the Stirling Prize, in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, she was made a Dame by Elizabeth II for services to architecture, and in 2015 she became the first woman to be awarded the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects. So she has some accolades to say the least. Sadly she died very young from a heart attack. The Doodle Google made seems to represent the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google: Our Algorithms Share Data With Other Algorithms Google: Our Algorithms Share Data With Other Algorithms May 31, 2017 • 8:18 am | (9) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story John Mueller of Google said in a webmaster video yesterday that Google's search algorithms can and do share data from one algorithm to another. So if the Panda algorithm defines a site as being low quality, Google may share that data with their indexing algorithm to slow the crawl of the site or specific sections of the site. John Mueller said "one thing that does happen though is that sometimes quality information from one algorithm is used in other algorithms." "So for example, if we think this website is generally lower quality then that could flow into other things like, maybe maybe like, crawling and indexing speed something like," John added. He said this at the 16:48 mark into the video: One thing that does happen though is that sometimes quality information from one algorithm is used in other algorithms where when it comes to understanding like how we should be treating this website. So for example, if we think this website is generally lower quality then that could flow into other things like, maybe maybe like, crawling and indexing speed something like. I do believe Google does use machine learning algorithms for some of this. So they might pair a Panda score with a Penguin score to make up a new score - all theoretically. :) I believe we covered this before, but I cannot find where I wrote this. If you see it, link to it below. Here is the video embed: Here are some tweets from Glenn Gabe who asked the question and summarized this answer and some other answers from John Mueller around his question: Panda contd: @johnmu: But there are times quality info from 1 algo is used by other algos re: how a site is treated https://t.co/3hdycsE52E pic.twitter.com/ci19DdckdC— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) May 30, 2017 Panda contd: For ex, if an algo determines a site is lower quality, that can flow into crawling & indexing https://t.co/3hdycsE52E pic.twitter.com/KQKR0t70wd— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) May 30, 2017 Panda's connection to other quality algos cont'd @johnmu: So that each quality algo has its own dataset to work on: https://t.co/TQDRdMxFmf pic.twitter.com/BumgZ7Rz7B— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) May 30, 2017 Re: Panda's connection to other quality algos, @johnmu says Google tries to keep algos as separate as possible https://t.co/TQDRdMxFmf pic.twitter.com/aA419e87IU— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) May 30, 2017 Forum discussion at YouTube.

Name: Subject: Message: Waze’s Carpool service to expand throughout California on June 6 Newsby John Callaham14 hours ago 2 85 5 Google is expanding the reach of its Waze Carpool service beyond the pilot stage. The company has confirmed that the service will become available throughout the state of California for drivers and riders starting on Tuesday, June 6. Google first launched a pilot program for Waze Carpool in the San Francisco Bay Area in May 2016. See also: You can now record your own voice for Waze navigation 3 weeks ago According to Los Angeles Times, Google will not take a commission from Waze Carpool drivers in California, at least at first. Instead, riders will simply pay those drivers for the cost of their gas. In the future, a commission fee will be put in for each ride, but only after Google feels the service is up to its standards. Because there is no commission fee for now, Waze Carpool drivers will not need to pay for commercial car insurance, nor will they need any background checks. That makes this service different than other popular ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. However, there will be a five-star rating system, along with rider and driver endorsements, and a way for both drivers and riders to upload photos of themselves to the Waze Carpool app. Speaking of which, that’s how Google plans to make money with this service. It will be running ads inside the Waze Carpool app for both drivers and riders to check out. While riders can request a car for an immediate pick-up, Waze Carpool will also let them reserve a ride up to seven days in advance. It certainly makes sense to expand Waze Carpool to the state of California, where long commutes on the highway are very common, and vehicles with more than two people can take advantage of the many carpool lanes, which tend to be less congested. The article states that the service will expand in the near future to Brazil. We will have to wait and see if Google’s efforts can compete with the already established Uber and Lyft businesses.

General Motors and many other automakers are all looking to carve their place in the blooming industry. However, one major figure of the industry is now a free agent. The New York Times reports Anthony Levandowski has been fired from Uber, previously of Google. Levandowski left Google to start Otto, which was acquired by Uber last year. Amid the acquisition, Google’s self-driving car unit, Waymo, sued Uber for allegedly stealing trade secrets. Levandowski is said to be the cornerstone of the insider information, and is accused of using the Google/Waymo trade secrets to develop driverless car technology for Uber. Uber has urged Levandowski to cooperate with the lawsuit for months, but recently invoked his fifth amendment rights to avoid self-incrimination. When he missed an internal deadline to hand over information, Uber terminated him. The bigger picture is how incredibly valuable Levandowski is to the industry. He has spent years to become an expert in the budding field and was reportedly integral in every facet of Uber’s self-driving car program. To underscore the importance, General Motors itself has bet big on ride sharing and autonomous technology. The automaker acquired Cruise Automation for over $1 billion—it has spent quite a bit of cash to keep its talent from leaving the subsidiary now owned wholly by GM, too. GM also poured $500 million into Lyft to develop a fleet of autonomous ride-sharing cars nationwide. At the same time, Lyft also announced a newfound partnership with Waymo. The industry is fluid and ever changing and it’s poised to stay that way for some time.

Then this example of lawsuit for using company secrets can be minimized. And if every manufacturer follow SAE’s regulations and specifications, then any autonomous car can communicate with others, and unify driver operations.

A whole generation has become enamored of YouTube stars who are making as much money as, and sometimes more than, traditional television stars.  But there’s an overlooked subset that’s beginning to gain traction on the YouTube scene, and it’s one that, perhaps, is not getting as much attention as it should: beer reviews. Beer reviews have long existed on websites like BeerAdvocate (since 1996), RateBeer (established 2000), and Untappd (founded in 2010). Yet even in the age of crowdsourced beer reviews and ratings that may take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to complete and read, the beer-reviewing YouTube community is growing. “Beer is more immersive than just a 30-word review. It’s more visceral,” said Chris Steltz, founder of Beer Geek Nation, one of the original — and to date, most followed — BrewTube channels on the video-sharing site. “I always thought video would be the best way to do it.” Steltz used his video marketing degree from Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania to get his site going seven years ago. Soon enough, many followed. Beer Geek Nation currently has upwards of 40,000 subscribers, and is widely known among Internet beer geeks as the father of beer reviews on YouTube. “I break down each review into aroma, taste, and the final verdict,” said Steltz (a familiar structure evident in most, if not all, beer reviews). While others’ channels can vary from regional focuses to reviews of “whales” and other rare or impossible-to-get beers, Beer Geek Nation encompasses craft beer’s middle class. “I try to get [beers] people can access,” said Steltz. “I found that translates pretty well.” Having a YouTube channel can also be a strategic business move for some, like Chris Quinn, owner and operator of the Beer Temple in Chicago, whose YouTube channel, Craft BeerTemple actually preceded his brick-and-mortar business. Establishing a beer-loving following on YouTube a year before opening, though not intentional, enabled a built-in clientele for the beer shop. “I had a following, so people knew of what we were doing. When we tried to have a ‘soft opening’ on the first day, I took the paper down from the windows and there was a line of people waiting for me. It was kind of terrifying, but also kind of cool.” The success was not short lived, either: Beer Temple will debut a bar in their space in June. For The Wilky in Brooklyn, the beer bar’s eponymous YouTube channel has sparked conversations with customers on and off screen, according to owner and operations manager, Brian Fisher. “[We started it] to connect with people in a different way,” said Fisher. “There are so many [social media] platforms, and [YouTube] is just a fun way to share and connect with a new audience and new fans.” Putting in the time to connect with craft beer fans on YouTube will also help the Wilky stand out in New York City's competitive craft beer marketplace, Fisher said. “There is definitely a time investment, but we feel it’s worth it.” Some BrewTubers do it for the fame — who wouldn’t enjoy being recognized in breweries and having hard-to-get beers sent to them in the mail? — and others do it for the simple pleasure of sharing their opinions about the craft beer industry’s many interesting libations.  But a burning question remains: Are brewers watching? At Bottle Logic Brewing in Anaheim, California (coincidentally, the same city that hosts VidCon, an annual online video convention that attracted more than 26,400 attendees in 2016), founder and branding manager Brandon Buckner says he became aware of beer review videos after being “tagged” in them online, as well as seeing them happen in his own taproom. “I’ve seen a couple of them. There’s definitely a lot of enthusiasm. For the most part, I’ve found a lot of them to be pretty entertaining,” he said. “It’s a compliment that people would want to showcase us as a brewery, and it’s something I will pay attention to more now.” The owners of Brooklyn-based Grimm Artisanal Ales, another of BrewTube’s most reviewed brewers — particularly the locally produced Darwin’s Beer Reviews, find the medium to be time-consuming for their busy brewers’ lifestyle. “YouTube is tough because we don’t really have time to watch people's videos,” said co-founder Lauren Grimm. She also finds the platform to be limiting for brewers in terms of their ability to participate in discussions, which Grimm actively pursues in other online beer communities, like BeerAdvocate. “YouTube reviews are less about a conversation, [while] BeerAdvocate is made for that — it’s about a conversation.” The Grimms also pointed out what brewers perceive to be YouTube’s greatest flaw: subjectivity. “The danger in following a YouTuber is that it’s just one person’s opinion, which is only as valid as far as that goes. I might not always agree with what people say on Untappd, [but] that’s a lot of people registering their pleasure level,” said Joe Grimm. Additionally, as noted by Other Half Brewing co-founder and brewmaster Sam Richardson, beer reviews create style biases that skew the public’s perception of what “good” beer is. “The upside is that people are excited, and the downside is that beers are not reviewed [fairly by style],” said Richardson, who described the dilemma as “enthusiasm but not professionalism.” Among the styles that generally don’t get as much love, he said, are pilsners, because they’re “not review bait or trade bait. Double IPAs and imperial stouts are what’s popular now and other styles go by the wayside.” Despite the bias and subjectivity inherent in consumer reviews, Richardson and other popularly reviewed (and revered) brewers tend to agree that YouTube’s beer reviews are, overall, a good thing. “We’re super lucky that people are into what we do,” said Richardson. “My strong feeling is that it’s really been beneficial because people are super energetic about craft beer, and they are looking for mostly positive things to say about beer.” “There are very few industries where your customers are giving direct feedback," said Lauren Grimm. "I think it’s really important for us to understand how people are accepting our beer and reviewing it. It’s very cool that beer enthusiasts are so excited to put their words out there.” Here are 10 BeerTube Channels worth checking out...

While there is a history of the Egyptian government breaching private security, something new may be on the horizon. Mada Masr has reached out to technical experts, information security company executives and digital activists over the past few weeks to discuss the internet disturbances that have become a recurrent feature of Egypt’s online ecology. In many cases, these disturbances have completely or partially disabled the encryption services widely used by commercial and civil services and individuals to secure the flow of their data.  The anomalies in Egypt’s internet traffic began in August 2016, and, according to a government official familiar with the matter, they occurred as a result of an “official state entity” configuring a new system that would allow it to intercept online communications en masse. While most of the disturbances ceased within a few weeks, evidence has continued to arise of a systematic and comprehensive attempt by government agencies to intercept data or obstruct encryption protocols. It did not take long before a causal link was established between the issues with access to Google and the interference with Signal. Awareness of the interference did not gain traction among the wider public until late in December, when users suddenly discovered that Signal, the messaging and voice calling application supported by Open Whisper Systems’ encryption protocol, had stopped working in Egypt. Digital security experts contend that they had faced similar problems months before, a fact that led some information security companies to halt the collection of monthly fees pending a resolution. Ahmed al-Ezaby, a technical expert and the head of data security at an insurance company, says the turbulent conditions caused by interferences in secure communication could have an adverse affect on Egypt’s information technology sector, leading to the loss of millions of dollars, the closure of data security firms and the companies that depend on their services. “When considering whether to enter the Egyptian market, investors will definitely take such interventions into account,” he says. One of the fastest growing sectors in the Egyptian economy, the communication and information technology sector posted a growth rate of 11.2 percent in the first quarter of the 2016/2017 Fiscal Year, according to the Communication and Information Technology Ministry, whose minister, Yasser al-Qady, says the sector commands a 3.2 percent share of Egypt’s Gross National Product. Mada Masr contacted the minister and his office to request comment on the findings of this investigation but had not received a response at the time of publication. From directed surveillance to mass data collection Indications that the Egyptian government has made attempts to acquire technology that would allow it greater surveillance of communication networks have surfaced several times in the past few years. The most notable revelation came about as result of a July 2015 data breach when an unknown individual hacked the Milan-based information technology company HackingTeam’s computer system. Around 400 gigabytes of data – including emails, contracts, bills and budgets involving the company and Egyptian security and intelligence authorities – were made accessible to the public. Since you’re physically in Egypt, there’s not much we would be able to do to prevent them from messing with your traffic … Your government is performing Deep Packet Inspection and is messing somehow with these secure connections. In concert with other evidence, the leaked documents show that Egyptian authorities were attempting to acquire technology that would allow them to collect information on specific users of interest through directed surveillance. “But what we’re talking about now is different: The system targets Egypt’s internet traffic pipeline,” says Ahmed Mekkawy, a technical researcher and founder of the Egyptian information security company Spirula Systems, who has investigated the disturbances that have occurred over the past year. The first problem that companies and specialists faced that indicated Egyptian security agencies may be targeting the infrastructure of the entire network arose in August 2016. Technicians noted that access to Secure Shell (SSH) — a protocol to provide secure communication channels across unsecured public networks and provided by different online services providers — had been obstructed. SSH is used daily in the management of millions of communication processes that occur over the internet. Mekkawy says he was surprised about the obstruction of the SSH protocol provided by US company DigitalOcean. “Connection to their servers dropped suddenly,” Mekkawy says. “This occurred all over Egypt.” In response to the obstruction, DigitialOcean’s users and clients began to contact the company. In a response to a client’s inquiry, which was obtained by Mada Masr, DigitalOcean wrote that the interrupted service was not the result of a technical error but had been deliberately caused: “Since you’re physically in Egypt, there’s not much we would be able to do to prevent them from messing with your traffic … Your government is performing DPI [Deep Packet Inspection] and is messing somehow with these secure connections.” Data is most often transferred over the internet in small network packets that are “repackaged” and made legible on the recipient’s side. Deep packet inspection intercepts the data and examines the identity of communicators, as well as the content of this communication at an inspection point between the sender and recipient. DigitalOcean suggested contacting the Egyptian service provider TEData, owned by the Egyptian government. The US company added that they contacted both TEData and the Egyptian government to inquire about the interruption. In December, five months after the incidents began, DigitalOcean told Mada Masr that they had not completed their investigation. “The monitoring system is active, traces any connection attempts, analyzes them and throttles them.” Days after the interruption in the SSH protocol was detected, access to HTTPS was blocked. HTTPS is a protocol to securely transfer hypertexts, which constitute the core units of all webpages. Mekkawy says that the protocol continued to operate without interruption for internet giants like Facebook and Google but was completely blocked for all other websites, prompting him to draw the conclusion that the Egyptian government throttled HTTPS for all websites except those that would draw too much attention. In order to gain further information, Mekkawy sent a data packet and traced it through the network. The communication process takes place in two stages: first, the automated handshaking process sets the parameters of the communication channel established between two entities, after which the communication is encrypted. “The first packets sent from the computer dropped halfway through,” says Mekkawy. The only explanation for this, he adds, is that there is a monitoring system that traces and obstructs packages emanating from Egypt. To test the issue on a larger scale, Mekkawy established several virtual private network (VPN) connections – through which a user is able to connect to a private server and then send and receive data across public networks securely. “My attempts to connect using VPN servers were immediately blocked the next day, which means that the monitoring system is active, traces any connection attempts, analyzes them and throttles them,” says Mekkawy. From Tor to Signal: Further signs of expanded security intervention Mekkawy was not the only one attempting to trace and analyze the technical disturbances. The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) – an international network operating under the Tor Project that monitors internet censorship, traffic manipulation and signs of surveillance – decided to launch a thorough investigation in August into what was happening in Egypt at the request of technical experts in the country. In October, OONI published a report that confirmed much of what the independent tests had pointed to, as well as DigitalOcean’s assessment. “Our findings indicate that the Tor anonymity network appeared to be interfered with in Egypt, while HTTPS connections to DigitalOcean’s Frankfurt data centre were throttled. We also found that access to porn sites appeared to be interfered with via in-band TCP packet injections of advertisement and malware content, and that the blocking of The New Arab website led to the blocking of specific content (such as images) of other sites that are hosted on the same Content Distribution Network (CDN),” the OONI report asserted. Although the report did not address the party behind the interference, the company suggested that the interruption of the Tor browser was caused by a RST injection, which Open Whisper Systems also suggested was behind the interference with Signal. Furthermore, OONI’s report stated that the injected RST packet observed to obstruct user-server communication with The New Arab website shared the “static IP identification (IP ID) value of 0x3412 as the injected RST packets” used in an attempt to block Tor. This similarity is significant as The New Arab, which is Qatari-funded and sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood, is known to be blocked by the Egyptian government, suggesting that a state agency using the same server location conducted the RST injection attacks on Tor. The government source that attributed the initial disturbances to the state’s configuration of new surveillance software also asserted the disturbances would “end soon,” a suggestion that was corroborated in the weeks that followed when the protocols began working again. However, a return to operation does not necessarily mean that the surveillance software has ceased to function but may more realistically point to its seamless integration. Nonetheless, service disturbances indicating some type of interference did not halt completely, as users reported being unable to access the home page of Google’s search engine – although, the Egyptian Google domain www.google.com.eg was functioning normally – from all Egyptian service providers. It did not take long before a causal link was established between the issues with access to Google and the interference with Signal. When Signal, the messaging and voice calling application supported by Open Whisper Systems’ encryption protocol and used by a wide range of agents in Egypt for its high-security standards and commitment to open-source software, suddenly stopped working in December, Open Whisper Systems launched a technical investigation. At the conclusion of its inquiry into the problem, the developer laid blame for the issue at the feet of the Egyptian government. Days later, Open Whisper Systems released an update that would allow users in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates to bypass government interference by deploying a technique known as domain fronting, which uses content distribution networks, such as Google, to allow communication between the company’s servers and users’ devices. Domain fronting was automatically enabled for all Signal users whose associated phone number is listed under an Egyptian or UAE country code. With the update, when a user sends a message via Signal, it will resemble a regular HTTPS request to content delivery networks (CDNs) like Google. If a state wishes to prevent people from sending messages on Signal, it will have to block all access to Google’s website, according to a statement from the company. When the interruptions to Google surfaced, Open Whisper Systems tweeted, “Egypt keeps trying to block Signal, inadvertently blocking all of Google, and having to stop as a result. We’ll also expand domain fronts.” Egypt keeps trying to block Signal, inadvertently blocking all of Google, and having to stop as a result. We'll also expand domain fronts. https://t.co/Gb7ulEDQyk — Open Whisper Systems (@whispersystems) January 5, 2017 A history of war on the internet Access to the internet has been a controversial topic for the Egyptian government, especially after the January 2011 revolution, as seen in the recurrent arrests and trial of Facebook page administrators. The government is also currently preparing legislation to combat cybercrime. In a joint policy report published in June 2016 and titled “Anti-Technology,” the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, Support for Information Technology and the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression wrote that the law “violates the principle of equality before the law and contains penalties regarding the use of information technology.” In April 2016, sources with direct knowledge of discussions between Facebook and the Egyptian government told Reuters that Egypt blocked Facebook Free Basics internet service at the end of 2015 after the US company refused to give the state the ability to monitor users. A month earlier, in March, Google published a statement, asserting that it had became “aware of unauthorized digital certificates for several Google domains” issued by an intermediate certificate authority held by the Egyptian company MCS Holdings, which had been contracted by CNNIC to issue certificates for domains that they had registered. “Rather than keep the private key in a suitable HSM, MCS installed it in a man-in-the-middle proxy. These devices intercept secure connections by masquerading as the intended destination and are sometimes used by companies to intercept their employees’ secure traffic for monitoring or legal reasons,” the Google statement read. In a previous report, Mada Masr highlighted leaked documents that emerged after Cairo’s State Security headquarters was stormed by protesters in March 2011, which showed that MCS had been corresponding with the State Security Investigation Service (SSIS) to obtain the FinFisher system, surveillance software offered by Anglo-German company Gamma International.  The Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the University of Toronto, scanned several countries throughout December 2012 and January 2013 to search for the use of Blue Coat Devices’ products, which have been known to be used to violate human rights. In its published findings, the laboratory found that the Egyptian government had used a ProxySG to monitor, trace and randomly filter content to users. Map of countries using Planet Blue Coat services According to the most recent statistics published by the Communication and Information Technology Ministry, the number of internet users in Egypt at the end of 2016 had increased to 30 million, a breadth that represents a tremendous challenge to a state security sector that desires to surveil each user, making the random monitoring provided by mass data collection attractive. However, mass surveillance of data exchanges and communications lacks legal and constitutional ground. According to Article 57 of the Constitution, “Postal, telegraphic and electronic correspondences, telephone calls, and other means of communication are inviolable, and their confidentiality is guaranteed. They may not be confiscated, revealed or monitored except by virtue of a reasoned judicial order, for a definite period, and only in the cases defined by law.” Moreover, the 2003 telecommunications law guarantees “the rights of the Users, especially their privacy rights in accordance with the law, and without disturbing the National Security, the State top interests, urban planning and health and environmental standards that are specified by the relevant Ministries and Heads of concerned entities.” The 2003 statute remains controversial, however, due to the import of several articles, notably Article 64, which grants Egypt’s security forces broad power in intervening in telecommunications networks: “With due consideration to inviolability of citizens private life as protected by law, each Operator and Provider shall, at his own expense, provide within the telecommunication networks licensed to him all technical potentials including equipment, systems, software and communication which enable the Armed Forces, and National Security Entities to exercise their powers within the law.” The law that Article 64 references is the criminal procedures code, which imposes certain restrictions on security force’s surveillance of Egyptian nationals. “ The investigating magistrate may order the seizure of all letters, correspondences, newspapers, publications and packages found at post offices and all telegrams found at telegram offices and may order the surveillance of telecommunications or recording of conversations taking place in a specific place whenever deemed necessary for the revelation of the truth in a crime or misdemeanor punishable by incarceration for no less than a three-month period … In all cases, the acts of seizure, inspection, surveillance or recording shall be on the grounds of a justified warrant, for a period of time no longer than thirty days subject to renewal for another equivalent period or periods of time,” reads Article 9 of the telecommunications law. Does the government have the right to send detectives after all citizens, mapping and monitoring all forms of communication? Amr Gharbeia, the Egyptian Institute for Personal Rights’ (EIPR) technology and freedoms program officer, believes that the provisions of the criminal procedures code governing surveillance of phone calls should apply to all electronic communication. “Targeted surveillance should have a specific target, for a specific case, within a preset time frame,” Gharbeia says. “But mass surveillance is different. It traces and monitors all sorts of communication between everyone, with no need for legal cover.” The same thing would apply for online publications, according to Gharbeia. “Investigations too have their regulations, among which is that they have to be related to a specific interrogation not a random digging for information and data, and should be coherent with their purpose.” It seems that the technical and legal battle over online surveillance will be a protracted affair, given that there appears to be an imbalance in the government’s position. On the one hand, the state has a desire to build and develop telecommunications and the information security sector. However, on the other hand, there are government agencies focused on their own control of internet communications in Egypt. The government doesn’t have the right to send detectives after all citizens, says Gharbeia. “Does it have the right to trace all the interactions within the country, mapping and monitoring all forms of communication between people, and to record every discussion in the public domain?” AD You Might Have Missed The IMF as knee surgeon on a cancerous patient Review of Sidewalk Salon, 1001 Street Chairs of Cairo Trump’s first days in office: A slew of devastating presidential orders A profile of the activist outside his prison AD   Topics communications disruptions internet surveillance internet use telecommunications Related communications disruptions Signal bypasses Egyptian authorities’ interference with update to application Signal's developers released an update allowing the app to bypass interference from Egypt and the UAE 22 December 2016 communications disruptions Signal unstable: Alternatives to the encrypted messaging application Mohamed Hamama | After interruptions in Signal's service, here are messaging applications that allow users to securely 19 December 2016 DaVinci Hack of Italian surveillance firm uncovers contract with Egypt An unknown team of hackers released a bundle of files on Sunday revealing that the Defense Ministry has 6 July 2015 General Intelligence Monitoring communication: Where will the state’s attempts to control ‘space’ lead?

The developer revealed that a number of internet service providers in Egypt had disrupted Signal communications services and access to the Open Whisper Systems’ website, a move it attributed to Egyptian authorities. “We’ve been investigating over the weekend, and have confirmed that Egypt is censoring access to Signal,” Open Whisper Systems stated via its Twitter account. “It turns out that when some states can’t snoop, they censor.” The company is working on further updates to address censorship, which it states should be implemented in the coming weeks. Until these are released, the company has informed users that they can continue to access Signal through the Tor Browser or a virtual private network (VPN). The update Open Whisper Systems released on Wednesday is able to circumvent government service by deploying a technique know as domain fronting, which uses content distribution networks, such as Google, to allow communication between the company’s servers and users’ devices.

In August, technicians noted that access to Secure Shell (SSH) — a protocol to provide secure communication channels across networks provided by different sponsors — had been obstructed. Each day, SSH is used in the management of millions of communication processes that occur over the Internet. Access was blocked days later to the HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol) — a technique to ensure secure communications over a computer network via the transport layer security. Recent OONI probes and reports reveal that Egyptian internet service providers — TE Data, Noor and Vodafone — have been involved in blocking access to several websites, disabling the HTTPS security feature, injecting pop-up advertisements into the browser interface and disseminating malware.

(REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni) How can a company that is going to generate $2,000,000,000 in negative free cash flow in 2017 be worth $70 billion?  Netflix has soared in popularity in recent years, but so have its financial losses. Just like during the original tech bubble, investors are ignoring basic fundamentals and are greatly rewarding firms that are bleeding giant mountains of cash year after year just because they are trendy tech companies. But somewhere along the line, you actually have to quit losing money if you are going to survive. Just ask tech bubble 1.0 victims pets.com, Webvan and eToys.com. The investors who poured enormous amounts of money into those companies ended up losing everything, and similar tragedies will play out as tech bubble 2.0 bursts. So far in 2017, the S&P 500 is up about 8 percent, but FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) are up a whopping 30 percent. But at least Facebook, Amazon and Google are making money. Netflix is not. So why in the world has the stock shot up by more than 30 percent so far this year? It just doesn't make any sense at all. According to CNBC, during the first quarter Netflix had $423 million in negative free cash flow, and for the entire year it is being projected that it will have $2 billion in negative free cash flow: The California-based company is now dumping cash into original content to maintain its dominance over its growing field of rivals. The company had $423 million negative free cash flow during the quarter, wider than the $261 million negative free cash flow a year ago. Netflix expects to have $2 billion in negative free cash flow this year. The bleeding of cash at Netflix only seems to be accelerating. The number for the first quarter of 2017 was 62 percent worse than the number for the first quarter of 2016, and it was more than twice as bad as the number for the first quarter of 2015. It is hard to imagine Netflix will ever be more popular than it is right now. So if Netflix is not making a profit at this point, when will it ever make a profit? Similar things could be said about Twitter. This is a company that has never made a yearly profit and is actually starting to see revenues decline. But somehow the stock just continues to go up. Since the last time I wrote about Twitter, the market cap has shot up another $1.5 billion. At this point, the market values Twitter at $13 billion, but in the entire history of the company it has actually lost $2 billion. What we are witnessing is a modern-day version of tulip mania, and at some point, this irrational euphoria will come to a sudden end. In fact, there are already some signs that tech bubble 2.0 may be in a significant amount of trouble. The following is an excerpt from a Bloomberg article entitled "Investors Go All-In on Tech Giants": <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1835868955" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1835868955" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement The tech-powered rally has catapulted the sector to a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.4, or 41 percent above the 10-year average. But as Google and Amazon stretch to nearly $1,000 a share, not everyone is comfortable with the valuations. Investors pulled more than $716 million from the most popular technology exchange-traded fund last week—the $17.4 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, or XLK—its largest weekly outflow in over a year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. "Most everybody remembers 2000, so they might be getting a little nervous with this development," said Maley. "I just wonder how many people have said to themselves, 'If AMZN gets to $1,000, I'm going to take at least some profits.'" All over the financial world, prominent voices are warning that the enormous financial bubbles that we see all around us are not sustainable and that a major crisis is heading our way. I wrote about some of these voices yesterday, and today we can add Paul Singer to the list: Given groupthink and the determination of policy makers to do 'whatever it takes' to prevent the next market 'crash,' we think that the low-volatility levitation magic act of stocks and bonds will exist until the disenchanting moment when it does not. And then all hell will break loose (don't ask us what hell looks like ...), a lamentable scenario that will nevertheless present opportunities that are likely to be both extraordinary and ephemeral. The only way to take advantage of those opportunities is to have ready access to capital. When the financial markets collapse, Donald Trump will likely get most of the blame. But Donald Trump did not create the stock market bubble, and he will not be responsible for ending it either. Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, we have seen this same story play out over and over again. There have been 18 distinct recessions or depressions since the Fed was established, and the more the Fed interferes in the marketplace, the larger the booms and busts tend to be. And it could be argued that this time around the Fed has manipulated financial markets more than ever before. Interest rates were pushed as low as possible, and trillions of dollars were pumped into the financial system during the Fed's quantitative easing programs. Of course those actions were going to create a huge bubble, and of course that bubble will inevitably burst. Unfortunately, this is not just a game. Real people with real hopes and real dreams are going to be absolutely devastated. Millions of Americans who were carefully saving for retirement are going to be financially crippled, and pension funds all over the nation are going to be wiped out. I don't know why we can't seem to learn from history. And I am not talking about events that happened decades ago. The build up to this coming crisis is so similar to what we witnessed just before the crashes of 2000 and 2008, but we just keep getting fooled over and over again. But once things fall apart this time, I think the American people will finally be fed up. I think that they will be sick and tired of an unelected, unaccountable central bank that creates endless booms and busts, and I think that they will finally be ready to push Congress to shut the Federal Reserve down for good.

Miller May 30, 2017 10 Comments In the last few weeks, there have been a number of important introductions of new computing platforms designed specifically for working on deep neural networks for machine learning. In the last few weeks, there have been a number of important introductions of new computing platforms designed specifically for working on deep neural networks for machine learning, including Google's new "cloud TPUs" and Nvidia's new Volta design. To me, this is the most interesting trend in computer architecture—even more than AMD and now Intel introducing 16-core and 18-core CPUs. Of course, there are other alternative approaches, but Nvidia and Google are deservedly getting a lot of attention for their unique approaches. At Google I/O, I saw it introduce what a "cloud TPU" (for Tensor Processing Unit, indicating that it is optimized for Google's TensorFlow machine learning framework). The previous generation TPU, introduced at last year's show, is an ASIC designed primarily for inferencing—running machine learning operations—but the new version is designed for inferencing and training such algorithms. In a recent paper, Google gave more details on the original TPU, which it described as containing a matrix of 256-by-256 multiple-accumulate (MAC) units (65,536 in total) with a peak performance of 92 teraops (trillion operations per second). It gets its instructions from a host CPU over PCIe Gen 3 bus. Google said this was a 28nm die that was less than half the size of an Intel Haswell Xeon 22nm processor, and that it outperformed that processor and Nvidia's 28nm K80 processor. The new version, dubbed TPU 2.0 or cloud TPU, (seen above), actually contains four processors on the board, and Google said each board is capable of reaching 180 teraflops (180 trillion floating point operations per second). Just as importantly, the boards are designed to work together, using a custom high-speed network, so they act as a single machine learning supercomputing that Google calls a "TPU pod." This TPU pod contains 64 second-generation TPUs and provides up to 11.5 petaflops to accelerate the training of a single large machine learning model. At the conference, Fei Fei Li, who heads Google's AI research, said that while one of the company's large-scale learning models for translation takes a full day to train on 32 of the best commercially available GPUs, it can now be training to the same accuracy in an afternoon using one-eighth of a TPU pod. That's a big jump. Understand that these are not small systems—a Pod looks to be about the size of four normal computing racks. And each of the individual processors seem to have very large heat sinks, meaning the boards can't be stacked too tightly. Google hasn't yet given a lot of detail on what has changed in this version of the processors or the interconnect, but it's likely this as well is based around 8-bit MACs. The week before, Nvidia introduced its latest entry in this category, a massive chip known as the Telsa V100 Volta, which it described as the first CPU with this new Volta architecture, designed for high-end GPUs. Nvidia said the new chip is capable of 120 TensorFlow teraflops (or 15 32-bit TFLOPS or 7.5 64-bit ones.) This uses a new architecture that includes 80 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), each of which includes eight new "Tensor Cores" and is a 4x4x4 array capable of performing 64 FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) operations per clock. Nvidia said it will offer the chip in its DGX-1V workstations with 8 V100 boards in the third quarter, following the firm's earlier DGX-1 that used the earlier P100 architecture. The company said this $149,000 box should deliver 960 teraflops of training performance, using 3200 watts. Later on, the first said, it would ship a Personal DGX Station with a four V100s, and in the fourth quarter, it said the big server vendors will ship V100 servers. This chip is the first announced to use TSMC's 12nm processor, and it will be a huge chip with 21.1 billion transistors on 815 square millimeter die. Nvidia cited both Microsoft and Amazon as early customers for the chip. Related The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 Note there are big differences between these approaches. The Google TPUs are really custom chips, designed for TensorFlow applications, while the Nvidia V100 is a somewhat more general chip, capable of different kinds of math for other applications. Meanwhile, the other big cloud providers are looking at alternatives, with Microsoft using both GPUs for training and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for inferencing, and offering both to customers. Amazon Web Services now make both GPU and FPGA instances available to developers. And Intel has been pushing FPGAs and a host of other techniques. Meanwhile, a number of new start-ups are working on alternative approaches. In some ways, this is the most drastic change we've seen in workstation and server processors in years, at least since developers first started using "GPU compute" several years ago. It will be fascinating to see how this develops. Back to top Previous : AMD Introduces Epyc Server Chip, 16-Core Desktop Chip Google Apps, Tools Aim to 'Democratize AI' Next : By Michael J.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A Sponsored by CallRail Google AdWords Updates to Keep in Mind in 2017 (Article 2 of 2) by Zack Bedingfield [Sponsored Content]  |   May 31, 2017  |  866 views Tweet Kindle Email Top In the first article of this two-part series, we covered some important recent changes to Google's search algorithms. The goal of this second article is to give digital marketers an idea of how the most significant changes in Google's paid products will affect your strategy in 2017 and beyond. Exact Match Keyword Change for Paid Search Heralded as the destruction of exact match keywords and everything we hold dear, the most recent exact match keyword update updates the definition of exact match close variants, potentially matching keywords to a far wider host of queries. Essentially, Google is expanding the definition to make sure search advertisers don't have to have every variant of a keyword in their account in order to serve ads for all qualified searches. For example, to serve for the query [nike shoes for women], we'd need to have the word "for" included in our exact match keyword. Since the search intent behind both [nike shoes for women] and [nike shoes women] is the same, Google wants to make sure you're serving for both of the searches. Google does clarify: It'll still be attempting to match for the most accurate keyword. So, if you do have both terms in your account, everything is business as usual: Your longer-tail variant will still have a higher AdRank, and that will be the keyword matched to. For anyone relying on broader keywords, however, or if the adding of function words (like "for") would change the intent of searches for your product, be sure to add these function words (for, the, from, to, etc.) as negatives to the applicable ad groups/campaigns. Exact match keywords will also start matching to queries in which the search terms have been reordered. Consider, for instance, this example from Google: Phone Number Changes for Ads The next biggest change this year was the decision to start automatically adding call extensions to AdWords ads—a move by Google to continue to build value in its AdWords product by giving customers insight into phone calls. The call tracking/analytics space has undergone so much growth precisely because consumers and Google are realizing there's an incredible amount of value to be had from calls. Gone are the days in which pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is viable only for e-commerce or SaaS businesses. Home services and retail receive lots of phone calls, and for PPC agencies and in-house managers to prove value (especially to those clients with smaller budgets), calls are quickly becoming a primary key performance indicator (KPI). The new call extensions will automatically be added to ads that don't have call extensions. Where will they get the phone numbers, you ask? Google stated that it'll be pulling phone numbers "prominently" featured on landing pages. How "prominent" does a phone number have to be? Well, we're still not sure, but per that announcement, and the one about Google's pulling in GMB numbers to ads to replace call extensions, it's likely most ads will end up having a phone number if there is one featured on the page at all. The important point to note here, however, is that regardless of the number pulled in you can still override the automated call extension with extensions you set up yourself. Clearly, then, the update is a big push for Google to have everyone running numbers on all their ads. It makes AdWords that much more valuable, and it provides more value to searchers looking for businesses, products, and more on Google. For any advertiser running DNI (dynamic number insertion) on its site, Google has stated it won't automatically pull numbers from that site. In contrast to advertisers' ability to override these automated extensions with their own manually added extensions, Google's announcement to possibly pull numbers from multi-location Google My Business (GMB) listings and add those, instead of call extensions, doesn't give us much faith in having full control over what extensions run. What this would mean is that multi-location businesses will start to see fewer calls coming in through their call extensions, and more coming in through the GMB numbers. The biggest issue here is the mixing of paid and organic results. When previously you knew that a call to the GMB number was due to organic, now a call to that number could be from paid. Because we can't imagine Google wants us to live in this world of ambiguity, we'll likely see another announcement this year clearing up this issue. IF Functions in AdWords Ads Announced in January of this year, IF functions provide the same amount of functionality advertisers previously had with ad customizers, but without the feed via spreadsheet. These functions allow you to customize your ads based on specific dates, placement in certain audience segments, device type, and more. These functions can add a lot of value to your current ads, depending on your target market, product, and current account segmentation. See the example: Your ad copy can vary based on the device the user is on or the user's presence on a certain audience list. This function is particularly helpful for e-commerce businesses, especially those that don't have the account expertise or time to segment these categories into their own campaigns. That said, for a smaller account there may not be a significant enough search volume to warrant segmenting all your mobile traffic into another campaign, or for targeting different audience segments in separate campaigns. In that case, using an IF Function could provide tremendous value: So: What Should PPC Marketers Expect? With the exact match keyword change, a lot of advertisers without a robust keyword list will see an increase in search volume. That said, anyone who's already running a large variety of long-tail exact match keywords, alongside phrase and broad variants with robust negative lists, will likely see little to no change at all. The important thing here is to continue to be vigilant with your negative work, and the change shouldn't affect your account much one way or another. If your keyword list could have done with being built out further by additional exact match variants, it could even help your account (which is Google's intention). With Google's change to call extensions, we should continue to remember that phone calls are a valuable KPI for most businesses. Even e-commerce and SaaS companies get phone calls, so it's important to gain insight into calls. Even more valuable are the calls that come into businesses as a primary KPI: Home services, doctors, etc. all rely on phone calls to keep the doors open, so it's that much more important to track them properly. That's why it becomes even more important to choose the right call tracking/analytics vendor to get you and your clients the insight they need. With IF functions in ads, we should expect increased competition as ads become even more targeted toward specific audience segments. Remarketing lists for search (RLSA) has been out for a long time, but not all advertisers are taking advantage of audience segmentation to change both their bids and their ad copy. Google's move to add IF functions is a move to bring this kind of ad customization to more advertisers, add more value to AdWords as a platform, and provide a better ad experience for searchers. * * * It's still a very exciting time for advertisers in PPC. As search volume increases, our toolset continues to grow; and as our tool set continues to grow, so does our value as marketers. With all the changes listed in this article, we should see increased activity in our accounts, more phone calls, and better CTRs. So long as we continue to monitor these changes and implement them advantageously in our accounts, we should stay ahead of the curve and we and our clients should continue to be happy.

SHANGHAI, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- On May 23rd the first game of a three-part Go series between Google's AI AlphaGo and the world's number one Go player Ke Jie took place at the opening event of the Future of Go summit in Wuzhen, China. AlphaGo defeated Ke Jie by just half a point after four hours and fifteen minutes of play, taking a 1-0 lead in the series. Two former Google scientists predicted AlphaGo's win to the press long before the game started. As Dr. Hui Lin, now co-founder and Chief Scientist of Liulishuo and Dr. Yi Sun, its Chief Algorithm Engineer watched the game unfold, the two scientists declared "the result was expected". Some experts predicted Ke Jie had a better chance to win than Lee Sedol, the last human Go player to officially test the AI as he came better prepared for Google's DeepMind Go-playing machine AlphaGo. Dr. Hui Lin had a different outlook, however. "The machine has a huge advantage in calculating and processing sophisticated situations. Moreover, when heading to the later stages of the game, a human can never control their emotion like a machine does." From left to right：Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Liulishuo Dr. Hui Lin, Chief Algorithm Engineer of Liulishuo Dr. Yi Sun Dr. Yi Sun at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen "Looking back on AlphaGo1.0, AlphaGo2.0 offers a more significant mastering of artificial intelligence over board games, with its unattainable amount of training," Dr. Hui Lin said. "At this point, AI's intelligence basically relies on its gigantic database. AlphaGo's input includes every manual and game record anyone could think of, so it's safe to say that it knows its opponents well enough. AI has many widely accepted qualities like ultra-speed calculation, but its advantage over conventional training can only be revealed when it is upgraded." Dr. Lin also explained from a technical perspective why Ke Jie described AlphaGo's moves as "mysterious" during warm-up stages, "AlphaGo won because it was unpredictable. Technically, we can't say that AlphaGo is the best Go student ever 'taught' by human beings, because it could never be restricted by any human rules. Incorporating lessons from AlphaGo1.0, AlphaGo2.0 was able to learn from all manuals and records in existence. AI never stops playing by itself, as it never eats or sleeps, and eventually it develops its own strategy, regardless of human restrictions." A graduate from the world's leading Swiss AI Lab IDSIA and instructed by the "father of artificial intelligence" Jurgen Schmidhuber, Dr. Yi Sun has always paid close attention to DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg's AI projects, who also happens to be an IDSIA alumnus. After today's game, he praised the technical improvements of this AlphaGo version in Wuzhen, compared to how the project performed back when it was still in development under the pseudonym "Master". Dr. Yi Sun considered reinforcement learning technology as AlphaGo2.0's main highlight. As this technology was one of his research areas at PhD level, Dr. Sun explained the purpose of this concept from the inside out, "To accomplish a sophisticated goal through the interaction of an AI and unknown environments, which in this case means to make judgments on a given Go game situation. Reinforcement learning allows the AI to study every middle-game as a "value function" and every move as a "q function" from an ocean of game records. AlphaGo built a new model in this environment, based on AlphaGo1.0's interaction history. This model would go on to learn the best outcomes of each situation through numerous mistakes, and learn to make plans in the face of uncertainty. As a result, its anticipation and positioning skills also improved to the next level." Reinforcement learning now shows strong potential in practical applications also. Liulishuo's AI English Teacher was self-developed based on reinforcement learning algorithms similar to those described by Dr. Yi Sun. Along with the supervision of its two specialists, Liulishuo's AI builds an adaptive learning system through continuous reinforcement learning and self-evolution. The result is a truly personalized and adaptive learning path for every user, providing better learning efficiency. On May 24th both AlphaGo and Ke Jie will take one day off, and AI specialists from DeepMind and Google will discuss the future of AI as part of the Future of Go Summit being held in Wuzhen, China. Yi Wang, the CEO and co-founder of Liulishuo will also share his ideas of applying AI to education during the summit. As for Ke Jie, he still has the chance to defeat the upgraded AlphaGo during the two remaining games on May 25th and 27th.

At the OpenJaw Summit in Dublin last week, attendees listened to Dr David Rogers from Columbia University share his take on the theory and practice of digital transformation, which is based on the premise that “it is not about tech, it is about a mindset.” And one way to change the mindset is “to identify the unconscious assumptions” which define how a business sees itself – not only independently but also in relation to its peers and the wider world. He identified unconscious assumptions in five areas of business and used examples from outside of travel to illustrate his points. Specific applications to travel are possible by cross-referencing other speakers at the event. Customers He began with customers – very often overlooked – and said they need to be seen not as “passive targets but as dynamic networks”. His example is Domino’s Pizza and the quotation from its CEO that Domino’s “is as much a tech company as it is a pizza company.” Domino’s is thinking “dynamically” by exploiting Alexa, Twitter and even emojis as a means to order a pizza rather than just waiting passively for the orders to come in. But this only came about by the business challenging its own perceptions. In a travel context, most firms have moved beyond seeing customers as passive targets, and the familiar idea of the funnel/customer journey/path to purchase reflects the idea that travellers are dynamic, requiring businesses to adopt different means to interact at different stages. Meg Elzea, one of Google’s global travel industry managers for airlines, offered what other delegates on the sidelines  agreed was a fresh segmentation of customers. So goodbye micro-moments, hello intent clusters. Customers, she argued, need to be “at the centre [of marketing campaigns], not the content or the channel.” Four intent clusters are identified – see, think, do, care. At one end, “see” is close to the old-school idea of raising brand awareness in a generic way without trying to convert or seal the deal. At the other end “care” is the intent cluster where your existing customers can be maintained or reconverted. The example she offered was the Nike Run Club, an example of a “network within a network”, or in a travel context, a loyalty scheme. Data Loyalty schemes were represented at the event by Remi Lafrance, general manager for product transformation at Toronto-listed Aimia, which works with 300 loyalty programmes with some 300 million members in total. Evidently this gives it access to a fair bit of data, with Lafrance saying that its approach is to “identify the required  data assets and get them.” Data is another area Rogers identified as being plagued by assumptions, agreeing with Lafrance that data should not be seen as a silo but as a “strategic asset”. And while there is a monetary value to data, it is operationally where the true value lies. Having said that, the example given was a slightly awkward one around Caesers Entertainment rethinking its use of data. Traditionally casinos have been able to identify high rollers and give them upgrades and a VIP experience. But what data can now do, he said, is “shape the experience of the guest in real-time, on property.” Caesers can now use data to identify a loyal customer, gauge his or her performance at the tables and offer a real-time benefit such as a free dinner to help ease the pain of monetary losses and help retain that customer. “Data” has been doing the rounds at travel conferences for some time, but rarely do the moral or privacy considerations of data sharing get a mention. Following a presentation by Declan Hoare, chief technology officer at Ludex, a question from the floor brought “GDPR” to the fore, albeit briefly. Ludex is working with OpenJaw on a number of initiatives around artificial intelligence and machine learning, and is an IBM Watson Ecosystem Partner. GDPR is the acronym for the European Union’s updated data privacy regulations, which come into force on 25 May 2018 “at which time those organizations in non-compliance will face heavy fines”. For reference, here is the summary paragraph on consent: “The conditions for consent have been strengthened, and companies will no longer be able to use long illegible terms and conditions full of legalese, as the request for consent must be given in an intelligible and easily accessible form, with the purpose for data processing attached to that consent.” The implications of GDPR will become clear, possibly, over time, but it is an elephant in the room when it comes to many data-based initiatives in travel. Did the Pope realise when he (or one of his people) agreed to Twitter’s terms and conditions that he was allowing IBM Watson to generate a publicly available personality profile based on its interpretation of the tone and content of his tweets? Innovation As well as data, innovation is a travel conference regular. Scott Morrison from ThinkSprint, “a kick ass platform of future thinkers”, defined innovation as “finding ways to join the dots that other people miss, at speed” with the aim of “creating new revenue streams through rapid innovation”. Innovation is another component of the digital transformation identified by Rogers as being shackled by unconscious assumptions – in this case the idea that it needs to be planned from the top down. Instead, innovation needs to be seen as rapid experimentation. The travel context of this is very much on message for OpenJaw, which has adopted Google Ventures Sprint Process for its Project X initiative. The sprint process is a five-day timeline for which is intended to get something to the testing stage within five working days. Project X is overseen by OpenJaw’s co-founder Sean Mac Roibeaird. He talked about aiming for 10X not 10% improvement, avoiding group think, getting in external experts and generally seeing “innovation” as a way to get better at experimentation and develop frameworks which can be applied elsewhere in the business, rather than seeing a direct line between innovation and success. He said that this “sprint” approach has paved the way for some of the new t-Retail Cloud features, particularly in terms of its supplier, marketing and social components. Competition The competitive landscape has changed in most verticals over the past twenty years or so, and travel is one of the most exposed to digital and socio-economic shifts. Rogers talked about competition generally being “asymmetric” – the need for firms to partner with their rivals. The example he gave was Google paying Apple $1 billion so that it would be the default search engine on iPhones. In travel, there are many examples of this asymmetry. Expedia is a competitor to travel agents but is also making its inventory available to them via its affiliate network; booking.com competes with hotels for bookings but has a whole bunch of B2B products for hotels to make them better at selling on the platform; metas and Google take advertising dollars from suppliers but are looking increasingly at a more direct relationship via facilitated bookings, the list goes on. Value Competition, data, innovation and customers are relatively concrete concepts in terms of digital transformation, but Rogers’ final piece of the puzzle is a little more esoteric, and that is “value”. He said businesses need to “adapt” their value proposition rather than “defend” its existing position. His example was the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s “Digital Met” project, which helped it “fight for relevance” by using multimedia to create gaming experiences for teenagers, telling the stories behind its acquisitions, running hacks and getting hip-hop artists to curate virtual tours of its digital archive. Many travel brands have adapted their value proposition rather than defend it. Europe’s biggest travel firm TUI is an example of a business which pre-dates digital, was force to adapt and which continues to be successful and grow. It could be argued that its rival Thomas Cook spent too long defending and is now playing catch-up. Rogers rounded off by highlighting the Encyclopedia Brittanica as perhaps the best example of a business which can manage a digital transformation, surviving Encarta and Wikipedia by becoming a B2B edu-tech provider. “If it can manage a digital transformation, anyone can,” he said.

It Doesn't Know Enough About You By Kevin Maney On 5/30/17 at 12:25 PM Close Tech & Science Apple big data Alphabet Amazon Facebook Microsoft Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are the five most valuable U.S. companies, in that order. By 2025, it’s a good bet at least one will no longer be on that list. Which company will that be? Maybe the one starting to move into a $5 billion headquarters building that looks like a cross between a starship and a Bundt cake? It’s simplistic but fun to base Apple’s prospects entirely on the Edifice complex, which dictates that a company’s future success is inversely correlated to the grandiosity of its home office. A few years ago, super-investor Marc Andreessen published a list of 10 signs a company is ripe for a fall. No. 7: “Pouring huge money into overly glorious new headquarters.” This principle is why no Sears employees are still in what used to be Chicago’s Sears Tower. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week But there is a more profound reason to believe Apple could be culled from the Big Five: data. Data, as pundits like to say, is the new oil. Companies with the most data will win. Sucking Up Data Data make a company’s machine-learning software get smarter so that the company can better serve customers and vacuum up more market share. Think of Amazon’s recommendation engine or the way the Google search algorithm constantly hones itself. As a company wins share, it pulls in yet more data, and the machine-learning software keeps getting smarter, further distancing the winning company from the also-rans. That spiral is why we’ve wound up with a handful of tech giants that boast a combined market value greater than the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom. Related: How AI will cure America's sick health care system The top five companies might appear to be in different businesses—hardware, search, software, retail, social media—but in fact they are competing fiercely against one another for one thing: data. Whenever you use any of their products or services, you are giving them data and making them smarter. So a primary factor in the future success of these companies is whether they can soak up more and new kinds of data about you and the world at large. An aerial view of the new Apple headquarters on April 28, 2017 in Cupertino, California. Apple's new 175-acre campus dubbed "Apple Park" was designed by Lord Norman Foster and cost roughly $5 billion. Justin Sullivan/Getty Alphabet, the second-most valuable company after Apple, operates a mind-boggling web of data-collecting services. It starts with Google’s 90 percent share of search, which acts like the company’s real-time ticker showing what the planet’s population is interested in right now. (In May, Google Trends showed a sudden spike in searches for “Richard Nixon.” Wonder why.) Add to that Google’s Chrome browser, Gmail, Google Docs, YouTube, maps, calendars, photos and Android, which runs 80 percent of the world’s smartphones and tracks a ton of data about each user. Alphabet is to data collection what a humpback whale is to krill. Facebook knows a side of you that Google doesn’t—your social interactions and, thus, a lot about your personality. It has about 2 billion active users globally, and that’s not counting WhatsApp, Instagram and whatever the company will do with Oculus virtual reality. Facebook is also becoming the world’s most powerful news service, so its software can learn about events and public sentiment from billions of clicks, likes and shares. Amazon sucks up more data than any other company about consumer habits, while Amazon Web Services (AWS)—the cloud-computing juggernaut—gives Amazon a window on how data are being used by thousands of startups and big companies such as Netflix, which host their operations on AWS. Now Amazon is betting its Alexa gadgets can become our ever-present personal assistants in the cloud, gathering data about our lives along the way. And Microsoft? Yeah, it’s more boring than the others, but it’s entrenched in the world’s business operations with Windows, Office, server software and cloud computing. Corporations would grind to a halt without PowerPoint. Much of that software gives Microsoft ways to soak up more data about how we work than any competitor except maybe Google. Can Apple Catch Up? That brings us back to Apple. Yes, we love its hardware, and we will keep buying iPhones and MacBooks and iPads—though even Apple’s hardware prowess is getting a little humdrum. The introduction of a new iPhone model used to generate goosebumps. Now the anticipation for the iPhone 8, to be unveiled in the fall, feels about on the level of excitement for a new model Chevy Camaro. More important, Apple seems to be in a data-collection corner when competing against the other four giants. Its crown jewel—the iPhone and iOS—accounts for just 20 percent of smartphones, which means Google gets the data from the other 80 percent of smartphone users. Apple has no search, no social network, no significant online retail operation, no cloud services. All its productivity software ranks behind similar products from Microsoft and Google. Apple’s Siri, once the star of commercials with John Malkovich, has fallen behind Alexa and Google’s voice services in the race to be our digital assistants. Related: Will AI robots turn humans into pets? Meanwhile, Facebook, Google and Microsoft are investing heavily in virtual reality and seem to be well ahead of Apple. Even iTunes, which once funneled vast amounts of data about media habits to Apple, has turned into a technological laggard behind the likes of Netflix, Spotify, Amazon streaming services and Google’s YouTube. In just about every avenue for collecting data, Apple has been beaten. And because, in the era of machine learning, data relentlessly increases the gap between the winners and losers, it’s hard to see how Apple can catch up to Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. Selling cool hardware that we all need will be a good business for a long time, just as selling cars or refrigerators can be a good business. But when it comes to inventing the data-driven, machine-learning future, four of the big five seem to be in a better position, while one is moving 12,000 employees into a steel-and-glass wheel that sports a 100,000-square-foot fitness center with a two-story yoga room that, as Wired reports, is “covered in stone, from just the right quarry in Kansas, that’s been carefully distressed, like a pair of jeans, to make it look like the stone at [Steve] Jobs’s favorite hotel in Yosemite.” Not every high-flying company tanks after building luxury digs, but it’s happened enough that people notice. Silicon Graphics built a huge campus at its peak, then abandoned it to a rising Google in 2003. MySpace signed a 12-year lease worth $350 million in Los Angeles in 2008, as Facebook loomed on its horizon. AOL Time Warner started building a massive home in the middle of New York in 2000, just before the stock collapsed and the merger got labeled one of the worst deals ever. Apple is packed with brilliant people who may surprise us with some wondrous new thing that leaves other companies far behind. It also has nearly $260 billion in cash—enough to buy General Electric, AT&T or Anheuser-Busch InBev. (Apple Beer!) But it’s just as likely that the new Apple campus will eventually seem like a monument to a great run that culminated in an $800 million market cap the moment the moving vans pulled up out front.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Vivek Wadhwa By Vivek Wadhwa May 31 at 11:04 AM Follow @wadhwa A visitor plays chess against a robot during a COMPUTEX event in Taiwan on May 30. This year’s COMPUTEX focuses on artificial intelligence and robotics as well as virtual reality and the Internet of things. (Ritchie B. Tongo/European Pressphoto Agency) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing so rapidly that even its developers are being caught off guard. Google co-founder Sergey Brin said in Davos, Switzerland, in January that it “touches every single one of our main projects, ranging from search to photos to ads … everything we do … it definitely surprised me, even though I was sitting right there.” The long-promised AI, the stuff we’ve seen in science fiction, is coming and we need to be prepared. Today, AI is powering voice assistants such as Google Home, Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri, allowing them to have increasingly natural conversations with us and manage our lights, order food and schedule meetings. Businesses are infusing AI into their products to analyze the vast amounts of data and improve decision-making. In a decade or two, we will have robotic assistants that remind us of Rosie from “The Jetsons” and R2-D2 of “Star Wars.” This has profound implications for how we live and work, for better and worse. AI is going to become our guide and companion — and take millions of jobs away from people. We can deny this is happening, be angry or simply ignore it. But if we do, we will be the losers. As I discussed in my new book, “Driver in the Driverless Car,” technology is now advancing on an exponential curve and making science fiction a reality. We can’t stop it. All we can do is to understand it and use it to better ourselves — and humanity. Rosie and R2-D2 may be on their way but AI is still very limited in its capability, and will be for a long time. The voice assistants are examples of what technologists call narrow AI: systems that are useful, can interact with humans and bear some of the hallmarks of intelligence — but would never be mistaken for a human.  They can, however, do a better job on a very specific range of tasks than humans can. I couldn’t, for example, recall the winning and losing pitcher in every baseball game of the major leagues from the previous night. Narrow-AI systems are much better than humans at accessing information stored in complex databases, but their capabilities exclude creative thought.  If you asked Siri to find the perfect gift for your mother for Valentine’s Day, she might make a snarky comment but couldn’t venture an educated guess. If you asked her to write your term paper on the Napoleonic Wars, she couldn’t help. That is where the human element comes in and where the opportunities are for us to benefit from AI — and stay employed. In his book “Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins,” chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov tells of his shock and anger at being defeated by IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer in 1997. He acknowledges that he is a sore loser but was clearly traumatized by having a machine outsmart him. He was aware of the evolution of the technology but never believed it would beat him at his own game. After coming to grips with his defeat, 20 years later, he says fail-safes are required … but so is courage. Kasparov wrote: “When I sat across from Deep Blue twenty years ago I sensed something new, something unsettling. Perhaps you will experience a similar feeling the first time you ride in a driverless car, or the first time your new computer boss issues an order at work. We must face these fears in order to get the most out of our technology and to get the most out of ourselves. Intelligent machines will continue that process, taking over the more menial aspects of cognition and elevating our mental lives toward creativity, curiosity, beauty, and joy. These are what truly make us human, not any particular activity or skill like swinging a hammer — or even playing chess.” In other words, we better get used to it and ride the wave. Human superiority over animals is based on our ability to create and use tools. The mental capacity to make things that improved our chances of survival led to a natural selection of better toolmakers and tool users. Nearly everything a human does involves technology. For adding numbers, we used abacuses and mechanical calculators and now spreadsheets. To improve our memory, we wrote on stones, parchment and paper, and now have disk drives and cloud storage. AI is the next step in improving our cognitive functions and decision-making. Think about it: When was the last time you tried memorizing your calendar or Rolodex or used a printed map? Just as we instinctively do everything on our smartphones, we will rely on AI. We may have forfeited skills such as the ability to add up the price of our groceries but we are smarter and more productive. With the help of Google and Wikipedia, we can be experts on any topic, and these don’t make us any dumber than encyclopedias, phone books and librarians did. A valid concern is that dependence on AI may cause us to forfeit human creativity. As Kasparov observes, the chess games on our smartphones are many times more powerful than the supercomputers that defeated him, yet this didn’t cause human chess players to become less capable — the opposite happened. There are now stronger chess players all over the world, and the game is played in a better way. As Kasparov explains: “It used to be that young players might acquire the style of their early coaches. If you worked with a coach who preferred sharp openings and speculative attacking play himself, it would influence his pupils to play similarly. … What happens when the early influential coach is a computer? The machine doesn’t care about style or patterns or hundreds of years of established theory. It counts up the values of the chess pieces, analyzes a few billion moves, and counts them up again. It is entirely free of prejudice and doctrine. … The heavy use of computers for practice and analysis has contributed to the development of a generation of players who are almost as free of dogma as the machines with which they train.” Perhaps this is the greatest benefit that AI will bring — humanity can be free of dogma and historical bias; it can do more intelligent decision-making. And instead of doing repetitive data analysis and number crunching, human workers can focus on enhancing their knowledge and being more creative. business on-innovations innovations Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Android O update for OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T confirmed: When will you get the latest firmware? OnePlus founder and CEO Pete Lau has announced that OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T will receive Android O update. Raymond Ronamai   May 31, 2017 20:46 IST OnePlus 3IBTimes India/Sami Khan Google had launched the second developer preview of its latest operating system Android O at its recently concluded Google I/O event. The company is yet to announce when it will be made available to the public, but Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus has confirmed that its popular handsets OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T will receive the Android O update. The search giant's new operating system Android O has some impressive features like Fluid Experiences and machine learning tool TensorFlow Lite, and cool tools including Picture-in-Picture, Smart Text Selection, Auto-Fill and Notification Dots. Also read: How will OnePlus 5 differ from OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T? OnePlus founder and CEO Pete Lau has announced on Twitter that the company's flagships -- OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T -- that were released last year will get Android O update. However, he didn't reveal the tentative date for the arrival of the new operating system. A lot of you have been asking, so I'm proud to say Android O will come to OnePlus 3 and 3T.— Pete Lau (@petelau2007) May 31, 2017 The first developer preview of the Android O was released to a few Google handsets a few weeks before the second preview was rolled out at the Google I/O event. The third preview is expected to be released in mid-June and the fourth in mid-July before the final version is rolled out in the third quarter of this year, perhaps in August. It may be noted that OnePlus 3 was released running Android Marshmallow operating system before it got the Nougat update. It features a 5.5-inch Full HD Optic AMOLED display with 1,920x1,080 pixels (401 ppi pixel density), a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor, a 64GB internal memory (no microSD card slot), and a 6GB RAM.
