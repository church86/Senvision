Developers have been able to use an early version of the software since March. But over the coming weeks, the final iteration of Android 7.0 Nougat will be making its way to the Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9, Nexus Player,Pixel C, and General Mobile 4G, which is part of Google’s Android One program. Any device enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also get the update, while LG’s V20 will be the first phone to come with the software out of the box when it debuts later this year. Android 7.0 Nougat brings several upgrades to Google’s mobile software, including 72 new emoji characters, the ability to open more than one app at the same time in separate windows, and support for Google’s mobile virtual reality platform, called Daydream, among other additions. Google says there are 250 new features in total. Google doesn’t typically allow developers to access the beta version of its new Android software so far ahead of its release. This year, however, the company gave app makers a longer lead time so they could optimize their software for the new platform closer to its official launch. Because Android is open source and available across a wide range of products made by different manufacturers, the wait for a new software update can sometimes take months depending on which phone you own. When Google releases a new version of Android, it must be approved, and, in some cases, modified by handset manufacturers and carriers before it arrives on your phone. This is why updates don’t reach all Android devices at the same time, as Apple’s iOS updates typically do for iPhones. The fact that Google has granted earlier access than usual to its beta program this year suggests it’s trying to expedite the rollout process moving forward.

Google has started rolling out their latest version of their mobile OS, Android 7.0 Nougat, to Nexus users all over the world. This comes almost two months after we learned the name of the OS and over 5 months since the first developer preview of what was then Android N came out. We’ve seen plenty of features surface through the five developer previews of Android Nougat Google released, like multi-window support, new emojis, an improved way of interacting with notifications, a redesigned Quick Settings pane, an improved lock screen, and plenty of stuff found under-the-hood. If you wanna know everything new inside Android 7.0, check out the list below. Expanded emoji: There are now over 1,500 different emoji built into Android, including 72 new ones, so go ahead: express yourself. Quick Settings controls: Quick Settings gives you easy access to things like bluetooth, WiFi and the all-important flashlight. With Android Nougat, you can actually control what tiles go where, and move ‘em around to fit your needs. Multi-locale support: Apps can tailor their content based on your locale settings. So if you speak multiple languages, for instance, then search engines can show results in each of those languages. Multi-window: Run two apps side-by-side. The windows are resizable, too, by simply dragging the divider. Direct Reply: Reply directly to notifications without having to open any app. Bundled notifications: See what’s new at a glance with bundled notifications from individual apps. Simply tap to view each alert. Notification controls: When a notification pops up, just press and hold to toggle the settings. For instance, you can silence future alerts from an app in the notification itself. Lockscreen wallpaper: You can now have different wallpapers on your device’s homescreen and lockscreen. Improved Settings navigation: Find the right setting faster with an updated navigation menu in Settings. Quick Switch: Switch between your two most recently used apps by simply double tapping the Overview button. Vulkan: Games will now leap to life thanks to high-speed, next-generation graphics — all powered by your device’s multi-core processor. Daydream: Android Nougat is ready to transport you to virtual worlds with Daydream-ready phones, headsets and controllers — all coming later this year. Seamless updates: New Android devices with Nougat can install software updates in the background which means you won’t have to wait while your device installs the update and optimizes all your apps for the new version. And for current Nexus users, software updates now install much faster, so you won’t have to wait for minutes while your device reboots. File-based encryption: Android Nougat can better isolate and protect files for individual users on your device. Direct Boot: Direct Boot helps your device startup faster, and apps run securely even before you unlock your device when your device reboots. Improved system backup coverage: More device settings are covered by Android Backup, including accessibility settings, run-time permissions for apps, Wi-Fi hotspot settings and Wi-Fi network restrictions. Work mode: Work mode allows you to turn on and off your device’s work apps and notifications for a better work, life balance. Display size: Not only can you change the size of the text on your device, but the size of all the display elements like icons and images. The Nexus devices to receive Android Nougat are as follows: Nexus 6P Nexus 5X Nexus 6 Nexus 9 Pixel C Nexus Player General Mobile 4G (Android One) Each of these devices will receive the update over the air, while any devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program will automatically receive the final version of Nougat via the same method. Interestingly, Google has confirmed over on the official Android Nougat webpage that the first phone to ship with Android 7.0 will be the LG V20. Of course we already knew this, but it’s nice to hear it straight from the horse’s mouth, if you will. Unfortunately, the Nexus 7 and LG’s Nexus 5 handset will not receive Android Nougat, meaning the latest update for the devices is Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Of course, this makes plenty of sense since the devices were released back in 2013 (the Nexus 7 even had a version of itself made in 2012), however it’s still sad since the devices are so popular. Nonetheless, we’re gonna miss the Nexus 5 and 7 around here. Rest in peace, old friends. To see if you’ve received Android 7.0 Nougat yet on your device, head over to Settings > About phone > Software Updates. If you do have the update, be sure to have at least 80% battery life and a good, stable Wi-Fi connection before installing. Otherwise, you may have serious problems with the installation process.

Share Tweet Share Tags : LG-LG+ Android-Android+ Deals-Deals+ Google-Google+ We're as excited as anyone at the prospect of new Nexus smartphones, particularly given the numerous leaks we've had so far regarding Marlin and Sailfish. But the other great aspect of a prospective handset roll-out is that older devices become considerably cheaper. The Nexus 5X, for example, has been gradually dropping down in price over the last couple of months, and right now, can be had for the miserly sum of $200 on eBay.  While by no means a high-end handset, the Google Nexus 5X has occupied that oh-so-familiar space just below the cutting-edge of the market. Admittedly, since it's now a year old, the likes of its Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor and 2 GB of RAM seem decidedly meager compared with other strong mid-rangers. But if you can see past the numbers, you may realize that the Nexus 5X was and is great all-round performer, and a genuine steal at 200 bucks.  In our Google Nexus 5X Review, we were most impressed with the device's versatile 12-megapixel camera, good display and snappy overall performance. Sure, you don't get expandable storage, and the plasticky design really isn't much to write home about. But as aforementioned, it's hard to pick too many faults with a handset that now costs just $200 new, particularly since it's a Nexus.  For, yes, the small matter of Android 7.0 Nougat now upon us. Even though the Nexus 5X on offer ships with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, buyers should have little trouble updating since the LG-made smartphone is among the early beneficiaries of the sweet new flavor. The eBay deal from seller mobilepros1 offers the Nexus 5X new and unlocked for GSM networks in the choice of Carbon (read: black) or Quartz (white) color options.  Even though it's aging, the Nexus 5X still has enough going for it to serve as a daily driver, though could readily be utilized as a backup or secondary phone to those in search of an understudy.  If you'd like to grab the device at this very agreeable price of $199.99, hit up the source link below.  The Google Nexus 5X in pictures Popular galleries Careful: this video link will crash your iPhone!

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Software updates-Software updates+ Android 7.0 Nougat started its official rollout today, but that isn't the only Android update news to be had. It turns out that Google is planning to be more structured with how it releases software updates going forward, although it is still unclear whether this structure and consistency will trickle down to Android manufacturers as well. According to Google's vice president of engineering, Dave Burke, Android Nougat will be set on a new quarterly maintenance schedule. In fact, Google has already begun working on the first maintenance update for Nougat, which will be released as a developer preview "this fall." Burke doesn't say specifically, so it's unclear if the developer preview and the first quarterly maintenance update will both be released this fall or if the developer preview will come in the fall and the final version in the winter quarter.  The claim also isn't made by Google that this will in any way speed up how quickly updates are pushed to non-Nexus devices, but moving to a more structured and consistent schedule complete with developer previews may have an effect. At the very least, it could make it easier for Google to draw up a map of the slowest OEMs and carriers when it comes to updates, which Google has been rumored to be considering. Either way, it sounds like Google wants a better schedule, and Burke also said the first bug patch for Nougat will be out soon.  source: Android Developer Blog Featured stories   LG V20 camera tips and tricks   When will my phone get Android 7.0 Nougat?   Best high-end Samsung smartphones you can get right now (November 2016)   iPhone 7 Plus vs $1600 camera: which takes better portraits?   Nokia's return to smartphones confirmed for 2017   Bezelless Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8?

Speaking of which, these android updates aren't responsible for speed increases with OEMs using custom skins but I'd trade some fluidity for features as I kinda hate how plain vanilla Android is (Moto Z is almost vanilla, and I like Sense best with Touchwiz being not too far inn2nd). posted on 22 Aug 2016, 22:19 4 in response to #3 in response to #3 Hide Reply 4. joey_sfb (Posts: 5946; Member since: 29 Mar 2012) There you have it it's either snappy performance or features rich. I would rather just get the plain Nexus and download Novo Launcher Prime into it. This way my interface experience would be consistent regardless of phone manufacturer. Another problem I have with OEM skin is that they like to drop in and remove features at they own wimp. Each phone generation would need users to get adjusted. That's not very user friendly. For iOS user moving to Android just get Nexus their interface change is minimal each generation. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 22:24 3 in response to #4 in response to #4 Hide Reply 5. kiko007 (Posts: 3077; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) I think HTC foes a good job with their skin. It has stock elements, and there's no lag to be found. So Nexus and HTC phones if I were to completely switch. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 22:28 1 in response to #5 in response to #5 Hide Reply 6.

I wanted to go with the HTC 10 but decided to give the Moto Z Force a try and ended up keeping it. I still miss the Sense widgets and how it looked but maybe next time. posted on 23 Aug 2016, 01:27 2 in response to #7 in response to #7 Hide Reply 10.

Stockish but with tweaks...Nougat has the double tap to switch back to the previous app but Oxygen has already implemented a tap and hold the back button for the previous app with OP3.

So it depends on what changes are made and what people are asking for. iOS may be simple on the surface but getting to the other settings requires some digging. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 23:56 0 Reply 9. johnnyboy (banned) (Posts: 55; Member since: 16 Aug 2016) Even with these updates, android remains underdeveloped and unstable! posted on 23 Aug 2016, 03:35 0 Reply 11. maple_mak (Posts: 516; Member since: 18 Dec 2013) Congratulation on getting banned, outdated iSheep! posted on 23 Aug 2016, 07:08 0 Reply 12.

Share Tweet Share Tags : T-Mobile-T-Mobile+ LG-LG+ Android-Android+ Google-Google+ Starting today, August 22, Android 7.0 Nougat is officially rolling out, but only to the Pixel C convertible tablet and select Nexus devices - including the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, and Nexus Player. While no one is surprised to see that Google's own devices are the first to be updated to Nougat, this year, things are different when it comes to the very first phone to run the new version of Android out of the box. This won't be a Nexus, but the upcoming LG V20. Of course, LG already announced that the V20 would come with Nougat pre-installed, and now Google reconfirms this by "introducing the LG V20" as "the first new smartphone that comes with Android Nougat, right out of the box." The V20 is mentioned over at the official Android 7.0 Nougat website, and perhaps "introducing" is an exaggerated term, as Google doesn't actually show the handset, nor does it mention anything else about it besides what's quoted above. Still, we can catch a glimpse of the V20's Nougat UI, though this is (unsurprisingly) not too different from the Android Marshmallow UI that we're familiar with from the LG G5. The LG V20 will be officially unveiled on September 6, and could be released later next month in the US, possibly costing $649 off contract. According to rumors, the V20 should feature a modular design, a dual rear camera, fingerprint scanner, and Qualcomm's powerful Snapdragon 820 processor. LG says that the new handset can offer "the best video and audio experience", but we'll see about that. source: Android.com Related phones LG V20 Specifications News (61) Review 8/10 User Reviews (3) 9.7/10 Discussions (0) Photos Size it 360° Manual V20 Related News   T-Mobile is giving away free flagship phones like the Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with a trade   Freedom Mobile to launch LTE network in Canada on November 27   Best Android phones you can buy right now (November 2016)   LG V20 sales surpass 200,000 units in the US   HTC Bolt vs LG V20 vs Google Pixel XL: our size and specs comparisons show you how these stack up   LG V20 tips and tricks 24 Comments Follow Following Options Close Always view all comments Show comments: default hide low rated show moderated comments Display mode: Threaded Chronological Newest first Save posted on 22 Aug 2016, 17:07 5 Reply 1.

The G5 was a disappointment, which is not all that surprising. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 17:24 4 Reply 3. wargreymon (Posts: 732; Member since: 05 Nov 2013) I wouldn't mind a module system, but it has to be done better, no restart, no visible hole, more robust. If V20 had that I could accept it, but preferably I would like an updated V10. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 17:36 6 Reply 5. JC557 (Posts: 1561; Member since: 07 Dec 2011) Hot swapping should have been priority so that the phone doesn't need to be shut down every time you want to change out a module or extend battery life. I would make an exception for battery swapping but maybe it could have a backup onboard battery to allow battery hot swapping but it would be complicated and can die before the phone gets replaced. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 20:55 3 in response to #5 in response to #5 Hide Reply 16. Hoggington (Posts: 315; Member since: 23 Feb 2016) You'd think they could engineer a tiny permanent backup battery, that would be just enough to keep the phone on while swapping modules.

They should of built off the V10 design and iron out any boot loop bugs. Not sure if V10 had these but a lot of the G4's did.

From Monday, the system update will be sent out to Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C, and Android One users, with Google saying it'll take "several weeks" to get the code fully deployed. As for other manufacturers, it's up to them when they push out the new operating system. Based on past experience, don't hold your breath – although it looks as though LG will get the first bite. "The Nexus and Pixel C update to Android 7.0 Nougat occurs in stages and some carriers will receive the update later than others," Google said. "This update will be pushed simultaneously to devices in the Android Beta Program." Under the hood Google says Nougat has 250 improvements, the most noticeable of which is the user interface that allows two resizable app windows to run side by side. Improved multitasking support deep in the OS makes this possible. Notifications have been updated, and can now be answered without firing up the app they are aimed at. The settings page allows pinning of most-used-and-needed apps within easy swiping distance. For those of a virtual bent, Nougat is the debut for Google Vulkan 3D graphics API, which will form a key part of Android's Daydream VR app. Forthcoming Nougat phones with high-refresh rate screens and faster chips can run virtual apps while clipped into a headset – similar to the Gear VR system – and this'll give Google some virtual traction while we wait for Magic Leap. Security has scored a major update, hardening up the Linux kernel at the heart of Android by segmenting off memory sectors and sandboxing some from user data entirely. Stack buffer overflow protection systems have been hardened, restricting the use of perf functions and SELinux ioctl system calls to developer mode only. Nougat also fixes issues with Snapdragon-powered phones that allow an attacker to exploit flaws in the Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment to potentially harvest the smartphone's encryption keys. Multiple hacks have shown this to be a serious issue and security testers will be examining how the final implementation works. Goodbye old Nexii Sadly, the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 fondleslabs won't be invited to the Nougat party. Google guarantees Android updates for two years and the Nexus 7 passed that in July. The Nexus 5 ought to be good until October, but sources tell The Reg that it doesn't have the hardware chops to run the new operating system. It's unlikely that support for the new operating system will be added later, so Marshmallow is the end of the Android road for these devices, officially at least. Google has provisionally set a limit of three years for the all-important security updates, so they'll still be safe to use for the moment, and it's possible they could extend its deadlines to avoid leaving a growing pool of infected systems out there. Mind you, that's not going to stop people trying to manually add Nougat to the older kit.

We won’t keep you waiting for the new emoji available, here they are, direct from Google’s blog post: All the new emoji included on Android 7.0. (click to see larger image, courtesy of Google.) Other than emoji, Android 7.0 users will also be able to natively run two apps side-by-side on their smartphones, resizing the windows by dragging a split-screen divider. Samsung previously introduced a multi-window function to its Galaxy devices via its TouchWiz UI layer on top of Android, but now any new Android device will be able to perform this function. And iOS users might be familiar with another new feature to Android 7.0, Direct Reply. It allows you to reply directly to notifications – like responding to an incoming message, by typing into a small window at the top of your device, without having to open a new app. Quick Switch is another short-cut feature, letting you quickly flip back and forth between your two most-recently used apps. Google says it’s also improved the battery-saving “Doze” feature to drop your smartphone device into low power mode when it’s being gently jostled around in your bag while you’re moving. A series of security updates will also be benefitting Android 7 users, such as the new “Seamless updates” to install software updates in the background instead of requiring you to wait for the installation to complete and reboot. File-based encryption has been improved to better isolate and protect files for individual users. Direct Boot promises to boot your device up faster, and have apps run securely in the background before you unlock your device upon reboot. It's official! #AndroidNougat starts rolling out today on select #Nexus devices (5X, 6, 6P, 9 and Pixel C). https://t.co/jJsMMxvAia — Android (@Android) August 22, 2016 As with all Android updates, Nexus-branded devices will get first access to Nougat. Other devices will be dependent on manufacturer and carrier schedules for pushing out the update. Also expect several new devices to launch in the last quarter of 2016 running Android 7.0.

However it seems that Google is not stopping there, nor are they planning on slowing down. In a post on the Android Developers blog, Google announced that the next major update to Android 7.0 is already in the works. In fact it seems that developers already expect to check out a preview of the update come this fall. According to Google, “We’re moving Nougat into a new regular maintenance schedule over the coming quarters. In fact, we’ve already started work on the first Nougat maintenance release, that will bring continued refinements and polish, and we’re planning to bring that to you this fall as a developer preview. Stay tuned!” While this is just speculation on our part, it does seem rather coincidental timing of the next major update and also the launch of the Nexus devices, which last we heard was set for a launch in October. However we have also heard the rumors that Google could have their own Google-branded handsets that might debut next month, so we’re not sure if they are one and the same or if they are different. Either way we guess we’ll keep our eyes peeled for more information, but in the meantime if you own the newer Nexus handsets, with the Nexus 6 being the oldest (sorry Nexus 5 owners!), do check out the update when you can!

It’s been a long run, and we’ve had more good times than I can remember, but it’s over. We knew the end of support for the Nexus 5 was coming, but with today’s release of Android Nougat, it’s officially over. Earlier this year, Google published a schedule for how long current devices would continue to be supported, and when the company would stop guaranteeing updates. The Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 (2013) are both on that list, with a couple more devices coming up around the corner. Google has maintained that any Nexus device would continue to receive updates for at least 2 years after it was made available on the Google Store. After those 2 years are up, it’s done-zo. This doesn’t mean that the device won’t continue to receive Android Security Patches, as Google has promised up to 3 years of support for those, so you can continue to run Android Marshmallow and be secure. The next two devices that will see their life cycles come to an end are the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9, which were both released in October of 2014. While still able to get all the great things that come with Android Nougat, it may be time to hang up the cleats soon.

According to the Android developers blog, Google is working on moving Android to a regular maintenance update cycle over the next few quarters.

The release announced Monday means many Nexus-branded devices should receive a free upgrade to Android 7.0, nicknamed "Nougat," during the next few weeks. The first models in line include the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G. Other smartphones coming out this fall will be sold with Nougat already installed. The new version of Android has been in a testing phase since March as Google polished the system that will feature 72 new emojis and the ability to reply to notifications without opening an app. Rival Apple is scheduled to release the latest operating system for the iPhone next month.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Google begins offering tasty Android Nougat to Nexus devices by Bruno Ferreira  3:45 PM on August 22, 2016 Android development at Google has been going on at a steady clip. The computing giant has begun the rollout of Android 7.0, codename Nougat, to recent Nexus devices worldwide. Google calls Nougat the "sweetest release yet," so here's a quick run-down of how it will improve the taste of your mobile experience. Both performance and battery life should prove superior in comparison to Marshmallow, thanks to under-the-hood improvements. Multi-tasking support is now an official OS feature, and supports both windows and split-screen modes. Android's notifications and Quick Settings panels are top-notch already, and Google saw it fit to improve them further still. The new Display Size feature is rather neat: it tells the OS to visually scale everything to the user's taste—not just text. On the gaming front, there's now Vulkan support on tap, as well as the VR-oriented Daydream software platform. If you use your Android device for business purposes, though, you'll be happy to learn about the new Google for Work features. On the technical side, there's a new JIT compiler, seamless OS updates thanks to a dual-partition scheme, and file-based encryption. Oh, before we forget, there's a ton of new emojis. Very important.   Users of Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, and Pixel C devices can enjoy the tasty Nougat right away with a simple over-the-air update. However, Google seems to be following the quick deprecation path treaded by its partner OEMs by dropping support for the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 devices. Neither of those has yet had its third birthday, and to our eyes this seems a questionable move, especially considering that Apple's upcoming iOS 10 will support devices as old as the iPhone 5, which came out in September 2012.   On a more positive note, Google says that it is "moving Nougat into a new regular maintenance schedule over the coming quarters." Hopefully this can translate into more frequent updates. Reviews of the new operating system are already circling around the internet, too, and the overall feedback is positive.   However, there's a huge mechanical elephant in the room. As of today, only 15.2% of Android devices worldwide are running Android 6.0, thanks to OEMs and carriers' unwillingness to offer software updates to any device that's older than, uh, about 24 hours. Android Nougat's release doesn't seem likely to improve this situation.

These are the Huawei Nexus 6P, LG Nexus 5X, Motorola Nexus 6, HTC Nexus 9, Asus Nexus Player, Google Pixel C, and General Mobile 4G. The release comes a little more than a month after the final Android 7.0 Developer Preview became available, keeping with Google's revamped timeline this year. Since the company is doing things differently in 2016, there are no new Nexus devices becoming official today. Doze on the Go in Android 7.0 Nougat As is usually the case with Android system updates, the rollout of Android 7.0 should take weeks to complete, so don't panic if your beloved Nexus isn't showing an update notification in the next ten minutes. Devices that are currently running the Developer Preview will be updated too, by the way. The expanded emoji and customizable Quick Settings in Android 7.0 Nougat Android 7.0 Nougat brings with it the ability to set multiple locales and languages, 72 new emoji, multi-window functionality, a way to quickly switch to the previous app (by double-tapping the multitasking button), the Vulkan graphics API, a dedicated VR mode, Doze on the Go for even better battery life when you're on the move, custom Quick Settings, direct replies from notifications, bundled notifications, a built-in mobile data saver, file-based encryption, and much more. For a full list you can check out Google's official page for this release.

Ahead of fall smartphone season, Google releases Android 7.0 update USA TODAY 8/22/2016 Eli Blumenthal NEW YORK—There’s a new Android desert ready to be devoured.  Popular Searches Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 67.69 -8.30 -10.92% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.91 -0.89 -0.80% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 775.96 -9.37 -1.19% Urban Outfitters Inc URBN ▼ 35.41 -3.61 -9.24% On Monday, Google announced its flagship Nexus line of phones will be among the first to get their hands on the latest and greatest version of the company’s Android operating system, version 7.0 Nougat. First released to developers in March before its official unveiling in June, Google says Nougat brings “over 250 major features” to Android. Among the notables: 72 new emojis, the ability to run two apps side-by-side, improved battery optimizations and interactive notifications.   New, high-end phones being released in the future with Nougat will also be able to take advantage of Daydream, Google's virtual reality platform due to launch later this year. Google says the update will start rolling out to users of the Nexus 6, 5X and 6P smartphones, Nexus 9 and Pixel C tablets and the Nexus Player streaming box over the coming weeks. The General Mobile 4G, a smartphone taking part in Google’s Android One initiative to create cheaper Android devices for international and emerging markets, will also be included in the initial rollout. Google usually upgrades its Nexus line, devices that it creates in tandem with manufacturers to highlight new Android features, first. Unlike the Samsung Galaxy S7 or LG G5, the Nexus devices don’t include software from the manufacturers or wireless carriers making them simpler and quicker to update.    As is the case with biggest Android updates, the latest flagship devices from Samsung, LG and others will also likely get the update at some point in the future, but manufacturers have not disclosed which devices will get the update or when. The process varies by manufacturer and can take anywhere from days after the update is available for Google devices, to weeks and in some cases, months.  The update comes as smartphone makers prepare to launch their latest line of devices for the fall. This past Friday, Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7, while Apple is rumored to announce the next iPhone on September 7. LG has an event scheduled for September 6 to announce the LG V20, the first phone to come with Android Nougat out of the box. Google, meanwhile, is said to be prepping two new Nexus devices with HTC. Those phones are set to be released later this year.  Follow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From USA TODAY America has healed before — or have we?

Detailed on their blog, Google will be doing things a little different this year when it comes to the usual “dot” (.X) releases. You know, those smaller updates that roll out after a full version jump (e.g., Android 5.0, 5.0.1, 5.1, etc.). The new approach will see Google moving to a regular maintenance schedule — outside of the monthly security updates — over the coming quarters. Although they haven’t committed to a specific timeline, it sounds like it could arrive quarterly. This new approach will get these new Android versions into the hands of developers sooner, with them arriving as part of the Developer Preview. Apparently Google has already begun work on the next version of Android 7.X Nougat update and says it will be available this fall for developers or willing testers. They haven’t detailed what will be added, but you can expect the usual “refinements and polish,” with the likelihood of new smaller features to arrive as well. It’s actually a smart way to make sure everyone is up to speed on Android updates, and something that could help get Android updates out the door a little quicker.

New data from a job recruiting startup doesn’t paint a promising picture for women in tech. Equal Pay Day began 20 years ago by the National Committee on Pay Equity, and while there has been acknowledgment and improvement of the gender disparity in Silicon Valley, the tech industry still has a long way to go. Women in tech make 3 percent less than men Job recruiting startup Hired released new data on its findings of equal pay in Silicon Valley, and found that companies on average offer women 3 percent less than men for the same roles — some offering as much as 30 percent less. These jobs aren’t only in tech-related fields, but also in sales and marketing. Related: Study suggests women’s computer code is preferred, only if their gender is unknown “Sixty-nine percent of the time, men receive higher salary offers than women for the same job title at the same company,” according to the data. Of course, larger companies are under greater scrutiny, and many of the big-names in tech do offer equal pay. Facebook and Microsoft disclosed information surrounding equal pay after facing pressure from an investment firm, Arjuna Capital. The firm filed a shareholder proposal in 2014 asking for nine companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, to release salary data, according to the Wall Street Journal. So far, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Intel have disclosed pay data to the firm, and Expedia says it will in October. “We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure pay equity, and have done so for many years,” Facebook’s Head of Human Resources, Lori Goler, said in a Facebook post. “We complete thorough statistical analyses to compare the compensation of men and women performing similar work. I’m proud to share that at Facebook, men and women earn the same.” Google told Digital Trends that its People Analytics team analyzes performance, compensation and promotion to ensure that there is no gender pay gap at Google. “Since we set salaries based on the market rate of the job (rather than a person’s pre-Google salary), we find that, on average, women get larger pay increases than men when they join Google,” a spokesperson said. While Facebook, along with Google’s parent company, Alphabet, say they offer equal pay, both companies have not disclosed salary data to the firm yet, according to the Wall Street Journal. Women in the U.S. at Microsoft now earn 99.8 cents on the $1 earned by men at the same job title and level. And Microsoft went further and disclosed how much other ethnic minorities make compared to their Caucasian counterparts. “Racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. combined earn $1.004 for every $1 earned by their Caucasian counterparts,” Microsoft’s Executive Vice President of Human Resources, Kathleen Hogan, said. “Breaking it down even further, African American/black employees are at $1.003; Hispanic/Latino(a) employees are at 99.9 cents; and Asian employees are at $1.006 for every $1 earned by Caucasian employees at the same job title and level, respectively.” It’s still mostly an all-boys club But offering equal pay is the easy part — what about the number of women who are actually working at these tech companies? Related: Vimeo to fund five female-directed films this year to help close gender gap The Menlo Park company provided an employee breakdown last May, which shows that only 16 percent of Facebook’s global tech workforce comprises of women with tech-related careers. Microsoft’s also only has a small group of women in its tech workforce — 16.9 percent, as opposed to the other 83 percent that are men. Based on its 2015 data, only 18 percent of Google’s tech jobs are held by females. And Apple is hardly any better — the Cupertino company’s tech workforce is 22 percent female, according to its 2015 data. One thing’s for sure — these industry leaders have realized the gender disparity in their workforce and have spoken out about it. “We believe in equality for everyone, regardless of race, age, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a diversity report. “That applies throughout our company, around the world with no exceptions.” Related: Just because Ellen Pao isn’t appealing her lawsuit loss doesn’t mean the struggle for gender equality is over Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly mentioned the importance of a more diverse workplace, but also how more women will help teams perform better, according to CNN. “It’s this problem because it’s not even clear where you would start attacking it,” Zuckerberg said in a 2014 Q&A. “You need to start earlier in the funnel so that girls don’t self-select out of doing computer science education, but at the same time, one of the big reasons why today we have this issue is that there aren’t a lot of women in the field today.” That was in 2014 — and Facebook’s most recent data from less than a year ago only improved by 1 percent. While Google’s disclosure of diversity in its workplace in 2014 may have inspired a wave of companies like Apple and Facebook to follow suit, it’s equally important for these industry leaders to follow through with actions. Last year, companies like Google and Intel announced new initiatives to help create a more gender-balanced workplace. Google pledged $150 million and Intel created a $300 million fund for the next five years. We’ll have to see how these initiatives play out, but hopefully a higher awareness will have more companies hiring more women and other minorities in tech-related fields, while offering the equal pay for equal work.

An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes.More >>    By Cristian de Looper Provided by Google is constantly going through antitrust lawsuits in Europe, but it seems like the company may once again have to deal with them stateside. The FTC is reportedly asking questions about whether or not Google is abusing its dominance in the search market, suggesting that the agency may be looking to reopen an investigation that was closed three years ago. According to a report from Politico, which cites “sources close to the matter,” antitrust officials at the FTC have been in talks with executives at “a major U.S. company that objects to Google’s practices.” Despite the fact that talks seem to be in their early stages, the reports do show that perhaps Google isn’t done with antitrust lawsuits just yet. Related: Competition for Alexa? Chirp may be poised to bring ‘OK Google’ to the home Of course, as mentioned, Google is facing antitrust trouble in Europe. The European Commission filed an antitrust complaint against Google’s mobile operating system, Android, back in April, and is reportedly considering another case into Google search. Critics of Google suggest that the company has unfairly been using its dominance in search to promote its own products and push links to competitors’ products lower on the results page. While some argue that Google is entitled to do this if it wants to, others suggest that it undermines the fact that many view Google as a neutral path into the internet. It’s important to note that just because the FTC is investigating doesn’t mean any action will be taken — the agency regularly investigates issues that it never pursues. Still, the news could end badly for Google, despite the FTC voting 5-0 to close a lawsuit against the company in 2013. Thankfully for Google, it doesn’t seem as though it will have to face two lawsuits in North America — an investigation into its search and advertising was just closed in Canada.   This article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by Can't Find Something? 3933 Washington Road Augusta, GA 30907 (706) 650-5400 FCC Public File publicfile@wfxg.com (706) 650-5400 EEO Report Closed Captioning Texas News Now All content © Copyright 2000 - 2016 Raycom Media.

At first glance, it appears to be a Google Maps vehicle, maybe on a break, but University of Pennsylvania computer and information science professor Matt Blaze noticed two automated license plate recognition (ALPR) cameras on the roof. Blaze took a picture and tweeted it with the comment “WTF,” according to Motherboard. The immediate question that came to mind was, whose vehicle is it, and why does it have Google Maps decals? ALPR cameras scan, track, and send license plate and vehicle data to a computer, which in Philadelphia can be stored up to a year. Because ALPR can effectively track an individual’s movements without a warrant, they’re considered controversial. According to ELSAG North America, a company that makes ALPRs and possibly the units in Blaze’s photo, “Generally speaking, License Plate Readers (LPRs) can record plates at about one per second at speeds of up to 100 mph and they often utilize infrared cameras for clarity and to facilitate reading at any time of day or night. The data collected can either be processed in real time, at the site of the read, or it can be transmitted to remote center and processed at a later time.” Related: Oops! Google Maps error leads to wrong house being demolished The Philadelphia police department has been open about using the scanning technology since 2011, so the question remained about ownership and why it had the decals. Google was contacted, but Google spokesperson Susan Cadrecha said, “We can confirm that this is not a Google Maps car, and that we are currently looking into the matter.” Philadelphia fleet manager Christopher Cocci confirmed that the city owned the SUV. Cocci said it was not a state police vehicle, but that he thought it was used by law enforcement. After contacting the Philadelphia police, Motherboard received the following response later the same afternoon: “We have been informed that this unmarked vehicle belongs to the police department; however, the placing of any particular decal on the vehicle was not approved through any chain of command. With that being said, once this was brought to our attention, it was ordered that the decals be removed immediately.” The department also said it was investigating the use of the labels. So the question remains as to why the labels were used, but the surveillance camera SUV ownership inquiry, at least, is resolved.

Or rather, your driverless car. Google is hiring $20-per-hour “vehicle safety specialists” for its self-driving car testing in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler,  as reported in The Arizona Republic. According to the job listing, the job with Alphabet Inc., which owns Google, requires a Bachelor’s degree, clean criminal and driving records, and the ability to type at least 40 words per minute. The jobs will call for six to eight hour days, five days a week, under 12- to 24-month contracts. Testers will work in teams of two per vehicle, one behind the wheel to take over if necessary. The other tester will sit in the passenger seat with a laptop documenting the testing and submitting reports. The “passenger” needs to focus constantly on a range of software systems and give Google engineers concise written and oral feedback. Google’s Self-Driving Car testing program head of operations Brian Torcellini said, “Test drivers play an important role in developing our self-driving technology. They give our engineers feedback about how our cars are driving and interacting with others on the road, and can take control of the vehicle if needed.” While the overall purpose of the positions, besides preventing the cars from causing any harm, is to collect data for the engineering teams, it’s easy to see that this job could become the beginning of a career path. Autonomous car development is ongoing around the world, but on-road testing and documentation, using technology and reporting tools and systems that both are bound to grow in sophistication over time, could quickly fill a resume. It’s important to note, however, that specific details must be kept confidential. Occasional travel for up to a month at a time may be required for Google self-driving car vehicle safety specialists, so if you’re not tied down, that could work in your favor as well. “The role of test driver is so new that there isn’t a particular type of person that we look for,” Torcellini said. “We’ve hired people from all types of backgrounds, from English teachers to orbital welders. In general, they need to be excellent drivers who pay really close attention to the road and can predict the social aspects of driving. Local drivers will be great for testing in the Phoenix area because they know the roads and local driving norms better.”   This article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by Can't Find Something? 3933 Washington Road Augusta, GA 30907 (706) 650-5400 FCC Public File publicfile@wfxg.com (706) 650-5400 EEO Report Closed Captioning Texas News Now All content © Copyright 2000 - 2016 Raycom Media.

An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes.More >>    By Bruce Brown Provided by When people talk or write about smart homes, one of the first brands mentioned is Alphabet’s Nest, and its famous thermostat, but if you’re thinking about “smartening up” your home, you may want to know that Nest’s future is uncertain. On June 3, parent company Alphabet announced that Nest’s CEO Tony Fadell is moving to an advisor role. Worse, Nest may not be part of the Alphabet family for long, according to Ars Technica.   When Google acquired Nest in early 2014, all signals were “go” for growth and brand dominance. The expectation was that Google would develop new technology to strengthen Nest’s foothold and make it the premier platform for connection and control in the still nascent smart home market. Certainly the list of devices and apps that are compatible with Nest from other smart home technology companies has grown since 2014, but Alphabet might be souring on Nest. Nest’s spending binge, and lack of products Inside Alphabet, opinions on Nest’s performance do not seem enthusiastic. Since its purchase by Google, Nest has grown from about 280 employees to approximately 1,200 today. Nest has spent more than half a billion dollars in acquisitions: $550 million on webcam manufacturer Dropcam plus an unspecified amount for smart home hub company Revolv. Dropcam’s co-founder Greg Duffy, who is leaving Nest, said Nest was given an unlimited budget. Related: A boatload of additional products are about to ‘Work with Nest’ Yet, despite a thousand new employees and half a billion dollars spent, Nest has no new products. The Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Protect smoke detector aren’t new, though they have been updated, and the Nest Cam is a re-branded Dropcam. This has all been during a time when public awareness of smart home technology has grown — even if consumers aren’t exactly sure what it’s for, according to The Harris Poll. Google/Alphabet is a company that develops technology and products on a world-class level. In 2015 Google was awarded 2,835 patents, putting it at number five on the list of the top tech companies, wrote Fortune. To put that in perspective, IBM won 7,355 patents during the same year, nabbing it the top spot for the 27th consecutive year. Google is no slouch. It stands to reason that an important division with no new products coming to market would stand out within the company, and not in a positive way. Google shuns the Nest division It is also telling that the Nest division wasn’t involved in the development of Google Home, released to take on Amazon Echo as a premier home system voice control device. You’d think that Nest would develop Google Home, or at least be part of the progress, but it didn’t work out that way. Ars Technica reports that Nest staff found out about Google Home after it was already in planning. When Nest asked to be part of the development, their request was denied. Nest was also not involved with developing the Google OnHub home networking router. Significantly, OnHub even has some of the security features of a product code-named “Flintstone” that Nest had developed for three years before finally killing it. Troubles with Nest Morale at Nest has reportedly been slipping. In a meeting in November 2015, Tony Fadell stopped Nest co-founder Matt Rogers who was expressing concern about employees leaving the company. Fadell said those who left were from Google or Dropcam and that employees not happy with the way things were going should “step up” and not “take on a victim mentality,” adding that victims “are not long for the world,” according to The Information. Nest didn’t gain consumer confidence in mid-2014 when the Nest Protect smoke detector was recalled, either. It was discovered that a feature called Wave, by which you could silence an alarm with a wave of your hand, could also be enabled by those waving for help during a fire. Nest put the smoke detector back on the market with the Wave feature disabled, which caused some to complain about false alarms that couldn’t be hushed. Related: Ford demonstrates smart home integration at CES 2016 In earlier 2016 when Nest announced it was going to shut down the servers for the Revolv smart home hub, which didn’t thrill Revolv hub owners, the company eventually decided to refund the Revolv purchase price to everyone who bought it. The Nest name will live on The new CEO of Nest is Marwan Fawaz who has a background in security systems and also was the leader of Motorola’s Home business when it was sold to Arris. Whether his role is to finally get the “Flintstone” security product to market or manage a transition of Nest to another home is up for speculation. The viability of Nest as a brand is not in question. Nest’s brand recognition and communications connections with other smart home products mean it’s likely to continue as a major player. Whether or not it stays in the Google/Alphabet family, however, is less certain. Does that mean you shouldn’t buy a Nest Thermostat? Not necessarily, the device connectivity and IFTTT (If This Then That) scripts using Nest aren’t going away soon. But with the current leadership turnover and mixed reports on Nest’s performance as a member of the Alphabet family, big changes or pivots could come for the brand. And uncertainty is never fun when you’re paying hundreds of dollars for a new home device.   This article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

Android 7.0 Nougat Starts Official Rollout to Nexus Devices GO Nougat comes with over 250 major features Aug 22, 2016 20:45 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Rumors from a few days ago stated that Google would begin global rollout of Android 7.0 Nougat today and it seems that they were right. Google has just announced that it began global rollout of Android 7.0 Nougat to all Nexus devices and Pixel C. On a post on the official Android Blog, Google developers stated that Android 7.0 Nougat comes with over 250 major features and highlighted some of them. Back in March, Google provided developers with the opportunity to take a sneak peek at Android N, a first for any new Android version. Google stated that Android 7.0 Nougat is more personal, in the sense that it comes with more ways for users to customize their phones. It comes with expanded emoji, Android now contains over 1,500 different emoji, including 72 new ones. In addition, Android 7.0 Nougat allows users to arrange tiles in any way that they wish, including shortcuts for Bluetooth, WiFi and flashlight. It comes with multi-locale support, which would let apps provide content based on settings set on the smartphone, including browsers to show results in those languages. Android 7.0 Nougat comes with bundled notifications Android 7.0 Nougat comes with multi-window support, which allows users to run two apps side-by-side and the windows are resizable. As expected, Direct Reply is also available in the new OS version and users can switch between recently used apps with just the tap of a button using the Quick Switch feature. Bundled notifications feature is also included in the final version. Doze mode has been improved with Android 7.0 Nougat, the device can drop into lower power usage when the user is on the move. Android 7.0 Nougat comes with support for VulkanTM for advanced 3D rendering and Daydream. Back in May, Google did announce that Android 7.0 Nougat will be focused on security also and the release seems to confirm just that. Android 7.0 Nougat is able to install updates in the background and use file-based encryption. Direct Boot will allow users to startup their devices faster and run apps securely. Google announced that the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One), together with devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program, will receive the final version.

News Albania Startups Investment Commentary Events Stories Calendar Newsletter More Tech Mobile Business Marketing Interviews Books           News Albania Startups Investment Commentary Events Stories Calendar Newsletter More Tech Mobile Business Marketing Interviews Books About us Advertise Contact   By: Leonit Ibrahimi Business How to validate your startup idea 2016-08-22 You have these many ideas in your head but you don’t know if customers would like them or not. How to validate your startup idea? How do you know if it will work? This article highlights necessary steps that you need to take to validate your idea.    Entrepreneurship is hard and it’s a long journey, and only a few get lucky enough to succeed the first time, while some do a lot of hard work to get to a so-called “overnight sensation”. It took 20 years to create an overnight success out of Pokemon Go for John Hanke, the creator of a game that is breaking all records in the app world. His journey started in 1996, when he co-created the very first MMO, then continued in the year 2000 with  ‘Keyhole’ ,  a way to link maps with aerial photography, and create the first online, GPS-linked 3D aerial map of the world. In 2004 Google bought Keyhole and with John’s help, turned Keyhole into what is now ‘Google Earth. Pokemon Go   That’s when John decided to focus on creating GPS-based games. John ran the Google Geo team from 2004 to 2010, creating Google Maps and Google Street View. During this time, he collected the team that would later create Pokémon Go. In 2010, John launched Niantic Labs as a start-up funded by Google to create a game layer on maps. In 2012, John then created Niantic’s first geo-based MMO, “ingress” and in 2014, Google and the Pokémon Company teamed up for an April Fools’ Day joke, which allowed viewers to find Pokémon creatures on Google maps. It was a viral hit and got John thinking the idea could be turned into a real game. John decided to build Pokemon Go on the user-generated meeting points created by players of Ingress, and the most popular became the Pokestops and gyms in Pokemon Go. John raised $25 million from Google, Nintendo, the Pokemon Company and other investors from Dec 2015 to Feb 2016 to grow a team of 40+ to launch Pokemon Go in 2016. John and his team launched Pokémon Go on July 6th in USA, Australia, and New Zealand. Since its launch, the app has generated over 1 billion dollars from in-app purchases.   How to validate your startup idea It started as an April fools joke, yet it turned out to be a great method to validate the product. People went crazy for it and they wanted it to be true. That was the right moment for John Hanke to push the product forward. The lessons learned from this process are certain stages that an entrepreneur passes, including idea, connections, hard work and prototyping to validate. This means that you get to know what others say and understand that if you’re the only one who truly thinks your idea is good, then it’s time to reiterate and go through the process again. A great tool to use for validation is the free Validation Board from Lean Startup Machine, which helps you test your startup idea without wasting time or money and make faster decisions, improve team accountability and build better products.   Prototyping The prototype, also known as the MVP or Minimum Viable Product, helps you understand how customers behave around your product. The goal of it is to prove that your concept works, in the easiest, quickest and most affordable way possible. As a startup, you know that getting your product to market fast is key, and your prototype is the shell that makes the first step towards full functionality. If it’s a hardware product, check your competition for insights to save time and money, while if it’s an app or web app try using something like invision, freelancers or similar tools for prototyping. Don’t put too much energy into it. Make it as simple as possible because you’ll iterate and this will help you understand your customers better and make it easier to explain your product to people. If needed, reiterate again.   Hypothesis When you have the idea and the prototype you can move towards forming a hypothesis for customer problems and solution, which takes you more towards the the path of how to validate your startup idea. The hypothesis should sound something like: How will your idea specifically solve the problem you identified? A rule of thumb is to determine what 20% of features will satisfy the other remaining percent of customers. Such a minimum feature set will form the basis for part of the Delivery phase. On the other hand, the solution hypothesis includes details around Product Features, Product Benefits, Intellectual Property, Product Delivery, and Schedule. When you form a list of 40-70 potential target customers (using mailchimp or something else to collect emails) that somewhat fit your customer brief, you have to find out ways to reach out your customers and spread awareness through the most effective channels. The ones you target, must be willing and be able to be your customers. If they’re unaware then your launch might not be successful and you end up with having a great solution for a big problem, but without no deal to complete. These people also define your target market, because they’re affected by the problem you’re trying to solve and they can quickly become paying customers. When you reach out 1:1, trying to ask questions that go beyond a yes and a no.   Analyzing After you go through this process, you gather the data, document the results and analyze the necessary information on how to validate your startup idea. This means that whatever assumptions you might have had, you get the chance to iterate and make your prototype better until you’re ready to go full scale. On the other hand, you can also end up like Dropbox, handcraft a demo (without actual working, releasable software); post it; orient the messaging to the early market; promote it and see what happens. They got substantial traffic on the video and sign-ups for product information, which meant excellent pre-release validation. That’s one great way on how to validate your startup idea.

Microsoft offers cash reward if you switch to its new Edge web browser Incentive aims to boost popularity of Internet Explorer replacement By KATHRYN CAIN 22nd August 2016, 9:54 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments IN a bid to boost the popularity of its new web browser, PC giant Microsoft is offering CASH for people who switch over from Google Chrome. Microsoft rolled out its latest Windows 10 update last July including its Edge browser to replace its ageing Internet Explorer software – but so far it has proved to be flop. Reuters 2 Microsoft is offering a cash reward for people who switch to its Edge browser from Google Chrome Since the launch last year many users have shunned the new browser, instead sticking with Google Chrome which continues to be the most popular choice as according to San Francisco-based firm Quantcast Google accounts for a whopping 70 per cent of activity from Windows 10. As a result the computer giant is trying to tempt users over to Edge with a cash reward, reports the Daily Star. Those who sign up to Microsoft Rewards, currently only available in the US, will be given points for using the browser depending on how long they spend using it each day.

Microsoft will monitor how much time you spend using the minimalist browser, with users required to hit 30 hours a month. The US technology firm will also watch your mouse movements to make sure you’re using the browser properly and not tricking the system. And one more thing, you have to set Bing as your default search engine. Getty Images 2 It launched Edge last year but so far it has failed to be as popular as Google Chrome The news of the cash incentive comes just as Microsoft launches its latest big update for the Windows 10 operating system which includes updates to Edge including improved power usage, making it more energy efficient compared to its competitors. Edge will also now allow you to immediately go to any URL address you post in its search bar with a nifty new “search and go” function, and will also be able to show the full history of any tab just by right-clicking the back button.

Android Nougat's new side-by-side multi-window mode is perfect for tablets, but works quite nicely on big phones too. More like this Android 7.0 Nougat -- when your phone will get the upgrade Android 7.0, Nougat: The complete FAQ Android 7.0 Nougat -- what you need to know Video Add-ons elevate new Moto Z phones Red alert, Nexus owners: Google has announced it’s begun rolling out Android 7.0—that’s yummy, decadent Android Nougat—via over-the-air updates. The first devices to get the new operating system will be the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Nexus 6 phones, as well as the Nexus 9 and Pixel C tablets. The new OS will also arrive on the Nexus Player media streamer, as well as the General Mobile 4G—that’s the Android One phone sold in Europe. Like all new Android releases, expect the Nougat roll-out to take a few weeks, with some carriers moving more quickly than others. Top-line Nougat features include a new multi-window mode for app multitasking; better control over Quick Settings and recent apps; direct reply in notifications; and 72 new emoji. (Don’t lie: You come for the multitasking, but stay for the emoji). There are also some behind-the-scenes improvements for power management, gaming performance, and security. You can learn more here on Google’s Nougat page; Google says there are more than 250 improvements. We've compiled a list of some of our favorite new features. Also make sure to check out our take on the six Nougat features to try first. In Nougat, you can customize exactly which settings appear in your Quick Settings menu. It’s these little quality-of-life improvements that make Nougat so tasty. We’re told there are no “big differences” between the upcoming public release of Nougat and the last Developer Preview of Nougat that may already be loaded on your Nexus device. And, in fact, if you’re running the Developer Preview, it will automatically receive the OTA update. If you’re not currently using one of the latest Nexus phones and don’t have any plans to buy one, you can consider waiting for LG’s V20, which arrives this September with Android Nougat built right in. The V20, slated for its official reveal on September 6, will feature dual front-facing cameras (for varying fields of view), manual video controls, and a 32-bit digital-to-analog audio converter. But for now, Android Nougat is all about Nexus devices. That’s just how the Android universe works. The impact on you: This is why you buy Nexus devices—to get Google’s latest version of Android before all the poor saps stuck with Samsung, LG, HTC, and Sony phones. And if you don’t have a Nexus phone, then be prepared to wait months and months—or never—to enjoy all the new Nougat features. We keep a list of the most current information about when prominent phones are going to get Android Nougat. The side-by-side app multitasking will be especially useful on Google’s Pixel C tablet, but I’m excited to try this on my 5.7-inch Nexus 6P as well. Beyond that, Nougat is packed with a bunch of little quality-of-life features, like the ability to toggle between your two most recently used apps with a double-tap of the Overview button, and customization control over which settings appear in your Quick Settings Menu.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Advertise Google is Not a Search Engine, According to European Union News  SEO April 4, 2016 News SEO Matt SouthernApril 4, 2016 SEJ STAFF 1.4KSHARES 12.6KREADS 1.4KSHARES 12.6KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 1.4KSHARES 12.6KREADS According to legislation adopted by the European Union, Google is not considered to be a search engine. It took the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union two years of negotiations and legislative process to come up with this decision. The decision will also declare that Bing, Yahoo and DuckDuckGo are not search engines either. Here are the details of the story, with credit to ERDi who first reported on it. Why is Google not a Search Engine? According to the EU’s agreed upon definitions, a search engine searches all websites, which Google does not. Google does not search and/or index the dark web (Tor), nor does it search pages which it is directed not to by a site’s robots.txt file. The fact that Google complies with Right to Be Forgotten requests, and removes content such as revenge porn, also disqualifies it as a search engine by the EU’s definition. So What is a Search Engine? There is currently no search engine in existence today which matches the definition laid out by the EU’s Directive on Network and Information Security. ADVERTISEMENT “Online search engine’ is a digital service that allows users to perform searches of in principle all websites or a geographical subset thereof, websites in a particular language on the basis of a query on any subject in the form of a keyword, phrase or other input; and returns links in which information related to the requested content can be found.“ The key phrase “of in principle all websites” is technically what disqualifies all search engines as we know them today from being search engines by the EU’s definition. Perhaps one day EU will get its wish, but for now search engines are what they are, and they’re a far cry from what EU believes they should be.   Featured Image Credit: jorisvo / Shutterstock.com Related Posts European Union Files Third Anti-Trust Charge Against Google European Union to Carry Out Probe into US Tech Companies, Including Google European Parliament To Call For Separation Of Google Search From Other Services The Vote Is In: European Parliament Is In Favor Of Breaking Up Google Bio Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Latest Posts Matt Southern Lead News Writer at Search Engine Journal Matt Southern has been the lead news writer at Search Engine Journal since 2013.

See our policy here.   Styleincraft It’s a creativity site.thanks for sharing.. Richard So even if Google qualified as a search engine by all the other criteria… “The fact that Google complies with Right to Be Forgotten requests” Following a law that the EU created would keep Google from being a search engine? Seriously?? Trying to think of a good word to describe how stupid that is and failing….. Lord Diamond google is a propaganda engine. not search engine. anyone interested in non biased results need search elsewhere. google shows you what’s currently most popular, not what’s most important. this means news sites full of fake/zionist bs. also google personalization sticks you in a little bubble and once you click on a popular bs site then its stuck in you personalized world view from then on. and all you shills out there: don’t even start with me on “how its your choice, you can just open you settings and figure out how to turn it off”, yeah right, you expect the majority of people to go do that. the thing should work right out of the box! Fabrico Montini Google is my favorite search engine, but this days its more of a online store then a search engine John Smith I can see that this decision by the EU was on the top of the EU’s things to do list. Two years to make the decision, WTF SaycoRa In UE carrot can be a fruit,snail can be a fish so why google could not be a search engine… Selena E. Shields google is the most used engines in the world. but why could it not be e search engine.. Jordan That’s like saying a plane isn’t a plane because it spends a lot of its time on the ground… Kyle Eggleston Typo in the second paragraph. Kelsey Jones Thanks Kyle. I just fixed it. Kelsey Jones It is a little confusing, I agree! Stoney deGeyter So basically, according to the EU, they have created a classification not only for something that doesn’t exist but for something that can’t exist, due to the right to be forgotten laws. #brilliant ittabena Interesting. Doesn’t really impact anything, but interesting. Bruce Bates I find it amazing how many of your readers are trusting what you say in thi article. There was NO RULING made about google at all. Did anyone actually download the PDF and see what this was really about? obviously not! The word Google doesn’t even appear in the ruling at all. This is nothing more than a non-qualified person taking it upon themselves to interpret what was mean by a rules… and then twissting that inpretation by applying it to a company like google. Sad. … on a completely different not… actually google is not a search engine, its an advertising company that offers a search engine as one of many features. Patrick Buntsma Of course the word “Google” is not mentioned in it. The EU will never pass a bill mentioning any company name. How dumb can you be to assume that?! It doesn’t take a genius to read the required guidelines to qualify as a search engine and compare them to Google’s policy to notice that Google will not comply with it. Bing, Yahoo and Yandex are not mentioned in the ruling either. According to your narrow mind that would mean this ruling will not apply to them either. Wake up! Bruce Bates Actually your last staement was my point, its NOT about google, its about bing, yandex, google, yahoo, and many others…. why single google out like its the big bad of the equation? Mary Burrell Why could it be? Still confusing … Mobil Mindz Indeed! nice blog. May be European countries face issues in their search result through google. But google should work on it. When as a user you are searching something it should show you entire thing on website. Little confusing for me too !

This will be done with the Android Beta Program, allowing users with a variety of Google’s Nexus devices to sign up for and download the newest version of Android at any given time. Google has to release said version of Android, of course – and today, that means Android 7.0 Nougat in its full, final form. There’ll be more updates to Nougat down the road, of course – this is just the first non-developer-only-aimed version of the software. Users that wish to participate in the Android Beta Program have only to head to the Android Beta Program page. There, the user will be asked to agree to a set of rules. The following is the most important part of this agreement: “The updates that you’ll receive as a part of this program are pre-release versions, and may contain errors and defects that can affect normal functioning of your device.” This bit matters less today than it did the last several releases. This is because this version is a full release rather than a developer version or a Maintenance Release. The Android Beta program will not work for every single different Android device in the universe. Devices that are eligible for the Google Android Beta program from this point forward are as follows: • Nexus 6 • Nexus 9 • Nexus 5X • Nexus 6P • Nexus Player • Pixel C • General Mobile 4G (Android One) Users of the Sony Xperia Z3 can work with Sony’s N Developer Preview program – but at this point we’re not certain they’ll be bringing this final version to the public. We’ll see! Today also marks the release of the Android 7.0 source code to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). As Google suggests, continuing this tradition is important for the broader Android ecosystem – open source around the world.

Google says that they’re “moving Nougat into a new regular maintenance schedule” over the next several quarters. The first maintenance update that’s part of that schedule is already being worked on, and Google says that it’ll be pushed as a developer preview sometime this fall. As for what’s included in the update, Google didn’t get specific, but they did say that it’ll bring “continued refinements and polish.” It might sound kind of weird that Google has announced a maintenance update for Android 7.0 before most folks have even gotten Nougat, but there are always people working to improve Android with stability and performance improvements. Google has already started work on polishing parts of Nougat that need it, and they’ll continue to tweak and improve the software in the coming days as it hits millions of regular users and they discover any issues that Google and their developer testers may have missed.

Google will end support for Chrome applications on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms over the next two years. Starting in early 2018, users of packaged and hosted Chrome apps will no longer be able to run them on these platforms. Google will, however, continue to support all types of Chrome apps on Chrome OS for the foreseeable future, a company executive announced Aug. 19. In a blog post, Google Vice President of Product Management Rahul Roy-Chowdhury said the decision was prompted by the fact that many of the capabilities offered by Google apps are now available natively in popular browsers. Google launched Chrome apps in February 2013. The apps are based on web technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript and CSS but open outside the browser just like regular, native applications on different platforms. The browser-based apps are designed to give users a way to do things like use web applications and send push notifications even when offline. Since the launch of Chrome apps, however, developers have increasingly integrated similar capabilities within the browser itself, Roy-Chowdhury said. And with more similar capabilities continuing to become available on the web, the time has come to discontinue Chrome apps on all non-Chrome OS environments, he said. Starting later this year, any new Chrome apps that are developed will be available only to Chrome OS users. All existing Chrome apps, however, will continue to work across all currently supported platforms. Developers will continue to have an opportunity to update and upgrade them. Starting in the second half of 2017, Chrome apps for Windows, Linux and Mac environments will no longer be available on Google's Chrome web store. But extensions and updates will still be available to current users of the apps on non-Chrome platforms. Starting in early 2018, however, such users will no longer be able to run apps on their devices. "All types of Chrome apps will remain supported and maintained on Chrome OS for the foreseeable future," Roy-Chowdhury said. "Additional enhancements to the Chrome apps platform will apply only to Chrome OS devices, including kiosks." Software developers will continue to be able to build Chrome applications for Chrome OS desktops and other systems. Meanwhile, developers who have built Chrome applications for Windows, Linux and the Mac platform are being encouraged to move their applications to the web. Developers unable to move their applications fully to the web could work with Google in identifying and prioritizing new APIs to make up for Chrome apps that will no longer be available on other platforms, Roy-Chowdhury said. "In the short term, they can also consider using a Chrome extension or platforms such as Electron or NW.js," he said. Google began the process of phasing out support for Chrome apps in non-Chrome environments earlier this year. In March, Google said it was getting rid of the Chrome app launcher for users of Chrome apps on Windows, Linux and Mac systems. The launcher enables Chrome apps to be launched outside the browser. Because a majority of users prefer to open the apps from within Chrome itself, having a separate launcher is unnecessary, Google had noted at that time.           LATEST ENTERPRISE APPS ARTICLES   MapR Launches Analytics Package Backed by Data Scientists Why Microsoft Picked SAP SuccessFactors for Its HCM Needs Microsoft Releases First Office Online Server Update IBM Introduces Industry-Specific-Watson Internet of Things Services Paint 3D Added to Windows 10 Creators Update Build                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Google has announced plans to released the latest version of its Android software. Reuters Google has announced that the new version of its Android software will be released to customers in the "coming weeks". Android Nougat was previewed by Google earlier this year, and includes a raft of new features. Google begins rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to Nexus devices today, but before it is released to the wider public, here is what to expect: Expanded emoji Nougat features an expanded emoji library of more than 1,500 of the animated icons, including 72 new designs. Multi-window Users will be able to run two apps side-by-side on their phone or tablet, with the two windows both resizable by moving the divider between the two, enabling better productivity, Google says. Google begins rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to Nexus devices today. PA Wire Quick switch The updated operating system enables users to jump instantly between their two most recently used apps by double-tapping the overview button - the square icon on the left of the three navigation buttons that appear at the bottom of the screen. Doze This battery-saving feature uses sensors built into an Android phone to detect when the device is not being used, and cuts power consumption. The updated version has been extended so Doze can still identify when a phone is idle even when it is moving around in a user's bag or pocket. File-based encryption This new feature encrypts and protects files or folders individually as opposed to being encrypted as a whole. Nougat's other new feature, Direct Boot, takes advantage of this feature to speed up the unlock time of a phone by starting to launch some apps securely even before an unlock code is entered.

Here are the key features for business users. By Conner Forrest | August 22, 2016, 11:36 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: CNET On Monday, Google officially rolled out Android 7.0 Nougat to some Nexus devices. The update brings useful tools for business users who rely on an Android device to get work done. Like all recent Android updates, Android 7.0 is coming to newer Nexus devices first. That means current generation devices like the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, and the Pixel C should be receiving over-the-air (OTA) updates starting Monday, August 22, with others to follow. If you want to know more about Google Nexus, check out our Smart Person's Guide on the program here. So, when will your phone get the update? That's difficult to say, because non-Nexus devices require the OEM to sign off on it before releasing it to users. Based on this helpful timeline of what happened with the Android 6.0 release, compiled by Android Authority, the best-case scenario might be a month or two, but you could end up waiting around five months or more. Interestingly, Google also announced a new device coinciding with the release of Nougat. The LG V20 will be the first device released running Nougat right out of the box. Although no specific release date was given, Google said it is "coming soon." SEE: BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy Template (Tech Pro Research) Google released the first alpha quality Android N Developer Preview on March 9, 2016. The OS was officially announced at the 2016 Google I/O developer conference, and saw a few public betas before its Nexus release on Monday. Now that it is here, albeit slightly ahead of Google's usual schedule, Android Nougat brings some functionality that could help all compatible Android phones be more competitive in the business world. For starters, Android for Work is getting Work Mode, which Google said "allows you to turn on and off your device's work apps and notifications for a better work, life balance." In theory, it will be easier to unplug on vacation or over the weekend.

With Nougat, also, OS updates will download in the background, making it easier to stay up-to-date—a key step in keeping security strong. Notifications are getting improvements with bundled notifications, so users can view all notifications from a specific app as a bundle. You will also now be able to reply to notifications directly from the notifications shade. One of the biggest productivity improvements is split-screen mode. Devices made by certain companies like Samsung, Apple, and Windows have split-screen capabilities already, but a system-level support for the features in Android will go a long way to making Android a more welcome OS among professionals. Still, these features won't solve all of Android's problems. Fragmentation is still a huge issue, with roughly 15% of users currently running Android 6.0 Marshmallow a full year after its release. At the time of this writing, about 35% of users were running some version of Lollipop and almost 30% were still on KitKat. Additionally, despite making numerous advances in security recently, Android is still dealing with a host of major issues like malware, some of which are affecting millions of devices. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Android 7.0 Nougat is officially rolling out to new Nexus devices like the Nexus 6, 5X, 6P, 9, Nexus Player, and the Pixel C, as of August 22, 2016. Nougat brings a host of updates that will improve its use among professionals, such as security updates, split-screen capabilities, and a Work Mode function. Despite the novelty of Android 7.0, the Android ecosystem still has to deal with the same issues of fragmentation and slow OEM releases that have plagued other releases.

Here's where it stands now and how users can protect their devices. By Scott Matteson | August 22, 2016, 11:19 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: TechRepublic/Jack Wallen Operating system vulnerabilities are commonplace these days, and one of the most notorious examples is Stagefright. TechRepublic writer James Sanders named it one of the top five security vulnerabilities of the past year. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter What makes Stagefright so formidable? It involves a flaw in a common Android video playback library (libstagefright) which permits a buffer overflow when playing MPEG4 video files. This overflow can then provide an attacker with ability to run malicious code using escalated privileges, and all it takes is a specially constructed multimedia text message to exploit the vulnerability. The Stagefright discovery sent a shockwave through the entire mobile ecosystem last year. As delays in security updates made headlines, the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission got involved. While Google has invested heavily in improving Android's security since then, patches do little good if they fail to reach end-users. Unfortunately, this is often the case thanks to Android's fragmented update process that relies on phone manufacturers and carriers to deploy updates. Adding to this problem, the adoption rates of new versions of Android is very slow, with only 13.3% of devices running Android Marshmallow (6.0) since its release nearly one year ago. If this trend continues, Android Nougat will only be used on roughly the same number of devices this time next year. This concerns us because outdated devices will not benefit from a majority of the improvements Google has made in response to research related to multimedia processing. I spoke with Joshua Drake, zLabs VP of Platform Research and Exploitation at Zimperium, who discovered the vulnerability about what's happened since then. Do you know if anyone has exploited the Stagefright vulnerability? "To our knowledge it has not been exploited in the wild." What's particularly concerning about Stagefright? "The most dangerous aspect is that these vulnerabilities do not require any user interaction to be exploited. Attackers only need a victim's phone number to remotely execute malicious code on a device via a specially crafted media file delivered via MMS. Unlike spear-phishing, where the victim needs to open a PDF file or a link sent by the attacker, this vulnerability can be triggered without user-interaction, even when a victim is away from their phone. Before they can tell anything has happened, the attacker is able to remove any signs of the device being compromised by simply deleting the infected message and the victim will continue their day as usual - with a trojaned phone." To address the delays and issues associated with the propagation of Android patches, Zimperium formed the Zimperium Handset Alliance (ZHA). How is it working out and what advances has it made? "The Zimperium Handset Alliance (ZHA) is an association of different parties interested in exchanging information and receiving timely updates on Android's security-related issues. Our goal in creating this coalition was to address the key concerns that arise in the smartphone security ecosystem. More than 25% of the largest Android device OEMs and wireless carriers have joined the ZHA and made great strides in improving the patch deployment process. However, the fact still remains that many users will never receive the updates they need to be fully protected." Can you provide some specifics on how Google assisted with remediating Stagefright? "After Stagefright was discovered, Google moved swiftly to provide a security patch and update its Hangouts and Messenger apps to remove automatic media processing. It also introduced monthly Android Security Bulletins, with other vendors (including Samsung and LG) soon following suit." What are the current statistics involving Stagefright? Does it remain mitigated for the devices which were patched against it? "Stagefright has impacted nearly 1 billion Android devices total and in the past year, Google has patched 107 libstagefright/mediaserver related vulnerabilities. But despite these patches, there are an alarming 850 million devices that are still vulnerable as of March 2016." What are your top three best practices for mobile security? "Our most important piece of advice is to always update your phone as soon as a software update becomes available. Too many people opt to ignore updates, which leaves their phone vulnerable to cyber criminals. Mobile device users should also avoid using public Wi-Fi and should adjust the settings on their smartphone so that it doesn't automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks. Finally, the default security settings on your smartphone are not enough. If you're serious about keeping your data safe from known and unknown threats, protect your device using a third-party security system." Are there any other similar threats looming? "As previously stated, since discovering the initial Stagefright vulnerability last year, Google has patched 107 libstagefright/mediaserver related vulnerabilities, meaning there are many similar threats at large which can be mitigated via these patches. But because of Android's fragmented security system, most users have not received the patches necessary to be protected and are still vulnerable to these threats." Do you feel Android is more secure than iOS, or vice versa? "I don't necessarily think one OS is more secure, but there is a perception that iOS is more secure and, I don't believe iOS is as secure as many people believe. The spotlight on Android has created the impression that iOS security is superior; however, Apple's ability to instantly push software updates is losing value. Updates are only effective if users take the time to install. The latest App Store numbers show that 29% of iOS users are running on old and outdated versions unnecessarily exposing themselves — and their company's sensitive data — to hackers." Do you feel any manufacturers or carriers are more secure than others? "Carriers and handset manufacturers that provide timely updates are more secure. The reverse also applies. For instance, Motorola recently stated they will be unable to keep up with monthly updates and will provide updates in larger, less timely batches." Anything else to share with the readers? "A year ago, we knew the Stagefright vulnerability was alarming, but we could have never anticipated the reach and impact it continues to have. While we still have more work to do, we're incredibly thankful to Google and to the many manufacturers and carriers who have taken steps to make our mobile ecosystem safer."

More like this 20 great new features in Android 7.0 Nougat 5 hidden Android Nougat features you should be using Android N: 5 features we love in the new OS Video Google Daydream View unboxing: A first look at Google's VR headset The moment you've been waiting for since the announcement of the original beta is here, Android faithful.  Though you’re likely still getting used to uttering its name, Android 7.0 Nougat has been finalized. Google's latest Android operating system is ready to download and use as your daily driver. If you’re one of the many Nexus device owners using a smartphone or tablet released after the Nexus 6, you can install the update once it’s pushed to your device. We’ve already told you about the best features in Android 7 Nougat, like its multi-window options and ability to directly reply from the notification shade. But if you weren’t a part of the beta, you might be stuck on where to start once the new operating system is installed on your device. Here’s a list of the first six things to set up on your new Android Nougat device.   Learn to use Multi-Window Multi-window mode will quickly become your favorite feature on Android Nougat.  Two apps on one screen? It’s possible with Nougat, and once you get a feel for how to use Android’s new multi-window feature you might actually get addicted to using two apps side-by-side. From the Recent apps screen, press and hold the first app you want to run in multi-window mode. Once you see a prompt, drag that app to either side of the screen. You’ll then be able to open another app from Recent apps screen in the secondary window, or you can simply tap on an app from the Home screen visible within that space. When you’re ready to exit this mode, long-press the recent apps list to restore the primary app to full screen. Alternatively, you can slide the edge of the app you’d rather use to either side of the display to make it full screen, or just press the Home button.  Note that not all apps will work with multi-window mode, so be prepared to experiment a bit in the beginning.  Set up Data Saver Saving on cellular data is key in these precarious times when overage charges and data throttling are common. Nougat offers a new feature called Data Saver, which restricts data access to all apps the minute you turn it on. The Data Saver option is available in the Data usage section of the Settings panel.  Data Saver is readily available as an option in the Quick Settings menu, though you can also enable it by navigating to the Data usage category in the Settings panel. From there, you can customize which apps are white-listed—and thus allowed to rampantly use cellular data in the background.  You can choose to whitelist apps you don’t mind using data rampantly in the background.  Apps are completely restricted from sending or receiving data in the background when Data Saver mode is enabled. They only access data when you’re actively using them, and even then you won’t have access to everything. For instance, in apps like Instagram, photos will load only once you land on them. Curate the Quick Settings menu These are the “peek-a-boo” Quick Settings available with the first swipe down of the notifications shade. Marshmallow brought with it a revamped Quick Settings panel, though you couldn’t edit which options appeared up top. In Nougat, you can now curate which settings options appear in the notification shade. Easily edit which apps to include in the Quick Settings panel.  It’s exceptionally easy to set up: Swipe down twice to expand the notifications shade and then tap the Edit button underneath the Quick settings. From here, long-press on a setting to drag it where you’d like. Note that the first five options will be visible with the first drag of the notifications shade, and that the rest of the options appear after the second swipe down. Nougat also allows you to add on an additional page of Quick settings if you need it. Customize the camera’s volume button The volume button can now be used as a shutter button in Nougat’s default Camera app.  This is a minor addition to Nougat, but it’ll make snapping photos easier for everyone involved. In the camera app, tap on the options button and then select Settings. From there, tap on Volume Key Action, and then choose what you’d like the volume key to do: shoot a photo, zoom in, or turn up the volume. Set up a keyboard theme If you’re like me and uninterested in running a third-party keyboard app, you might appreciate that Google finally added in the ability to customize the keyboard theme. If a pink keyboard is your thing, you can have one in Nougat.  In the Settings panel, tap Languages & input and then tap Virtual keyboard. From here, tap the Google Keyboard option, and then tap Theme. You can add your own image as a keyboard theme if you like.  From here, you can select from 16 different keyboard themes, including the ability to add a locally-stored image as a background. Once you’ve made your selection, you can also choose whether or not to display a border over each key. Play with Nougat’s Easter Egg Who needs Neko Atsume when it’s built into Android Nougat? Google has a tradition of hiding an Easter Egg in every new version of Android. In Nougat, you can unlock a cat collecting game that pays homage to apps like Neko Atsume. You’ll know you’ve activated the easter egg once you see this cat emoji pop up.  To activate the Easter Egg, head into the Settings panel and scroll down to About phone. Tap on the Android version number three times, and then tap on the large N logo a few times before long-pressing. If you see the little cat emoji appear below, that means you’ve activated the game. You can leave food to attract cats from the notifications panel. To play the game, you’ll have to add the option to your Quick settings. Using the instructions from earlier on in this article, select the cat icon so that it’s available in your notifications shade. Attract the cats with someone to eat!  Once it’s in there, tap on it from inside the Quick Settings to add food to the dish and attract kitties. You’ll receive a notification when you’ve successfully attracted a new feline. You can then tap on that notification to name your new kitty or share a picture of her with your friends on social media.

Google’s Internet of Things (IoT) Research Award focuses on devices that use the internet to communicate. The grant provided equipment to the GIS Center to use in the development of its design. The project uses Bluetooth-enabled devices, which constantly emit a signal to broadcast the location of volunteer firefighters to unit commanders. The project focuses on rural volunteer fire departments which may not otherwise know where someone is or who is present at the scene of a blaze. Mike Wilson, the director of the GIS Center, is working alongside APSU students to make communication and organization easier for the fire department commanders and volunteers. In an APSU press release, Wilson explained the technology involved. “We got to thinking we could take these beacons and maybe put them in a firefighter’s coat,” Wilson said. “Some beacons have a range of up to 200 meters and they all have a unique ID to them, so if I had this in every firefighter’s coat and I knew what each unique ID was and I had a detector, I could know exactly who is on site at that time.” The technology APSU students developed can be installed and run on laptops and Android mobile devices, and will display real-time information about available responders. “Students were very involved with the design,” Wilson said. “For our projects, we typically assign students to a project with broad goals. The students must figure out how to execute.” The design has not yet been tested in the field.

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo News: Everything You Need to Know About Nougat's Awesome Multitasking Features Dallas Thomas 3 weeks ago Everything You Need to Know About Nougat's Awesome Multitasking Features When Google issues an Android update, the changes are usually all over the place—fixing issues, adding functionality, playing catch-up with the latest thing Apple added to iOS. It's how the smartphone wars have evolved, where the two competing operating systems continually match and one-up each other. But Android 7.0 Nougat is proving to be an exception to this rule, as it actually has a central theme: multitasking. New features like a split-screen view, drag-and-drop functionality, and several nifty shortcuts make this a well-rounded release, and they all work together with the hopes of finally turning Android into a true multitasking platform. Don't Miss: 25 Cool New Things You Can Do with Android Nougat Split-Screen Mode The central aspect to the new multitasking features is a split-screen mode that lets you view two apps side by side. This is a feature that Samsung and LG have added to their manufacturer skins in the past, but it's now officially a part of the main Android code base. Don't Miss: Unlock the Hidden Multi-Window Mode in Android 6.0 Marshmallow Google has been working on split-screen mode for a few versions now, but they wanted to make sure everything was as intuitive as possible before fully releasing the feature. They've definitely succeeded in this goal, because Nougat's split-screen interface is as straightforward as it gets. While you're using any app, simply long-press your recent apps button, then the foreground app will shrink down to only occupy the top half of your screen. In the void this creates, you'll see the rest of your recent apps list—just pick one, and it will occupy the other half of your screen. You can use the two apps simultaneously—scrolling through one, then tapping a link on the other, for instance. While you're doing so, you'll notice a black bar separating the two screens—just drag this in either direction, and the apps will automatically be resized to fit. Then, to exit split-screen mode, just long-press the recent apps button again. Alternatively, you can drag the divider between the two screens all the way to the top or bottom to make one of the apps take up the full screen again. This "resizable windows" feature was made possible by the fact that Android apps always come bundled with different DPI layouts to match the varying screen sizes offered by each device. This basically means that there are small, medium, and large layouts cooked into each app on your phone, which was a lot of extra work for app creators, but coincidentally provides an easy way for Android to resize split-screen content on the fly. So what was once viewed as a burden for Android developers has now become one of the operating system's biggest strengths. Drag & Drop Split-screen mode certainly isn't the only multitasking improvement in Android Nougat. In fact, a recent update to the Gmail app demonstrates that "drag and drop" functionality is possible with any app on Android 7.0. Picture this: Instead of tapping the "Attach" button to add a file to your email, then digging through the various menus to find the PDF you want to add to your message, just open your favorite file browser in split-screen mode, then drag the file directly onto the Gmail app next to it. Developers would have to update their apps for you to get this functionality, but Android Nougat has already made it possible. Faster App Switching Multitasking isn't just about using two apps side by side, as there are many times that you only need to take a quick peek at the last app you were using. With Android Nougat, this has become a lot easier—simply tap your recent apps button twice, then you'll instantly switch to the last app you were using. This works a lot like the Alt-Tab gesture in Windows (and Command-Tab on Macs), so you can keep tapping that button twice to flip back and forth between your two most recently-used apps. Don't Miss: Get Fast App Switching on Android Marshmallow & Lower Quick Reply Notifications Keeping with the theme of getting things done faster with minimal interruptions, Google added a new "Direct Reply" feature to Nougat. When you get a new message, don't stop what you're doing—just tap the "Reply" button on the notification, then type out a response without leaving the app you're currently using. A few apps have had this functionality in the past, but Nougat provides a system-wide API for Direct Reply, which means that any app developer can implement this feature with minimal effort, and the interface will be consistent across all apps that use it. Don't Miss: Android Nougat's Direct Reply Feature Already Looks Dated Next to This App But the multitasking experience certainly isn't the only thing that has been improved in Android 7.0 Nougat.

Views count: 281 Tags: android nougat google Lequte Scientist Curators The latest version of Google's Android Operating System, Android 7.0 codenamed Nougat has been released. According to Google, Android Nougat will allow two apps to be run on the same screen at once, and it will also handle more complex 3D graphics. At the moment, only Nexus-branded handsets and tablets can get the update. Google says a forthcoming phone from LG will also have the software pre-installed. But other device owners will have to wait for manufacturers to carry out their own checks before they make it possible to install the code.   Attached Files: nougat.PNG File size: 106.9 KB Views: 0 Lequte, Aug 22, 2016 #1 You may like Comments [You must log in or sign up to reply here.] Show Ignored Content Log in with Facebook Your name or email address: Do you already have an account?

Google is already at work on Nougat’s first maintenance release scheduled for this fall. Like with Android N, it will first be available as a developer preview before a wider release. Unlike the monthly security-only patches, maintenance releases will likely include new features in addition to “refinements and polish.” The post implies a quarterly schedule for these updates, but it’s unknown whether each release will be accompanied with a version number change. Google will likely maintain the Android Beta Program announced back in March to provide a user-friendly way to download and install the developer previews. Developers will likely still be able to manually install and flash the update. In the past, minor Android .x updates have been released rather inconsistently. This new schedule should provide greater transparency into when updates can be expected. Additionally, by giving OEMs more time to work on updates with developer previews, the majority of Android users might get faster updates. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

An anonymous reader writes: Google today started rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to existing Nexus devices via an over-the-air software update. This is a gradual rollout: The Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C, and General Mobile 4G (Android One) will all be updated, but " it may take several weeks" before everyone gets the latest and greatest, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat.The Nexus 5 (2013), which packs in a Snapdragon 800 SoC coupled with 2GB of RAM and 5-inch full-HD display, won't be receiving Android Nougat update -- despite having all the hardware capabilities required for a phone to receive Google's latest OS update. The truth of the matter is if Google wanted to update the Nexus 5 with the latest Android software, it could have. It just chose not to. It's very likely that same will be the case for the Nexus 6, a phone that has 3GB of RAM, and Snapdragon 805 SoC, next year when the company releases Android O update. android google mobile ← Related Links → Samsung Reminds Us That You Can't Make People Use an App They Don't Want Submission: Google starts rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to Nexus devices Hey Google, Want To Fix Android Updates?

It also marks the point where Google has finally pulled it's head out of the sand and realized that it cannot rely 3rd party manufacturers to properly support their devices, and is taking back control of things like updates, and whatnot. I can only hope that all this means the desperately needed end of the "Landfill Android" era.

Its damn suspicious that the 4 and 5 are limited to Android 5.1 and 6.0 and only the 5X gets 7.0. The 2012 and 2013 Nexus 7 story made sense, the former had only 1GB RAM, the later 2 GB, so only the later got Android 6.0. Screen sizes are the same on the Nexus 5 and 5X. While the 5X has slightly better CPU and GPU the chips in the 5 are still vastly overpowered for what millions of Android users do. Is Android 7.0 64-bit only or something? Even so it seems an arbitrary change. I would understand a desire for such a minimum as a software developer but I would concede it improper to make such a change unless something else is going on, for example 2GB RAM no longer supported.

Announced during Google I/O, along with a messaging service called Allo, Duo is Google’s newest video calling app. Its goal is to make video calling easier, simpler, and more fail proof than the competition. While watching Allo and Duo's demos during I/O, I found myself intrigued. Some of the features looked great. Allo in particular looked fun, but a couple of things made me think that both of these services would ultimately fall flat on its face. Why are Allo and Duo two separate services? If they’re trying to compete with Apple’s iMessage/FaceTime combo, it’s already inferior due to the fact that they appear to be two separate apps that don’t connect or communicate with each other on any level. Another issue is that you currently have to seek out Duo on your own to download from the Play Store, as well as convince others to use the service with you. The same will go for Allo when it is released. Finally, both require phone numbers, with the option of connecting your Google accounts. Initially I was put off by this because not everybody has a phone number, but apparently you can use a Google Voice number to make things work if you’re on a device that uses Wi-Fi only. Given Google’s track record with keeping their services supported and afloat (just look at the current state of Hangouts, or better yet, visit Slate's Google Graveyard and leave a virtual flower), I can’t say I’m convinced that Allo and Duo will end up being any different. For me, this risk plays into my desire to recruit people to this service. I already did this same thing before with Hangouts, but now I’m supposed to get everybody to move to a different Google product? Not exactly convenient, in my opinion. However, I decided to try Duo out anyway. And I have to admit that it’s actually more useful than I thought it would be, so all might not be doom and gloom for at least one of Google’s newest services. The first thing you’ll notice is that Duo is extremely easy to set up, which is in part due to the fact that it uses your phone number rather than usernames or passwords. All I had to do was press one button, and a few seconds later everything was set up and ready to go. I received a text message with a code, which the app automatically registered, and I was done. I don’t think I’ve ever had an easier set-up of something in my life. (It would appear that Google Voice numbers have it a little harder, but it’s still fairly simple.) After you’re all set up, you’re greeted with… your own face with the front-facing camera. There’s also a large button labelled “Video Call”, which takes you to your contact list. Most of my contacts all have an “Invite” button next to their name, but for those who already have it installed you can just tap on their name and get the ball rolling. If you haven’t visited your settings prior to making your first call on Duo, you may be surprised to find that Duo prompts you to smile because a feature called “Knock Knock” is on. Knock Knock allows the person receiving the call to see you before they answer. Initially, I was really weirded out by this concept. I have found that this is one opinion that I’m sticking to. I just don’t like Knock Knock. Fortunately, it can be disabled. However, disabling Knock Knock means all forms of Knock Knock are disabled – nobody can see you, and you can’t see anybody else before answering the call, even if they have Knock Knock enabled. It’s important to note that Knock Knock won’t work for non-contacts regardless if it’s enabled or not. This is good for a lot of reasons. The video calling itself is nice. It’s a simple interface with hardly settings or frills to mess with aside from toggling which camera to use or turning off your mic. It’s about as straightforward as you can get, which might get you to thinking: why bother using Duo over anything else? The answer: solid connectivity. Duo switches seamlessly between data or Wi-Fi, depending on which is your strongest signal, throughout the call. This means that, unless you’re without both data and Wi-Fi, you can expect to stay on the call the whole time. Quality may drop (including losing video function, but keeping audio) or increase, but the call has a solid chance of at least staying connected the entire time. That’s more than I can say for Skype, which is really the only other video messaging service I ever use. I had major disconnect issues on calls with my mom when she was visiting Europe earlier this summer. And that’s really about it. To hang up, you press the big red button at the bottom of your screen, and you’re done. I really like Duo’s simplistic approach to video calling. I think my only gripe about Duo is that there is no manual toggle for audio only. Obviously I could just use my phone app on my phone for that, but it would be handy to have that in Duo so that you could toggle video on or off if needed during a conversation. In the end, I was wrong that Duo would be dead in the water. Its simplicity and ability to keep a call connected through the worst of connections make it a solid option for people who enjoy video calls. I personally don’t use video calling enough to justify recruiting a lot of people to it, but my mom (who I recruited to demo the app with me) is in love with it and is already persuading her friends to download it, so there’s that. Now we wait for Allo. Readers, have you had a chance to try Duo out yet? If so, what are your thoughts on it so far?

Vote for which you think is the best business idea. VIDEOS: Tech entrepreneurs go for Slingshot $50,000 MY WEBSITE RULES: Representatives of the first eight finalist companies to gain funding from Slingshot for their innovative high-tech business ideas. Picture: Dean Osland Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit SCROLL DOWN TO SEE EACH COMPANY'S VIDEO GEEKS, computer nerds, call them what you like, but you might just be looking at the next tech-boom billionaire. Closing the distance between  Hunter Valley and Silicon Valley, these young entrepreneurs   want to reinvent the way we shop,  work, and even  live. The eight  companies form the first intake of an innovative  program aimed at accelerating their ideas and businesses, and thrusting them onto a global stage. They were selected from 150 applicants when the call went out from the Newcastle offices of Slingshot  to find start-up businesses with grand ideas but not a lot of money or connections. Among them is a former FA-18 fighter pilot, a pair of surfing Newcastle brothers who walked away from lucrative jobs to combine work and play, and a 17-year-old whiz kid from Sydney who is redefining online shopping. Dubbed ‘‘The X Factor For Geeks’’, Slingshot’s business accelerator program was launched in March by federal Innovation and Industry Minister Greg Combet. Each is vying for up to $50,000 in seed funding, and are now headlong into a 12-week  program that includes the search for venture capital. The program is backed with $10million of seed funding from global financier Artesian Capital Management. Running Slingshot are Trent Bagnall and Craig Lambert. Bagnall is the former head of software company QMASTOR while Lambert is the former sales director of Yahoo, the former marketing executive of Hunter Sports Group and now advertising manager at Newcastle Newspapers. In the fast-moving digital world, ideas are never thin on the ground, and only a few will become the next eBay, Amazon or Google. Most of Slingshot’s first intake not only have big ideas, but big eyes on international markets, and together they have the potential to create thousands of new jobs. A ‘‘demo day’’ in Newcastle in August will  showcase the companies and their ideas. Slingshot’s premium partners include The Newcastle Herald, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Sparke Helmore, University of Newcastle, Newcastle Innovation and Hunter TAFE, and is backed by organisations including the Hunter Business Chamber, NSW Trade and Investment, Ausindustry, Renew Newcastle, DiGiT and Newcastle Now. CLICK ON THE NAME OF EACH COMPANY TO SEE THEIR VIDEO After you've read about each idea and watched the video, cast your vote. Which Slingshot entry do you think is the best business idea? You'll find a poll at the bottom of this page.  Newsmaven Shaon Diwakar and Herbert Yeung   NEWSMAVEN is essentially a recommendation search engine that will take readers of an online article to similar or related articles that might also be of interest to them. For example, if someone is reading an article about Hunter Valley wines on a news website, Newsmaven will automatically list other stories about, or related to, Hunter Valley wines at the bottom of the article. The search engine might also recommend other stories on other websites, within boundaries set by the owner of the website where the original story was viewed. Likewise, if a reader regularly reads columns or articles on a particular subject, or by a particular author, Newsmaven will list other articles, books or stories written by that author, essentially building a profile of the user and their reading habits.  It’s in a niche market that not only tailors articles and information for a reader, but works for the host website by keeping readers online for longer periods and thereby opening up new and better advertising markets for them. It’s the brainchild of Shaon Diwakar and Herbert Yeung, formerly of Sydney, but who have moved to Newcastle to take part in the Slingshot project and develop their idea. Shaon and Herbert have been working full-time on their project since September. They first met at university where they studied software engineering. They are already talking to prospective clients. World BX (Formerly FlightBids) Jason Fitch, Nick Trkulja and Alvin Tolentino THE cost of air travel has never been so cheap, but it could be about to get a whole lot cheaper for some. FlightBids is a unique airfare auction site. Behind it are Sydney-based trio Jason Fitch, Nick Trkulja and Alvin Tolentino.  The site will offer domestic and international flights for 1 cent each. Each flight will be advertised for about 24 hours, during which time any registered bidder can join in with pre-purchased $1 bids. For example, the site might offer two return flights to Bali for 1¢. A bidder makes a bid, costing them $1 and pushing the price of the flights up to 2¢. Another bidder shells out a $1 bid, pushing the price up to 3¢, and so on. Each bid extends the auction time, and that  continues until only one bidder remains and the time elapses. Those who miss out lose their $1 bids, but the winning bidder, according to the site’s backers, will likely secure the flight for only a couple of dollars.   Fewzion Paul Moynagh and Alex Retzlaff FEWZION is a shift and productivity tool that is already saving several mining companies bucketloads of money and giving them the potential to save millions. The software, being developed and fine-tuned by Alex Retzlaff and Paul Moynagh, replaces the old spreadsheets and whiteboards still widely used in the mining industry with an online tool that manages work and productivity, identifies problems and conditions, and keeps pace with targets. In a coalmine, for example, a long-term plan is always in play, setting out which part of a pit will be mined next. With real-time data  being entered into the software, a manager can take better control of what’s going on underground, identifying where resources are needed to meet targets and avoid potential problems. The system is already being used by two large, international mining companies in Queensland, and the pair  are in talks with several Hunter Valley miners. At one of the Queensland sites, productivity has more than doubled since a new management team started and adopted the Fewzion system. Retzlaff, now based in Newcastle, and Moynaugh, based in Queensland, have spent two years developing Fewzion. They are also in the process of adapting it to other industries and are  in talks with several large players in the construction, gas and oil industries.   Choosly  Rory Houston and Lucas Taulealeausumai  EVER wondered what knives the best chefs use? What about the boots that the world’s best footy players wear? Choosly is an online catalogue aimed at helping shoppers select products that are not so much endorsed by the professionals, but actually used by them. Someone in the market for a new camera, for example, can use Choosly to see what cameras and associated gear the professionals use.  Rory Houston and Lucas Taulealeausumai are the brains behind Choosly. The pair worked together in the Air Force before venturing out with their bold tech ideas. Houston is based in Newcastle while Taulealeausumai is based in Melbourne. The idea is not about celebrities or sporting professionals endorsing various products, but all about what products they use. Houston said that no one really wants to know what watches and fragrances are being endorsed by celebrities, but they do want to know what tools of the trade will give them a professional edge. It might be the strapping tape used by physiotherapists, the cricket bat used by a great batsman or the cookware used by the great chefs. Choosly has a website already up and running but the project is still in the testing stages. Houston and Taulealeausumai are working with retailers and manufacturers, showing them how the unbiased data can boost user engagement and, of course, sales.  Chinese Whispers Music  Tim Hodgkinson, Mike Kirkwood-Smith and Daniel Farrugia TWELVE years ago, Tim Hodgkinson was sitting at home writing a song. When writer’s block struck, he sought help from fellow musicians online, who added some creative input.  Back then, music was exchanged via CDs in the mail, but with advances in digital technology, sharing and collaborating on musical projects has become much easier. Chinese Whispers Music was finally born two years ago after spending a long time on the backburner. Hodgkinson has since recruited a former college lecturer to the fold, along with a former bandmate who specialises in marketing and digital design. Essentially, Chinese Whispers will create a global musical community that will bring musicians together to collaborate on projects creatively and without borders. ‘‘We’re in the game of enabling people and unlocking potential,’’ Hodgkinson said.  ‘‘When I started it was just about engaging with people, which is what music is really all about.’’ The site will be a free service model, with a premium service and advertising expected to pay the bills.  Its founders hope that some collaborations will generate sellable music, and perhaps even generate a No.1 hit. ‘‘It would be nice to think that the site could bring together a musician in New York, London and Newcastle to create a fantastic song,’’ Hodgkinson said.  ‘‘And it’s good that it would all be tied back to Newcastle, which has such a great heritage of great music and musicians.’’ The site is in test stages and being used by a closed group, but it currently allows interested people to register their interest before it goes to market fully.  The 360 Mall  Alex Danieli and Jon Valentino    THE 360 Mall is an online virtual shopping centre, but is unlike any that shoppers may already have seen. Alex Danieli and Jon Valentino wanted to close the gap between bricks and mortar stores and online stores by merging the best of both.  Essentially, their online shopping mall recreates the flagship stores of major retailers online – the shelves, the product placements, the racks and even the checkouts. It allows browsers to enter the store, wander around, select products and buy. Store layout is a major part of a retailer’s branding, so the 360 mall is designed to replicate the feel, look and experience of those stores so that they’re recognisable to online shoppers. From a retailer’s point of view, the mall allows them to cut through the noise and distractions of traditional shopping centres and cater to a focused market and shopper. Danieli and Valentino are both from Sydney and have been working on the mall project for two years. Danieli is still in year 11 at St Andrew’s school in Sydney’s CBD. The pair launched a test project last year that attracted more than 100 retailers and more than 50,000 online shoppers over a three-month period. They agreed to pull the site down and develop it further so that it could cater for an international market.  BuyItRideIt  Ben Barter and Josh Barter  BEN and Josh Barter were working in the banking and building industries when they decided to combine their business and technical expertise with their other great passion, for action sports. The Newcastle-based brothers came up with BuyItRideIt, a one-stop online shop for action sports enthusiasts.  The site offers a value-added strategy for buyers in that it becomes a place to compare products, in terms of quality and price, and get questions answered from a number of retailers without the need to drive around all the stores. It will also act as a forum for action sports enthusiasts looking for information, interviews, reviews and advice from the professionals. It also provides a platform for retailers to connect their bricks and mortar stores, their products and websites to an engaged audience of potential and like-minded customers. It has already been well received by a network of 87 retailers. The site primarily targets surfing, cycling, motorcycling, waterboarding, skiboarding, kiteboarding and jetski enthusiasts. The BuyItRideIt website was first launched in December after a year in development, but a new website was launched this week with further development in the wind. The site is primarily designed for a national market, but the Newcastle brothers have eyes on an international model that will bring together retailers and thrillseekers from around the globe.  MemberPass  Grant Levy and Weng Fai Wong   GRANT Levy knows what it’s like being a small business operator competing against the big players, so he set about finding a competitive advantage. When he met Weng Fai Wong through a mutual friend, the pair began a collaboration aimed at simplifying membership payments for small operators in the health, fitness and wellbeing sectors. What they ended up with was MemberPass, a scheme they hope will build loyalty for small operators and simplify membership payments for members. Grant is also a personal trainer and wanted a system where his clients could pay for their fitness sessions automatically through a simple web-based payment system. Such a system enables him to sell his clients longer and broader memberships, building loyalty and turning casual clients into regulars or recurring clients. The system could be used by others operating in similar sectors – yoga instructors, martial arts studios –  and by those in broader markets such as health and beauty professionals, and even chiropractors and acupuncturists. The site will also act as a forum for members to leave reviews, talk to and meet friends, and recommend classes or health professionals. It will house a suite of other sites under the banner of fitnessoz.com that will map and group operators, thereby giving them an online presence that is mostly beyond the reach of smaller, independent operators. The site is still in private test stages but the first version will likely be operating in several months.

By Brooke Crothers Published August 22, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print HP Chromebook 13 G1  (Hewlett-Packard) Hewlett-Packard’s Chromebook 13 is the best evidence yet that the Chromebook is here to stay. Built around Google’s Chrome operating system (OS), Chromebooks are inexpensive laptops that are beginning to challenge the hegemony of Windows and the Mac. In brief: the Chromebook, for many, can be your only laptop. I can say that with authority because I’m very attached to Windows and Mac machines. Despite that, I have been happily using HP’s Chromebook 13 exclusively for a couple of weeks. Chromebooks are powerful if you give them time Jumping to another operating environment is always jarring. There’s no way to avoid the initial gotchas, pitfalls, and frustration. Chrome OS is no different. The flip side is, it can also open your eyes to a better way of doing things. And Chrome OS could be a better way for lots of consumers looking for an inexpensive platform that is essentially self-repairing, secure, extremely fast, and where all future operating systems are ultimately headed. Chrome OS is based on Google’s popular Chrome browser. So, if you’ve spent time in the Chrome browser, you’ll have a pretty good idea of what to expect. Chrome OS is presented as a “desktop” -- just like Windows or Mac -- with icons and a settings bar (the latter analogous to the Control Panel in Windows or System Preferences in OS X). But everything takes place in the browser. That gives you access to Google’s excellent office suite, its Pixlr image editor, Google Photos, the Chrome Web Store, Play Music, Play Movies, Google Hangouts, and lots more. The HP Chromebook 13 G1 The Chromebook 13 G1 is HP’s 2016 high-end Chromebook, starting at $499. Believe or not, that’s pricey for a Chromebook, which often sell in the $199 to $399 range. For $499 you get a lot, though. For starters, HP includes a 13.3-inch 3,200-by-1800 “QHD+” display. When HP announced the Chromebook 13 G1, I had to do a double-take on the display specs. In short, you won't find a 2016 Windows PC or Mac with that kind of display for anything close to $499. Other specs for the $499 model include an Intel Pentium 4405Y (1.5GHz) processor, 4GB RAM, and 32GB of storage. While the processor, RAM, and storage specs may seem meager, they’re not. That’s the beauty of a Chromebook— you don’t need a fast processor or a large hard drive. The new 2016 Chromebooks with Intel’s lower-end 6th Generation Pentium or Core M processors are fast. And because the storage takes place in the cloud, 32GB is adequate. Other notable HP Chromebook 13 specs include a 2.84 pound weight (but it feels lighter because of the good weight distribution), a 0.5-inch thickness (laptops don’t get much thinner than that), and a sturdy aluminum chassis. Related: Is the iPad Pro the future of laptops? Apple thinks so Discounts abound as Apple's laptops show their age The best laptops to buy this summer The HP Chromebook 13 I’m using goes for just over $800. That extra cost is mostly pegged to the faster Intel 6th Generation M5 processor and 8GB of RAM in my model (instead of 4GB). Battery life is good. I found the 3-cell, 45Wh battery delivered a long time between charges. What most reviews (which found battery life lacking) miss is that a laptop with a very-high-resolution display, like HP’s Chromebook 13, is never going to last long between charges without a really big battery. But I got more than seven hours doing lots of productivity work, watching a short movie, and the usual social media and Web browsing. All in all, the HP Chromebook 13 is a high-quality laptop that delivers a lot of bang for the buck and presages a bright future the Chrome OS. Caveats The following caveats don’t apply to HP’s Chromebook specifically, but to any Chromebook. If you’re wedded to Windows and Microsoft Office, the Chromebook probably won’t be a satisfying experience. I’m a heavy Office 365 and OneDrive (Microsoft’s online file hosting service) user. While the Chrome OS gives you access to the online version of Microsoft Office, many of the full Office features are missing. That said, I found that the Google office suite is a powerful replacement and I would be perfectly happy using it full time (as I’ve been doing). Another thing to keep in mind is, you don’t have access to the range of apps available to Windows and Mac users. In my experience with the Chromebook, however, I always found ways to get things done and almost always found a comparable app online. Chrome OS Offline: Whether I’m using Windows, Mac, or Chrome OS, I’m always online (as are most people these days). That said, Chromebooks are designed as cloud devices that rely on being connected to the Web. But Chromebooks are much better at working offline now. For example, when I was writing this review in Google Docs, I turned off the Wi-Fi, and Chrome immediately notified me that all changes were being saved offline.   Finally, the question that always gets asked is, why do I need a Chromebook if I can just run the Chrome browser on my Windows PC or Mac? My response: true, but why not consider a cheap Chromebook that’s fast, secure, manages and updates itself automatically, and has almost none of the clutter and overhead that Windows and macOS have. Besides, the kind of OS that Google is offering is the future of the PC and Mac. Look no further than Apple’s iOS.   Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Apple just patented an iPhone that clips to your clothes 2 Twitter fail: CEO Jack Dorsey accidentally suspended from platform 3 Facebook has reportedly developed News Feed software to suppress posts in China 4 President-elect Trump still wants Apple to make iPhones in America 5 Apple Computer Sales: Black Friday Deals on iPads and MacBooks See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

It's the ability to sign in to Chrome OS using a PIN code. Previously if someone wanted to lock down their Chromebook, they'd need to use their Google account password or pair it with a smartphone. The third option was revealed by Google developer and self-proclaimed "Happy Evangelist" François Beaufort, who stated on his Google+ page that this is an experimental feature that's currently being tested in the latest Dev update. "All you have to do is enable the flag chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin, restart Chrome, and go to Chrome Material Design settings page for now to set up your Lock Screen PIN in the new 'Screen Lock' section," Beaufort explains. "When it's done, lock your screen with 🔍+ L and enjoy the new unlock experience!" He added that the "Quick unlock" settings will also land in the regular Chrome settings page soon, but didn't offer up a specific time frame. The initial reaction to the feature upgrade is positive so far. And as one user noted in the comments section, this is a great upgrade from a security standpoint. "It's not so much the convenience of a PIN login, but to not be forced to type in the 'key to the empire' every time you log into just a Chromebook," Michael Gebetsroither noted. Another commenter, Richard Tan, agreed with that assessment, but also thinks that "this PIN unlock feature should be expanded to also include passwords, so the password is not linked to the Google account but a saparate password just for the device."

Google's End of Life policy for its devices means that support for the oldest of Chromebooks could soon draw to a close. Google guarantees support for "5 years for Chrome devices from launch of the hardware," after which it "cannot indefinitely ensure [...] that older Chrome devices will receive updates to leverage new OS features." That includes security updates. The appeal of a Chromebook lies in the fact that, as essentially all the heavy lifting is done by the Chrome browser, internal hardware abilities over time should be less of a concern than with a traditional laptop. However, even a browser and browser-based apps can start to become more resource-heavy over five years, so Google's support timeframe is understandable. At present, the Samsung Series 5 and CR-48 prototype have passed their End of Life dates, while Acer's AC700 is set to expire this month. However, as PC World points out, Google allows for some flexibility here, with both the Samsung Series 5 and CR-48 still receiving some updates to the present day. Google seems prepared to extend support particularly when it comes to security patches – sensible given that rival Microsoft rolls out security updates for up to 10 years for its legacy operating systems. In the meantime, users of older Chromebooks should brace themselves for a notification announcing that End of Life allowance has been reached. While it's not the final death knell for a Chromebook, which should continue to work (with diminishing app support) for some time afterwards, consider it a prompt to start filling the piggy bank once again.

The update brings a whole slew of new features to the Android platform, and Nexus owners will be the first to get their hands on the update. Google has started rolling out the Over-The-Air update to the following devices: Nexus 6 Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel C General Mobile 4G (Android One) This marks the end of the line for the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 (2013), but that’s no surprise as all things must come to an end at some point. We are still waiting for Google to release the factory images so that you can easily flash the Nougat good-ness onto your devices. Although Google flipped the switch on the update today, it will probably be a slow-staged rollout so it may be a few weeks before the final version arrives on your device. Additionally, for those who were part of the Android N beta program, the next update received will be the final version of Android Nougat. Drop us a line below and let us know what your favorite features of Android Nougat are.

X Google’s new Android system Nougat: better, faster, slimmer Operating system to be released soon offers improved multitasking, smarter notifications Mon, Aug 22, 2016, 18:51 Samuel Gibbs Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat is a great update. It makes some significant changes under the hood that provide benefits including longer battery life. Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images         Android 7.0 Nougat is the new version of Google’s mobile operating system, used by billions of devices around the world. It features longer battery life, improved multitasking and smarter notifications in a slimmed down and refined Android experience – following on the work done in last year’s version 6 Marshmallow. It is faster, more polished and a subtly-better experience all-round. Apps install more quickly, the OS can be smaller in size and updates to Android can be installed on the fly, without having to wait for 10 minutes while it reboots, if you have a new device. Gaming upgrade The new Vulcan API graphics system is also baked in for better gaming performance and Nougat will support Google’s Daydream virtual reality system, eventually. Nougat is not, however, a major visual overhaul of Android. Those that have used Marshmallow on any of Google’s Nexus smartphones or devices with little in the way of modification to Android, such as the OnePlus 3, will instantly recognise it. This review was conducted using a pre-release version of Nougat running on various Google Nexus and Pixel devices, as such some small things may vary on the production version of Nougat released on Monday. Better notifications Most of the work has gone on behind the scenes but the one obvious change in Nougat is to notifications. They’re now flatter and wider, filling the entire width of the screen on a smartphone, and joined directly to each other, which wastes less space than Marshmallow’s card-like appearance. Multiple notifications from the same app also cluster together, which cleans up the notification shade and makes it easier to see what’s what at a glance and dismiss en masse. The biggest functional change for notifications, however, is the wider roll out of quick reply functions. Google’s apps such as Messenger and Hangouts have had quick reply features for a while but now basically every communications app should have the feature. ADVERTISEMENT Users can hit reply from the notification and type their message directly into the box under the notification, which will also show a small snippet of the history of the conversation if you haven’t opened the app since the last reply. Faster toggles Google has also put a row of icons above notifications for toggling features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, screen rotation and similar, which can be quickly tapped without expanding to the full set of quick toggles. It reduces the number of swipes needed to turn off Wi-Fi, for instance, by one and is a simple, helpful new addition. You can customise what appears there, by modifying what’s in the top of the full quick toggles pane. Dragging down from the top with two fingers still opens up the full quick settings pane in one motion. Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Instagram takes on Snapchat with live, ‘disappearing’ video How to . . . help out your smartphone battery Multi-window Multi-window, or side-by-side split screen support, is the other big new functional addition. There are three ways to activate it. Pressing and holding the so-called overview button with one app on screen invokes the recently used apps list in a split-screen view to select a second app to put on screen. You can also do it from the recently used apps list by taping and holding one of the apps in the list and dragging to the top of the screen or the left or right-hand sides if in landscape, allowing you to pick the other app from the list. A hidden method activated in the System UI Tuner works by swiping up on the screen from the overview button. Once in split-screen mode, Nougat behaves similarly to Windows and iOS. Users can drag the black bar in the middle to change the size of the split, or remove it altogether. Pressing and holding the overview button, which shows as two halves when active, will cancel multi-window too. It works really well, with almost every app supporting it. Only a very small minority of apps actively block it, and those might be updated in the near future to support multi-window. It’s a feature that should have been there for a long time for Android tablets and makes them more productive as work machines. It’s less useful for smartphones, although landscape multi-window on large-screen phablets can be useful in situations where you need to keep an eye on two things simultaneously, such as a map and a conversation. Overview function Double-tapping the overview button will also switch straight to the last-used app, which makes bouncing between two apps a lot faster. Copy text or links between apps is now rapid. Other devices, including the OnePlus 3 have had this feature for a while, but it’s good to see it baked into Android. Battery life One of the best bits about Android 6.0 Marshmallow was the introduction of Doze, a feature that helped save battery when the phone or tablet wasn’t moving, such as being placed on a desk. It made a big difference to standby battery life. Android 7.0 Nougat applies the same battery-extending features to when the phone is moving too. When the screen is off, Nougat has much tighter controls on what can and can’t access data, how frequently and how often it wakes the phone up. The result is between 15 and 20 per cent longer battery life in my testing on a Nexus 6P. Facial recognition Google’s smart lock features have been around for a while. They use a combination of sensors to know when to deactivate the screen lock and when to make sure the passcode is always required. Facial recognition has been available for a while, but the trusted face system has significantly improved since Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is particularly useful for tablets and other devices without a fingerprint scanner. ADVERTISEMENT Using a Pixel C, the system went from slightly useful in the odd occasion when it worked to unlocking the device about 80 per cent of the time. In fact, the onlytimes it didn’t recognise my face were when I was wearing sunglasses and overly large headphones. Verdict Overall Android 7.0 Nougat is a great update. It makes some significant changes under the hood that provide benefits including longer battery life. The visual tweaks are subtle and most will likely be masked by the customisations made to Android by third-party manufacturers. The quick-reply additions to notifications feel like they should have been there from the start. But perhaps the best small tweak that all manufacturers should now adopt is the ability to double-tap the overview button to quickly jump between the last two used apps. It’s so much faster than bouncing to a menu and back, and takes no dexterity at all to activate. One thing is certain, however – if you didn’t like Android Marshmallow, Nougat isn’t going to do anything to change your mind. Google’s Nexus devices, including the Nexus 6, 5X, 6P, 9 and Nexus Player, as well as the Google Pixel C tablet, will receive the update over-the-air starting today. The LG V20 will be the first new smartphone to launch with Nougat due for release soon. – Guardian Service       Topics: Google Read More Three UK hit by data breach but no risk to Irish customers This week we’re talking about . . . fakebook Get smart with the Science Gallery Podcast Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Online reviews: what you read isn’t always what you get Research finds way to curb racist tweets Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Sport Olympic ticket agent Kevin Mallon must lodge €410,000 to get passport back Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 17:35 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 17:23 Builder Siac posts profits of €322,000 15:47 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 15:38 Organisations set to increase IT spend, survey shows 15:18 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Tech Tools: projector for use with smartphones Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Fool your children into activity by turning it into a game Prynt prints your smartphone photos – and adds video Tech Tools: It’s augmented reality meets actual reality with the help of Zink technology Smart wifi plug gives you the power to control the power Tech Tools: TP Link device means you can use home appliances from your smartphone Most Read in Business 1 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 2 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 3 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 4 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 5 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 6 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 7 Michael Noonan says ‘brass-plate operations’ will not be welcome 8 Loosening of mortgage rules will push up house prices, says Davy 9 Sorry millennials: Buying a home was just as hard for your parents 10 Thousands affected as RaboDirect axes investment funds Never miss a story.

How Google Duo Is Shaking Up the Video Conferencing Crowd Google Duo is notable in that the video-calling app is easy to use and works across both iOS and Android. Here's a look at the world's most popular app. Google Is Emphasizing Simplicity Central to the Duo experience is simplicity. Google designed the app so users can access their contacts quickly and, with a single tap, request to hold a video conference with another user. The app's design is stripped down to let users make video calls in just seconds. Cross-Platform Support Is a Biggie Google hopes to differentiate itself from Apple's FaceTime by offering Duo support on both iOS and Android. The feature means Android users can call iOS users and vice versa. So far, Duo doesn't support Windows 10 Mobile. The Service Works Across WiFi and LTE Google Duo supports calling across both WiFi networks and LTE. The company says the service will work on any WiFi or LTE network, so carrier choice will not matter. In addition, the call can switch to and from WiFi easily without ever losing a connection. There's a Neat 'Knock Knock' Feature Google Duo includes a "Knock Knock" feature that alerts users to an incoming call. The recipient then has the ability to look at a preview of the video call before deciding whether to answer. It's an especially useful tool when someone receives a call from a person he or she doesn't know, and isn't sure why they're calling. Google Is Promising High-Quality Video Google says its behind-the-scenes technology is designed specifically to deliver high-quality video across both WiFi and LTE. While many people who currently use Duo say that it achieves that goal, be aware that—like any other video app—quality will depend on connection speeds. What About Google Hangouts? Duo technically competes with Google Hangouts' video-calling feature, but Google said at its I/O Conference earlier this year when it announced Duo that it would not abandon Hangouts. Instead, it expects both apps to live on and provide users options on how they'd like set up video conferences. However, Google Hangouts On Air, the company's live-streaming service, will be discontinued in September. There Are iOS, Android Requirements Not all iOS and Android users will be able to get on Duo. According to its listing in the Google Play marketplace, Duo requires Android 4.1 or later to work. On the Apple side, users can run Duo on an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, but will need to run iOS 9.0 or later. Here Are Its Chief Competitors Duo has several competitors, but arguably its chief opponents are Apple's FaceTime, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Skype also might fall into that pack, although Skype is a bit more sophisticated to serve business users. Google has designed Duo to be simple to use, and that's what Facebook and Apple, especially, are trying to achieve. Duo Has a Thing for Security and Privacy Google noted in a blog post Aug. 15 that the company's Duo application was built "with an emphasis on privacy and security." To that end, Google has said that all video calls between users are "end-to-end encrypted." In other words, there is no way for third parties, including law enforcement and even Google, to see what two users are chatting about on Duo. Duo Is a Free App With No In-App Purchases Google seems committed to making Duo as accessible to as many users as possible. The app description notes the program is free and includes no in-app purchases. Google has so far said that it has no plans to change that strategy in the future.

The app is Google's latest bet on a booming video-calling market packed with competitors including Facebook Messenger, Facebook-owned WhatsApp, Microsoft's Skype and Apple's FaceTime. Google is hoping that its stripped-down Duo can stand above the crowd by working across both iOS and Android: The company argues that this level of simplicity isn't matched by the current field of video calling/conference services. Google Duo also includes a nifty preview feature to let recipients see who is calling. It even works across both WiFi and LTE networks. So far, those features appear to be catching on with users. This slide show discusses the features that are attracting users to Google Duo and why it's succeeding in such a packed market.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google released Android Nougat to Nexus devices on Monday. It’s Google’s latest and greatest mobile operating system, but it’s already being tweaked. In a post detailing today’s launch, Google vice president of engineering Dave Burke said Google is already working on the first Android Nougat update. “In fact, we’ve already started work on the first Nougat maintenance release, that will bring continued refinements and polish, and we’re planning to bring that to you this fall as a developer preview,” Burke explained, noting that Google plans to stick to a “new regular maintenance schedule.” That suggests frequent updates in addition to Google’s monthly security patches. “We’ll be closing open bugs logged against Developer Preview builds soon, but please keep the feedback coming,” Burke said. It’s safe to assume some of those bugs will be patched in the first update. No word on when that’ll hit.

Nougat adds split-screen multitasking, system-wide quick-reply notifications, improved emojis and a variety of other minor visual tweaks, moving the operating system more in line with Google’s Material Design philosophy. Most notably, the update will likely have an impact on users of larger Android phones or a tablet that utilizes Google’s operating system. On the tablet side of the spectrum, iOS has always been significantly ahead of Android in terms of operating system  functionality, particularly when it comes to multitasking. As expected, only those with Nexus devices, including the Nexus 6P, 5X, 6, 9, Nexus Player (which has been discontinued) and Pixel C tablet, will be able to download Nougat at launch. In typical fashion, Nougat will slowly make its way to other devices via manufacturer and carrier channels. It’s unclear what the specific release date will be for each device, but it’s expected Nougat will land on the above platforms in the coming weeks. We’ll be sure to update this post to let you know when Android 7.0 hits Google’s line of various Nexus devices in Canada. Have you been able to download Nougat yet in Canada? Let us know in the comments section. – Update 08/22/16 3:13pm: A number of readers are reporting that Android 7.0 has rolled out to Rogers, Bell and Videotron Nexus 6P owners. Android preview memembers, regardless of carrier, can also instantly get access to Nougat. Related: LG’s new V20 smartphone will be the world’s first Android N device MXM4K Nexus 6P, on Telus / Koodo (bought from Google directly), nothing as of 1:35PM. Claude Gohier The roll out starts today, but as usual it can takes a few weeks before everybody gets it. MXM4K Still nothing, running stock 6.0.1, might have to wait a bit like Claude said. Patrick O’Rourke I’m on Koodo as well, still nothing. Kar Yung Tom On Rogers. Still nothing. Just an FYI. Jean Racine The same for me. nexus 6p MXM4K If you have a Nexus 5X or 6P, sign up for the Android Beta Program, it’ll give you access to 7.0 instantly. Once installed, you can remove yourself from the program and keep 7.0 Iz3man So excited!! My first nexus.. Problem I’m on dirty unicorns.. Should I wipe it clean and flash 7… slimdizzy Wipe and clean flash 6 for the 7 OTA or wait for images to flash 7. DU wont get you anywhere here. Im on DU as well and will flash 7 as soon as i can. Iz3man I needed very little convincing. I’ll do it tonight.. Well maybe tomorrow, my wife won’t like me androiding on our anniversary.. 😐 Samuel Gomez Recuero LOL: The same day #Rogers delivers Android 6.0 to S6 customers! #Fail Adam B Factory and OTA images haven’t been posted online yet, so I doubt they’ve started rolling out OTA to devices. mob70 Got it 15 minutes ago. Adam B Were you running a Developer Preview, or Marshmallow? mob70 Dev. Preview. Give it à try. awhite2600 I’m running the latest 6.0.1 – rooted. The lack of factory images prevents me from updating. I’m tempted to unroot, see if the update is available and then re-root later. I’m rooted mostly to allow for Titanium Backup. Adam B I’m in the same boat. mob70 Try the dev Preview. awhite2600 Unrooted to stock 6.0.1 with the latest security updates on my Nexus 6P. (Build MTC20F) Update not showing for me on Rogers. I’ll wait patiently and then reroot once I’ve updated. Trying to keep it simple if possible. awhite2600 That didn’t take me very long. I broke down and enrolled in the dev preview as mob70 suggested. Downloading now. (I’m so weak. ????) Adam B You can un-enroll from the Beta if you don’t want future beta builds. You won’t lose Nougat if you’ve already installed. Civuck Just manually checked now (2:00pm EDT) on my Nexus 6P (on Rogers) and sure enough, an update was waiting. Downloaded and installing now… Patrick O’Rourke Interesting. Thanks for the heads-up! Adam B It looks like it’s rolling out to those running the developer preview first. Duce Got it on Rogers Hunter Miller Just got the update on my Nexus 6p Clyde96 Got it on bell minutes ago!!! Ernie I just got it on my Nexus 6p. I am with Koodo. It’s only 49 mb if you have the preview 5 running on it. mob70 Just got it on my Videotron Nexus 6P Doctor Blackson Nothing yet on Rogers Winnipeg 1:33pm Carl M I am in Winnipeg on Rogers as well. I got tired of waiting so I enrolled in the beta with the link above. I immediately got access to (now non-beta) Nougat. I will un-enroll from the beta as soon as it is installed. Neal Telus Nexus 6p downloading as of 12:30pm MST. Already on Dev preview 5 so the download is only 49.5 MB. That being said it’s taking forever on a 100Mbit wifi connection. Those Google servers must be busy! Civuck It appears people on Dev Preview 5 might be getting this new 7.0 update first. My colleague also with a 6P but on 6.0.1 Marshmallow (Aug. 5 security patch) is still not getting an update notice when manually checking. Josh Brown Got it Civuck Does anyone else on Dev Preview know? : Since installing today’s update, it no longer notifies you are part of the Developer Preview Program during boot. Does that mean you have been un-enrolled automatically from the program and need to re-enroll for Android O (8.0) beta program whenever it begins? Jonah Emery If you enroll in the Android preview, even right now, you will instantly get the final release of Nougat. Hawken Enrolled and within a second got the update ricazoid Can confirm. Enrolled and update was pushed to my 6p immediately James where do you enroll? awhite2600 android [dot] com [slash] beta I enrolled my 6P and received the download notification within a few seconds. Reports are that you will get the final build. I’m downloading now. TechHungry Thank you @awhite2600:disqus enrolled, downloaded and installed. Lucky for me, internet connection at work is pretty smooth 🙂 Adam B @disqus_7sLzhB41jD:disqus @sherif_ebeid:disqus If you don’t want Beta builds in the future, you can un-enroll from the Beta program (the same way you enrolled) without losing Nougat. Brian Ayotte How do you enroll? Thx. Gurjot Mand 1:21 in calgary running android developer preview on my nexus 6p just got the update 20 minutes ago For my sisters nexus 6 nothing yet. Both are on Rogers Steve Been using the Developer Preview for the last couple months and just got my final update this afternoon Steve Service Provider has nothing to do with getting this update, it comes directly from Google David Michie Got on my 5x from virgin was in the beta program Jonathan King Nothing yet. Nexus 6P on Virgin. Minh Vo you just have to enrol in the android beta program and should receive a notification for android 7.0 Nexus 6p Rogers Omar Also, the Nexus 6P is back in stock (at regular price) on Google Play. So I guess the new lineup won’t be released anytime soon. Gurjot Mand They should be releasing it around the same time frame as last year so end of September New Nexus devices should be out Baruch I’m doing an update on my Google Store Nexus 6P, I’m not sure if it is including 7.

Ricardo Marques I download android 7.0…the device installed and rebooted. When I turn on my NEXUS 6P and i go to “about phone”…says android 6.0.1…WTF? Craig B. Mine did this as well. After I rebooted, I went back into the System update and the Android 7 update would show for a second them flash back to the one saying the system was up to date. It’s now currently “installing” 7 again, so we’ll see what happens. Maybe it installs the security updates first then tries the OS upgrade. I dunno… A. Ricardo Marques I dunno what it installed but I wasn’t going to use my mobile data to download another 1.2gb or whatever it was. When I got home I tried again and finally got android 7 🙂 Craig B. Yep, that’s what mine did too. Now on 7! ryhm i’m on Bell, got the update around 11am pacific time. too bad it didn’t come with the new Nexus Laucher. Michael Nemeth Nexus 6p on Telus got the update around 8pm PT §teve You have to be subscribed to the Android beta program to have the update. I was’nt, but the second I subscribed, I received the update (Nexus 6p on Rogers) Twice Me and my 5 aren’t bitter at all. Not a bit. Monster Munster Anyone know when allo is being released?

Standard Marshmallow… Nothing yet, but checking a few times a day. bryguy76 Still no update. bryguy76 Just got my update. Everything went fine… Took almost two hours after optimizing all the apps. Atactic Enrolled my Nexus 6 on beta program, got NPD90G preview version. toxic_ks Haven’t got it on Bell yet 🙁 Saskatchewan kellymelly Nexus 6, Bell, still waiting 🙁 awhite2600 Thanks for the tip. Sadly, too late for me. I unrooted and then enrolled in the beta and installed Nougat. I have used FlashFire to install monthly security patches without losing root. I wasn’t sure if it would be safe to use FlashFire to make the jump from 6.0.1 to 7.0. (I’ve read recommendations to use OTAs unrooted or to fully flash a major update.) Rerooting should be fairly simple. I typically let the WUGFRESH Toolkit do the hard work. ChrisArchitect Got the update notice this morning, Nexus 5X, Bell Canada Umar vakil Still waiting for an update. I am using Chatr. I dont think the carrier matters as I have purchased it unlocked from the playstore Marcus Engstrom Updating to Nougat this morning. Fido Nexus 5x. Umar vakil Still No update on my nexus 6p. I did try enrolling my device for the dev preview. I got a notification to install the update which I did and once the phone rebooted, it gave me a error saying “No command ” with a an exclamation mark, I dont know the way out of this and ended up unerolling my device 🙁 kunikida2011 On Telus nexus 6p still no Android 7 as of 6 minutes ago kevy On Bell, Still nothing, running stock 6.0.1.

Me Me either on Telus with a Nexus 6 Jlhay I was pretty excited today when I saw there was an update available for my 6P on Koodo. Was just a security update though.

Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images         Android 7.0 Nougat is the new version of Google’s mobile operating system, used by billions of devices around the world. It features longer battery life, improved multitasking and smarter notifications in a slimmed down and refined Android experience – following on the work done in last year’s version 6 Marshmallow. It is faster, more polished and a subtly-better experience all-round. Apps install more quickly, the OS can be smaller in size and updates to Android can be installed on the fly, without having to wait for 10 minutes while it reboots, if you have a new device. Gaming upgrade The new Vulcan API graphics system is also baked in for better gaming performance and Nougat will support Google’s Daydream virtual reality system, eventually. Nougat is not, however, a major visual overhaul of Android. Those that have used Marshmallow on any of Google’s Nexus smartphones or devices with little in the way of modification to Android, such as the OnePlus 3, will instantly recognise it. This review was conducted using a pre-release version of Nougat running on various Google Nexus and Pixel devices, as such some small things may vary on the production version of Nougat released on Monday. Better notifications Most of the work has gone on behind the scenes but the one obvious change in Nougat is to notifications. They’re now flatter and wider, filling the entire width of the screen on a smartphone, and joined directly to each other, which wastes less space than Marshmallow’s card-like appearance. Multiple notifications from the same app also cluster together, which cleans up the notification shade and makes it easier to see what’s what at a glance and dismiss en masse. The biggest functional change for notifications, however, is the wider roll out of quick reply functions. Google’s apps such as Messenger and Hangouts have had quick reply features for a while but now basically every communications app should have the feature. ADVERTISEMENT Users can hit reply from the notification and type their message directly into the box under the notification, which will also show a small snippet of the history of the conversation if you haven’t opened the app since the last reply. Faster toggles Google has also put a row of icons above notifications for toggling features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, screen rotation and similar, which can be quickly tapped without expanding to the full set of quick toggles. It reduces the number of swipes needed to turn off Wi-Fi, for instance, by one and is a simple, helpful new addition. You can customise what appears there, by modifying what’s in the top of the full quick toggles pane. Dragging down from the top with two fingers still opens up the full quick settings pane in one motion.

There are three ways to activate it. Pressing and holding the so-called overview button with one app on screen invokes the recently used apps list in a split-screen view to select a second app to put on screen. You can also do it from the recently used apps list by taping and holding one of the apps in the list and dragging to the top of the screen or the left or right-hand sides if in landscape, allowing you to pick the other app from the list. A hidden method activated in the System UI Tuner works by swiping up on the screen from the overview button. Once in split-screen mode, Nougat behaves similarly to Windows and iOS. Users can drag the black bar in the middle to change the size of the split, or remove it altogether. Pressing and holding the overview button, which shows as two halves when active, will cancel multi-window too. It works really well, with almost every app supporting it. Only a very small minority of apps actively block it, and those might be updated in the near future to support multi-window. It’s a feature that should have been there for a long time for Android tablets and makes them more productive as work machines. It’s less useful for smartphones, although landscape multi-window on large-screen phablets can be useful in situations where you need to keep an eye on two things simultaneously, such as a map and a conversation. Overview function Double-tapping the overview button will also switch straight to the last-used app, which makes bouncing between two apps a lot faster. Copy text or links between apps is now rapid. Other devices, including the OnePlus 3 have had this feature for a while, but it’s good to see it baked into Android. Battery life One of the best bits about Android 6.0 Marshmallow was the introduction of Doze, a feature that helped save battery when the phone or tablet wasn’t moving, such as being placed on a desk. It made a big difference to standby battery life. Android 7.0 Nougat applies the same battery-extending features to when the phone is moving too. When the screen is off, Nougat has much tighter controls on what can and can’t access data, how frequently and how often it wakes the phone up. The result is between 15 and 20 per cent longer battery life in my testing on a Nexus 6P. Facial recognition Google’s smart lock features have been around for a while. They use a combination of sensors to know when to deactivate the screen lock and when to make sure the passcode is always required. Facial recognition has been available for a while, but the trusted face system has significantly improved since Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is particularly useful for tablets and other devices without a fingerprint scanner. ADVERTISEMENT Using a Pixel C, the system went from slightly useful in the odd occasion when it worked to unlocking the device about 80 per cent of the time. In fact, the onlytimes it didn’t recognise my face were when I was wearing sunglasses and overly large headphones. Verdict Overall Android 7.0 Nougat is a great update. It makes some significant changes under the hood that provide benefits including longer battery life. The visual tweaks are subtle and most will likely be masked by the customisations made to Android by third-party manufacturers. The quick-reply additions to notifications feel like they should have been there from the start. But perhaps the best small tweak that all manufacturers should now adopt is the ability to double-tap the overview button to quickly jump between the last two used apps. It’s so much faster than bouncing to a menu and back, and takes no dexterity at all to activate. One thing is certain, however – if you didn’t like Android Marshmallow, Nougat isn’t going to do anything to change your mind. Google’s Nexus devices, including the Nexus 6, 5X, 6P, 9 and Nexus Player, as well as the Google Pixel C tablet, will receive the update over-the-air starting today. The LG V20 will be the first new smartphone to launch with Nougat due for release soon. – Guardian Service       Topics: Google Read More Three UK hit by data breach but no risk to Irish customers This week we’re talking about . . . fakebook Get smart with the Science Gallery Podcast Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Online reviews: what you read isn’t always what you get Research finds way to curb racist tweets Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Commercial Property Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Sport Olympic ticket agent Kevin Mallon must lodge €410,000 to get passport back Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 17:35 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 17:23 Builder Siac posts profits of €322,000 15:47 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 15:38 Organisations set to increase IT spend, survey shows 15:18 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Tech Tools: projector for use with smartphones Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Fool your children into activity by turning it into a game Prynt prints your smartphone photos – and adds video Tech Tools: It’s augmented reality meets actual reality with the help of Zink technology Smart wifi plug gives you the power to control the power Tech Tools: TP Link device means you can use home appliances from your smartphone Most Read in Business 1 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 2 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 3 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 4 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 5 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 6 UK chancellor Philip Hammond maps out post-Brexit future 7 Michael Noonan says ‘brass-plate operations’ will not be welcome 8 Loosening of mortgage rules will push up house prices, says Davy 9 Sorry millennials: Buying a home was just as hard for your parents 10 Thousands affected as RaboDirect axes investment funds Never miss a story.

Developers have been able to use an early version of the software since March. But over the coming weeks, the final iteration of Android 7.0 Nougat will be making its way to the Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C, and General Mobile 4G, which is part of Google’s Android One program. Any device enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also get the update, while LG’s V20 will be the first phone to come with the software out of the box when it debuts later this year. Android 7.0 Nougat brings several upgrades to Google’s mobile software, including 72 new emoji characters, the ability to open more than one app at the same time in separate windows, and support for Google’s mobile virtual reality platform, called Daydream, among other additions. Google says there are 250 new features in total. Google doesn’t typically allow developers to access the beta version of its new Android software so far ahead of its release. This year, however, the company gave app makers a longer lead time so they could optimize their software for the new platform closer to its official launch. Because Android is open source and available across a wide range of products made by different manufacturers, the wait for a new software update can sometimes take months depending on which phone you own. When Google releases a new version of Android, it must be approved, and, in some cases, modified by handset manufacturers and carriers before it arrives on your phone. This is why updates don’t reach all Android devices at the same time, as Apple’s iOS updates typically do for iPhones. The fact that Google has granted earlier access than usual to its beta program this year suggests it’s trying to expedite the rollout process moving forward.

Android N or Android Nougat was previewed by Google earlier this year and includes a new multi-window tool to view two apps side-by-side, improved battery life and wider encryption for personal data security among its new features. The software also expands its emoji library to over 1,500, and the announcement comes just weeks before rivals Apple are expected to update their iPhone and release an update to their own iOS software. The new Android software includes improved battery life and enhanced encryption " Today, we'll begin rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to Nexus devices," said Android's Sameer Samat. "And with more ways to make Android your own, it's by far our sweetest release yet. "We took a different approach to building and launching Nougat this year. For starters, we invited developers to take a sneak peek at Android N back in March, so they could bring their apps to the new platform earlier." Google also confirmed that alongside their own line of Nexus smartphones, the upcoming LG V20 would be the first devices to receive the update. Those users who are part of the Android Beta Program - which gives users early access to unfinished software - will also be able to receive Nougat first. Manufacturers including Sony, HTC, Samsung and Huawei all use Android as their smartphone software, though Google has not yet confirmed when Nougat will be widely available on these devices. The Nougat name comes from Google's tradition of naming their software updates alphabetically after "sweet treats" and follows 2015's Marshmallow update.

Here are its best new features The Android update includes side-by-side apps and can boost your battery life By Matthew Reynolds 22 Aug 2016 By Matthew Reynolds Monday 22 August 2016 Justin Sullivan / Getty The latest version of the Android OS is finally here. ADVERTISEMENT Google has confirmed it is rolling out its Nougat update to Nexus phones from today, although the release will be staggered over a few weeks depending on the model of Nexus phone you own. In the coming weeks, the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One) will get an over-the-air software update to Android 7.0 Nougat. Any devices enrolled in the Android Beta Program will also receive this final version. Read more Android Auto is now available for all drivers and cars Android Auto is now available for all drivers and cars By Amelia Heathman The upcoming LG V20 will additionally be the first new phone to come with Android Nougat out of the box. The rollout to other Android phones will follow, although owners may have to wait a while as Google has warned it will take ‘a while longer’ for users not on Nexus devices to get their hands on Nougat. More information can be found on the official Android Nougat support page. Google has teased us for months with information about its new operating system – originally codenamed Android N. Nougat follows in the footsteps of Android Marshmallow, released in October 2015, as the latest in a long line of treat-inspired operating systems.

From within side-by-side mode, users can resize windows to make it easier to copy information between apps.

A double tap of the ‘overview’ button will now flip between the two most recently used apps – a convenient upgrade for anyone who finds themselves frequently copying and pasting links from Chrome into WhatsApp. Following in iOS’s footsteps, Nougat also adds the ability to directly reply to notifications without opening any app at all. ADVERTISEMENT Fun and games Nougat brings 72 new emoji to Android, bringing the total number past 1,500 – more than enough to express how you're feeling. Google is also making Nougat better for mobile gaming, including support for Vulkan – a 3D rendering API that that powers next-generation immersive graphics. Nougat is ready for Google Daydream, its own virtual reality gaming platform. Productivity The quick settings menu has been rejigged to give users easier access to features such as Wi-Fi menus and the torch. With Android Nougat, users can move around quick settings tiles to suit their own priorities. Devices with Nougat will now also install software updates in the background and for current Nexus users, those software updates install much more quickly. Security Android Nougat comes with file-based encryption and will better isolate and protect files for individual users on your device. Elsewhere, its Direct Boot feature helps your device startup faster, and apps run securely even before you unlock your device when your device reboots. Boosted battery life The Doze feature has been given an intelligent upgrade too. Now phones running Android Nougat will drop into lower power usage mode when they’re being jostled around in a pocket or bag, helping stretch your phone’s battery until you reach a charging point.

We know because, well, since Friday morning, the site has published a whopping eight articles about the app (in that order). A few days ago we told you about a couple of features the site detailed (including the app’s hilarious sticker packs), but we weren’t expecting the flood of information published over the weekend. Now, we’re expecting at least another 8 articles before the end of the week… I hope it’s clear that my snark here is all in good fun as it’s undeniable that Rita El Khoury has done a great job unpacking this app for the Google enthusiasts among us. And since this is Google’s first actual attempt at penetrating the flooded messaging market since Hangouts, I think the in-depth coverage is justifiable. So what exactly have we learned? If you don’t have time to read her reports in full (or if you’re simply not all that interested in the app and/or having to convince your friends to download yet another messaging client), here’s our little summary of what we know: There are sticker packs There’s going to be some hilarious sticker packs. The app will come with 3 installed by default, and you can add more if you want later. At the time of launch, it looks like there’s going to be 24 additional packs available from a variety of designers, and each one packs 24 stickers. The most notable pack is the “Julio the Bull” pack, which speaks for itself. You can delete messages You’ll be able to delete messages, although you can’t “take back” something you already sent. This just deletes messages from your device. Select a message, and the top bar changes to give you four options: share, forward, copy, and delete. Messages that contain media will give you the option to “Remove media from my device” when deleting the message. Voice messaging looks a lot like WhatsApp Voice messaging in Allo works about as you’d expect. You tap-and-hold the microphone icon in the bottom-right, and a blue bubble pops up letting you know that you’re recording. The bottom left shows you how long your recording is, and swiping to the left while recording cancels the message. Lifting your finger sends. Interestingly, this is almost exactly how voice messaging works in WhatsApp. You can send GIFs and annotate images Allo will let you send GIFs, and it seems to work well. Hangouts lets you do this, yes, but this implementation seems better. You simply tap the button to add media to the Allo chat, and you’ll see GIFs animating in the media picker and the preview before you send. There’s also a barebones Snapchat-like ability to annotate static images in the app. You can choose between six different colors to draw on top of the image, or tap a button to add text. There’s also a nifty undo button. As for some more interesting tidbits about the media sharing capabilities, it appears that videos sent via the app do not play inline as GIFs do. You’ll also find that you can multiple-select images and media, and that images are automatically saved in an “Allo Media” folder on your phone (but you can disable this feature). Allo is also tied to your Google account It’s been a common complaint that Allo — from the start — would be connected to your phone number rather than your Google account. Now, it appears it also connects to your Google account — albeit not in the way that you might hope. When you first sign into Allo, you still use only your phone number, and that is still the only way people can find you on Allo. But it appears the app also uses your Google account to personalize the information it provides via Google Assistant. So if you were hoping this meant that Allo would still support using the same message threads across multiple devices, this is still bad news. Allo lets you search your conversations It appears that Allo lets you quickly and easily search for contacts or text within your conversations — within the app. That’s something that Hangouts has long needed. Android Police says that searching in the app is “extensive” and allows you to search for text that was shared by Google Assistant, as well as navigate multiple results in a single chat thread with easy arrow buttons. Incognito mode supports expiring messages Besides what we already knew about the Incognito mode in Allo, it’s also now clear that you can set expirations for messages sent via the app. This setting can be set to a variety of different times that can be changed by either participant: completely off, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, or 1 week. These messages are of course encrypted end-to-end, but now we also know that you can’t screenshot Incognito chats and that notifications are private. Allo might not backup your chats The early version of Allo that all this information has been coming from has an interesting feature (or anti-feature): all of your chat history disappears if you ever uninstall and reinstall the app. It’s definitely possible that this is something that will change when the app goes primetime, but for now it looks like there’s no cloud backup feature to be found. Apparently, the only things you’ll be left with when you uninstall are the groups you were part of and a ghost Allo Media folder. That’s it! And that’s all we have for now, folks. I’m sure there will be more information that pours out as the full release of Allo draws nearer, but now we at least have this one post that we’ll keep updated for you. In the meantime, you should go check out Google Duo, Allo’s sibling, which already launched and offers a super-simple way to have video calls with other people across platforms.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Samuel Gibbs Monday 22 August 2016 13.00 EDT Last modified on Thursday 13 October 2016 16.04 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Android 7.0 Nougat is the new version of Google’s mobile operating system, used by billions of devices around the world. It features longer battery life, improved multitasking and smarter notifications in a slimmed down and refined Android experience – following on the work done in last year’s version 6 Marshmallow It is faster, more polished and a subtly-better experience all-round. Apps install more quickly, the OS can be smaller in size and updates to Android can be installed on the fly, without having to wait for 10 minutes while it reboots, if you have a new device. The new Vulcan API graphics system is also baked in for better gaming performance and Nougat will support Google’s Daydream virtual reality system, eventually. Nougat is not, however, a major visual overhaul of Android. Those that have used Marshmallow on any of Google’s Nexus smartphones or devices with little in the way of modification to Android, such as the OnePlus 3, will instantly recognise it. This review was conducted using a pre-release version of Nougat running on various Google Nexus and Pixel devices, as such some small things may vary on the production version of Nougat released today. Improved notifications Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nougat makes quick replies default for almost all communication-based notifications. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Most of the work has gone on behind the scenes but the one obvious change in Nougat is to notifications. They’re now flatter and wider, filling the entire width of the screen on a smartphone, and joined directly to each other, which wastes less space than Marshmallow’s card-like appearance. Multiple notifications from the same app also cluster together, which cleans up the notification shade and makes it easier to see what’s what at a glance and dismiss en masse. The biggest functional change for notifications, however, is the wider roll out of quick reply functions. Google’s apps such as Messenger and Hangouts have had quick reply features for a while but now basically every communications app should have the feature. Users can hit reply from the notification and type their message directly into the box under the notification, which will also show a small snippet of the history of the conversation if you haven’t opened the app since the last reply. Quicker quick toggles Facebook Twitter Pinterest The first stage of the notification shade pull down now includes a top row of quick toggles, which then pulled down again reveal the whole lot. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Above notifications Google has also put a row of icons for toggling features such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, screen rotation and similar, which can be quickly tapped without expanding to the full set of quick toggles. It reduces the number of swipes needed to turn off Wi-Fi, for instance, by one and is a simple, helpful new addition. You can customise what appears there, by modifying what’s in the top of the full quick toggles pane. Dragging down from the top with two fingers still opens up the full quick settings pane in one motion. Multi-window Facebook Twitter Pinterest Multi-window makes Android tablets more useful for productivity and can be used either in landscape or portrait. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Multi-window, or side-by-side split screen support, is the other big new functional addition. There are three ways to activate it. Pressing and holding the so-called overview button with one app on screen invokes the recently used apps list in a split-screen view to select a second app to put on screen. You can also do it from the recently used apps list by taping and holding one of the apps in the list and dragging to the top of the screen or the left or right-hand sides if in landscape, allowing you to pick the other app from the list. A hidden method activated in the System UI Tuner works by swiping up on the screen from the overview button. Once in split-screen mode, Nougat behaves similarly to Windows and iOS. Users can drag the black bar in the middle to change the size of the split, or remove it altogether. Pressing and holding the overview button, which shows as two halves when active, will cancel multi-window too. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Portrait multi-window mode on a smartphone isn’t very useful, but landscape split-screen can be useful on larger devices. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian It works really well, with almost every app supporting it. Only a very small minority of apps actively block it, and those might be updated in the near future to support multi-window. It’s a feature that should have been there for a long time for Android tablets and makes them more productive as work machines. It’s less useful for smartphones, although landscape multi-window on large-screen phablets can be useful in situations where you need to keep an eye on two things simultaneously, such as a map and a conversation. Double tap overview to switch to most recent app Double-tapping the overview button will also switch straight to the last-used app, which makes bouncing between two apps a lot faster. Copy text or links between apps is now rapid. Other devices, including the OnePlus 3 have had this feature for a while, but it’s good to see it baked into Android. Longer battery life thanks to Doze 2.0 One of the best bits about Android 6.0 Marshmallow was the introduction of Doze, a feature that helped save battery when the phone or tablet wasn’t moving, such as being placed on a desk. It made a big difference to standby battery life. Android 7.0 Nougat applies the same battery-extending features to when the phone is moving too. When the screen is off, Nougat has much tighter controls on what can and can’t access data, how frequently and how often it wakes the phone up. The result is between 15 and 20% longer battery life in my testing on a Nexus 6P. Facial recognition improvements Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nougat improves Android’s smartlock feature, making face matching significantly faster and more accurate. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Google’s smart lock features have been around for a while. They use a combination of sensors to know when to deactivate the screen lock and when to make sure the passcode is always required. Facial recognition has been available for a while, but the trusted face system has significantly improved since Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is particularly useful for tablets and other devices without a fingerprint scanner. Using a Pixel C, the system went from slightly useful in the odd occasion when it worked to unlocking the device about 80% of the time. In fact, the onlytimes it didn’t recognise my face were when I was wearing sunglasses and overly large headphones. Verdict Overall Android 7.0 Nougat is a great update. It makes some significant changes under the hood that provide benefits including longer battery life. The visual tweaks are subtle and most will likely be masked by the customisations made to Android by third-party manufacturers. The quick-reply additions to notifications feel like they should have been there from the start. But perhaps the best small tweak that all manufacturers should now adopt is the ability to double-tap the overview button to quickly jump between the last two used apps. It’s so much faster than bouncing to a menu and back, and takes no dexterity at all to activate. One thing is certain, however – if you didn’t like Android Marshmallow, Nougat isn’t going to do anything to change your mind.

Next Story Android Nougat begins rolling out to Nexus devices today Apps Google Software Reviews Android Tech Review Android 7.0 Nougat review: great, but does it matter? Want the latest? Get a Nexus By Dieter Bohn on August 22, 2016 01:00 pm @backlon 331 Tweet Share Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share Google has announced that the latest version of Android, 7.0 Nougat, is rolling out to newer Nexus devices starting today. It’s a good upgrade, but only available if you have a recent Nexus device like the Nexus 6, 6P, 5X, Pixel C, or Nexus 9 tablet — and it will take some time for everybody's devices to receive the over-the-air update. I've been using the various public betas that have been running since March of this year and most of the bugs have been worked out. Nougat isn’t radically different from the last version, Marshmallow, but does add a handful of notable user-facing features. Some of them, like improved multitasking, are long overdue and really useful on tablets. The rest are tweaks around the edges — but there are bigger changes underneath that should make Android faster and more secure, too. But the story of Nougat isn't really whether it’s any good. Instead, it’s the same old Android tale: unless you have a Nexus, it could be a few months, it could be a year, before it becomes available on your phone. The real story of Nougat isn't happening today, it's going to happen over the next few months as we watch to see which Android phones will actually be updated. What kind of story is this? For Nexus owners, it’s a heartwarming yarn. For nearly everybody else, it’s a mystery. Multitasking With Nougat, Google has added a major feature that's been a long time coming: split-screen support. It's been available on Samsung, Apple, and Windows devices for some time now, and now Google has weighed in with a system-level version of it that will hopefully become well-supported by all apps. It also works on phones instead of just on tablets — which is smart given how big a lot of Android phones are these days. It works thusly: you long-press the square "Overview" button and your main window slides up to the top or over to the left, depending on whether you are using your Android device in portrait or landscape. In the remaining space, you get the good old multitasking view of your open apps, where you can either pick one or hit the home button to launch something else. You can adjust the size of each window and switch out the bottom / right one the usual way, by tapping the multitasking or home button to choose another app. Every mobile split-screen system takes a bit of getting used to. The UX for all of them is confusing at first, and so Nougat's variation also takes some time to understand. For me, it clicked when I realized that the core behavior going into split screen is essentially the same as "pinning" the main app to the top or left, and then the other screen can be switched as usual. Split screen is long overdue on tablets Once you get it, there are just the devils in the details to worry about. Theoretically, you can drag and drop text or images in supported apps, but in practice I never got this to work reliably. Some apps don’t fully support split screen, while others work fine but pop up a warning anyway. One nice bit: Chrome now has a menu option called "Move to other window" which does exactly what it says — so you can have two browser windows open side by side. I find that split screen is essential and useful on a tablet like the Pixel C. Thanks to Nougat, the Pixel C has gone from a device that made next to no sense to a device that makes just enough sense to consider (but really only if you're wholly invested in the Android ecosystem). On a phone it's a little less important than on a tablet, but nevertheless really helpful in a pinch. There is another multitasking tweak that I found myself using all the time, though. Double tapping the square button immediately switches to the last-used app. I hadn't realized how much of my app switching comprised just toggling between two recent apps, and now that I can do it so easily I can't really imagine going back. Last and least: Nougat reduces the number of apps that appear in the multitasking view and adds a "clear all" button at the top of it. Google's recommendation has long been that there's no need to quit out of apps to improve Android's performance and I don't see any reason that would be different in Nougat. But if you like getting rid of things, well, have at it. Notifications Besides multitasking, the other notable interface change comes with notifications. Nougat finally has a system-level way for apps to let you quick-reply to messages right inside their notifications. It works as you'd expect: when you get a message, you can drag down on the card, tap reply, and then type and send — all without opening the app. Notifications are now full-width on the screen and stacked right atop each other instead of appearing as separated cards. You can do more with them, too: apps can "bundle" multiple alerts into a single notification, which can then be expanded by dragging down on it. It’s a smart system that I like using: you can triage notifications quickly or interact with them one by one, depending on your needs. A long press brings up notification options for that app, which makes it much easier to quiet noisy apps. You can still dismiss notifications by swiping them away, of course. And Nougat also continues one of Android's best notification features: they act exactly the same whether you're in the notification drawer, the lock screen, or seeing them drop down from the top of your screen. Those last two things — swiping to dismiss and consistent behavior no matter where you're seeing the notification — are features that Apple still hasn't figured out on iOS (even in the upcoming iOS 10 beta). Android has long had an advantage in useful and consistent notifications, and now that quick replies are standard on it I don't see that lead diminishing. Tweaks: for better and worse The other thing to say about notifications is that Google has finally figured out that everybody wants to just see the quick settings panel at the top of the notifications tray right away. So now there are buttons across the top for your most-used settings toggles and you can customize their order, too. This is also where you'll find Nougat's Easter egg, a little game that lets you put treats out for virtual cats. There are lots more nips and tucks throughout the new Android OS. The settings app is a little more informative now — it shows key details right on the main screen. There's a Data Saver feature for limiting what apps can do when you're on a cellular connection. Google's keyboard — not technically tied to Nougat — can be themed with different colors or even a photo. There are more emoji with proper support for multiple skin tones. The camera app has been cleaned up a bit — and now you can twist the phone like a screwdriver when the camera is open to quickly swap between the front and rear camera. All of these tiny changes move Android in the right direction, making it more functional without adding too much visual complexity. Weirdly, my biggest gripe about Nougat is related to the thing you'd expect Android to be stupendously good at: Google search. It's kind of a mess. Google Now doesn't really seem to be getting any better at figuring out what information will be useful to me. Google Now On Tap is still pretty frustrating: it’s supposed to figure out what's on the screen and return relevant results, but usually returns no results or, at best, not very good ones. But even setting that aside, the Google search app itself just seems lost and disconnected from the rest of the operating system. When you search, it puts the results into its own custom browser window that feels custom-designed for one-off searches instead of persistent research. When you Google, how often are you opening results in tabs? I do it all the time, but it's a huge hassle on Nougat. I wrote last month that Google's apps seem better on the iPhone than they do on Android, and the Google app itself is the prime candidate. It's worst on the Pixel C, because hitting the search button on the keyboard now just brings up Now On Tap. Which means it reads the screen, fails to figure anything out, and then forces you to tap the search field to start typing. Then, when you do, it pulls up the Google app for search results. And, incredibly, the Google app doesn't support split screen — which means that every time you search, the windows you have open are banished to the multitasking screen. Behind the screens A lot of what's new in Nougat are features you can’t really see. I'm talking about deeply nerdy (but important) stuff like a JIT compiler for ART apps and support for the Vulkan API for 3D graphics. The former should provide some performance gains while the latter will help Android games look way better. Google also fixed up the way Android handles media so that it's more secure, added file-based encryption, and added some features for enterprise users. VR on Android will come later this year Doze, which was introduced in last year’s Marshmallow OS, is Android's battery-saving feature that shuts apps down when they're not it use. Previously, it kicked in when your phone or tablet was sitting on a table. Now, it throttles stuff back whenever your screen is off. It should be a boon for battery life, but it’s hard for me to really say how much it will help just yet. Even though Google assures me the only difference between the final beta and the official version are minor bug fixes, I still feel like beta software can be rough on battery life. I haven’t noticed battery life being significantly better on my Nexus 5X. My favorite structural improvement is also the one most richly steeped in Schadenfreude: seamless updates. Like Google's Chrome OS, future Android devices will ship with two storage partitions for the OS. That allows Google to quietly send your phone a whole new operating system and install it on the partition that isn't running your phone. When it's done and checked out, the next time you reboot, the new version starts working and the old version sits there — waiting to be replaced with the next version. It's a super smart system and will mean that future Android updates will happen with much less waiting and worry. Except that, well, if you don’t have a Nexus device there’s no telling when or even if you’ll get an operating system update. My gripes about the Google App aside, overall I am happy with Nougat. Think of it along the lines of the smaller updates we get every other year on Mac or the way that Microsoft is treating Windows updates today: it's a little bit iterative, but builds the groundwork for future updates. One of those future updates will be Daydream, Google's upcoming VR platform. It's not part of this Nougat release, so I haven't addressed it here (and a disclosure: my wife works for Oculus so I won't be addressing it when it is released). But, as I mentioned early on, the bigger story here is not whether Nougat is a worthwhile OS update; it is. No, the real story is which phones will receive it and when. We don't know how long it will be before a significant number of users have access to it, either via upgrades to existing devices or support from upcoming devices. All we can do is read the tea leaves. No matter who you blame, the Android update situation is still a mess This is a very old story, it’s something Android users have always and will continue to deal with. At the risk of belaboring it, let me just tell some small parts again. Only 15 percent of devices are on last year's version of Android Marshmallow. Android has been rocked by serious security problems in the past year, and so the debate around updates has shifted from being about users who want the latest features to being about users who need to be protected from hackers and malware. So instead of asking about the latest version of Android, we're asking about the new monthly security updates that Google is issuing. And the answers to that new, less ambitious but more important question are not good, as Android Central pointed out in February. Now, buying a new Android phone demands that the consumer look into whether the manufacturer has committed to those monthly updates and if it has a good history of keeping that promise (so far: Samsung, HTC, and BlackBerry are doing pretty well, Moto and Sony are not). It's possible that this time will be different, but I’m not optimistic. Every year Google tries a different tactic to strong-arm manufacturers and carriers into updating their phones. The latest is a surprisingly early developer beta program for Android N — it was first released way back in March. Maybe that will help, and there is at least one good sign: the LG V20 will be launching with Android Nougat before Google launches the next Nexus phones. It’s a start, but right now the burden of proof is on Google to convince us that more will follow. The only reliable way to be up to date is to get a Nexus We've all become inured to the reality that the only real way to reliably get the latest version of Android is to get a Nexus phone. Luckily, Google has mostly been doing a pretty good job with its Nexus line lately. CEO Sundar Pichai has promised that Google would be "more opinionated" about the design of Nexus phones going forward. I'm very curious to see exactly what that means — and whether that opinion extends to trying harder to sell more Nexus phones. I'm curious because given how recalcitrant manufacturers and carriers have been about updating Android and given how ineffectual Google has been at forcing them to do so, selling more Nexus phones looks like the only way Google has left to reliably get people on its latest Android operating system. It’s been a problem for as long as Android has been around and even though it’s not new, it’s still a problem. Nougat is a solid update, it’s a shame it will take so long for anybody to see it.

One of the Android Nougat update’s biggest additions for tablets and large-screened phones is its new split-screen multitasking mode. Samsung has supported its own version of this feature for years, and Apple added it to newer iPads in the iOS 9 update, but official Google support for it should make it usable on just about anything that runs Nougat. Google hasn’t changed anything about the implementation since we first took a look at the feature in the earliest Nougat beta—that article and the video above lay out the basics of what it’s capable of and what it’s like to use. Now that I’ve had some time to play with the near-final version of the feature on a Nexus 9, I can say that the biggest pain point (as long as you have a fast phone or tablet) is going to be third-party app support. Resolution independence in iOS is just a couple of years old, which meant that there were still many apps that didn't support Split View multitasking when iOS 10 came out. But resolution independence has been baked into Android for much longer, so pretty much any app you download is going to support multitasking even if it hasn't been updated in years. The only exceptions are apps that run in full-screen mode (most games do this) or apps in which developers have explicitly disabled the enabled-by-default android:resizableActivity property. But as with many things on Android, this is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, those lucky enough to have the Nougat update early can enjoy multitasking from day one regardless of what apps they use. On the other, few apps will be optimized for multitasking. In the best, most harmless cases, this will just mean putting up with intermittent warning messages. In other cases, you’ll find that apps don’t actually refresh themselves unless the app has focus—tap away from your messaging app to work in Word or browse in Chrome, for example, and you may stop seeing new messages until you tab back over to your messaging app. Crashes and instability were common during my testing as well. When it’s working well, split screen multitasking on an Android tablet really does make the operating system feel more productive, just as the equivalent iOS 9 feature made iPads feel more productive. But “official” support from many apps may take time to roll out—Android apps tend to adopt new features more slowly than iOS apps, due in part to Android’s fragmented ecosystem. And while most apps work OK without any effort on their developer’s part, you’re still going to run into problems while you wait on the app ecosystem to catch up to Google.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Android Nougat drops support for Nexus 5 and 2013 Nexus 7 Both should have a couple more months of security patches left, at least. by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 22, 2016 5:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 162 Enlarge / The Nexus 5X (left) and Nexus 5 (right) will run the same software no longer. Andrew Cunningham It's official: The Nexus 5 and 2013 Nexus 7 won't receive the Android 7.0 Nougat update from Google today. The update will roll out to the Nexus 6, 9, 5X, 6P, the Pixel C tablet, the Nexus Player, and the General Mobile 4G (an Android One phone that has been included in the beta program), but older gadgets will remain on Marshmallow. Neither device was supported by the Android N developer beta builds that Google has been releasing all summer, and both are past the point when new major Android updates are guaranteed (July and October of 2015 for the Nexus 7 and 5, respectively). But the beta support list is not always indicative of the final support list. Google has provided updates outside of that 18-month window before. Google provides its monthly security patches either three years after a device's release date or 18 months after the end of general availability, whichever is longer. According to the dates listed on Wikipedia, that ought to cover both of them until October 2016 or so, at which point both devices may be left behind for good. Nexus 5 owners who want to stay updated have some options. The Nexus 5X is nearly a year old, but it's still a solid phone, and it goes on sale pretty regularly at this point. And rumor has it that one of the upcoming HTC-made Nexus phones will have a 5-inch screen, too. Sadly, Nexus 7 users don't have an easy Nexus upgrade path since both the Nexus 9 and Pixel C were significantly larger and more expensive. There are no rumors of a new small-screened Nexus tablet on the horizon. Even if people use those older Nexuses for another year or two, they'll still be running a newer version of the OS than the vast majority of the Android ecosystem. And the Nexus devices' easily unlockable bootloaders and wide use among developers make them popular among the ROM development community. So you'll be able to find Nougat builds floating around if you're equipped (and brave enough) to install them. But it's too bad that the support lifecycle of the most consistently updated Android devices is so much shorter than what Apple achieves with iOS, especially since the hardware should still be more than capable of supporting Nougat.

By Todd Haselton | August 22, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Google just announced that the final version of Android 7.0 Nougat is now rolling out to Nexus smartphones and tablets around the world. That includes the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, the Pixel C and the General Mobile 4G. Google said that, while the update is beginning today, it may take several weeks for it to hit every device, so keep that in mind. We covered Android 7.0 Nougat extensively as it moved through the beta process, so most of you probably already know what to expect. Still, you should find support for multi-windows, the option to reply to messages direct from the notification, a new Quick Switch function for changing apps, more than 1,500 different emoji (72 are new in Nougat) and a huge focus on security. Additionally, Google said Android Nougat was built with support for Vulkan and Daydream, the former of which is taken advantage of on new Samsung smartphones. Daydream is Nougat’s native support for a new VR experience. Google confirmed that the first retail device with Nougat will be the LG V20, which seems to suggest that we’ll have to wait until after September 6 before we see new Nexus devices. If you own one of the aforementioned devices, you can check for Nougat in the settings menu now.

Google spent all those years trying to work out what people wanted in a smartphone. A few features, like homescreen widgets and that pull-down notification shade, have been around since day one. But it took two versions before Android had an on-screen keyboard (!) and three before the so-called omnibox let you search your phone, the web, and more all from Google’s white search box. Multitasking didn’t really exist until Ice Cream Sandwich. There were lots of ideas in between, most of them bad. The oldest version of Android that looks even remotely like what’s now on your phone is probably KitKat, which didn’t come out until 2013. Nougat makes clear that Google now knows exactly what it’s doing. A lot has changed recently, though. Or, rather, not much has changed—and that’s a good thing. The latest version of Android, called Nougat (shoulda been Nun’s Farts), is the latest upgrade to the software that’s now used on more than three-quarters of all smartphones in the world. It’s slowly rolling out to Google’s Nexus devices starting today. (It’ll come to other phones, too, eventually, but if history is any guide you’re going to have to buy a new phone if you want to see what Nougat’s all about.) Unlike the many Android sweetmeats that came before—from Cupcake to Honeycomb to Jelly Bean—Nougat makes clear that Google now knows exactly what it’s doing. Just Desserts Nougat is polished, refined, and mature. It exists in a smartphone market that is all of those things too, which means Google’s no longer grasping at straws trying to make Android work on a hundred different device types and screen sizes. The market chose big screens and software keyboards. Everyone knows how to use smartphones, and with a decade of data in its hands Google knows too. Nougat’s not a terribly exciting update, honestly—its most noteworthy features are more about TVs and wearables than smartphones—but it’s further evidence that Google has locked onto the way forward for smartphone software. And it’s definitely the best version of Android ever. There are only a handful of truly new features in Nougat. The one you’ll probably use most is the new emoji: Google finally ditched those blobby yellow characters for actual, you know, people. Nougat has 72 new emoji, too, including avocado, scooter, bacon, selfie, and clown face (which is horrifying and you should please never send it to me). Beyond that, the most important new thing is the side-by-side window support, which lets you open two apps on the screen at the same time. I originally expected to never use multiple windows on a phone-sized screen, but it’s great for copying addresses to my calendar or watching a video while I burn through some email on the train. And as long as you have a recent-ish phone with a recent-ish processor, it works without a hitch. Google While we’re on the subject of multitasking, it’s worth noting the way Nougat tweaks app-switching. Instead of showing you your most recent apps when you hit the square button on the right side—including the app you’re currently in, which is redundant and dumb and redundant—it shows you the app you were using before. Or you can skip the menu altogether by just double-tapping the square button and jumping straight to your most recently used app. As always, notifications got some tweaking in the new version of Android. Google seems to know that notifications are a huge advantage over iOS, and just keeps extending the lead. Now you can take more action in a notification, archiving or snoozing or replying directly without ever even opening the app. Getting notifications you don’t need? Long-press on one and change the settings right there. You can group like notifications, re-order them in terms of priority, and more. If you use Android, you probably spend more time in notifications than anywhere else—that’s only going to grow. Sweetening the Deal None of these features will inspire you to fling your iPhone from the top of the Burj Khalifa while shouting, “Finally, Android has what I need!” Nor will the new dark mode, or the ability to edit which settings show up at the top of the notification shade. Personally, I’m sold on the whole thing just because I can pin Google Keep and Inbox to the top of the sharing menu, but you’re probably not as excited about that as I am. That’s OK! The Android team doesn’t need to have more wild new ideas about everything. In fact it’s better not to. Our phones are too important to fiddle with for fiddling’s sake. Google Right now, iOS is making big changes—but virtually all those changes are Apple catching up to the openness and interconnectedness that has made Android so successful. Meanwhile, Android’s in the spit-shining phase: it’s mature and finished, but it could always be a little cleaner and prettier. The new settings that help you save more data, or more battery, or more time, are all deeply un-sexy. Each makes Android better, in the small ways Android can still get better. None of this is to say there’s nothing left to do, of course. I still think Android has a toolbar-overload problem, and it keeps adding fiddly bits without making it easier for average users to find them. And given that a huge part of Nougat is its VR mode, meant to support Google’s Daydream VR platform coming later this year, there are still opportunities for Google to be weird and ambitious. But for you, dear Android phone owner, Nougat offers only the small and subtle progress of an already excellent smartphone OS. When it comes to my smartphone, where I work and play and sext and watch The Americans, I’ll take that over reckless reinvention any day. Go Back to Top.

The new software includes tweaks that Google says will improve battery life, allow users more options for customising the phone, and improve productivity. However, the update is at first available only for the Nexus line of phones and LG’s upcoming V20 phone. Devices from Samsung and others are likely to get the updates in the coming months. Here’s what’s new: Better notifications You will now be able to reply to messages and emails directly from the notification itself, preventing you from having to open an app simply to send a “sounds good” or “see you then”. This Direct Reply feature is up to the individual apps to implement: although Google’s own apps such as Hangouts will have the feature from the start. Nougat's Direct Reply feature Credit: Google You can now also long press on notifications to choose to hide them in future. Quick settings The Quick Settings menu that emerges when you pull down from the top of the screen has been tweaked to allow you to choose the most relevant settings. When you swipe down, instead of seeing the whole menu, you’ll see just the icons for Wi-Fi, mobile data, battery, do not disturb and flashlight. You can then open up the full menu by clicking the down arrow and choosing the settings you use the most. If you turn Bluetooth on and off a lot, for example, you can bring that up near the top. Multitasking Android Nougat introduces a split-screen view that, for example, allows you to watch YouTube in one window and Twitter in another. Simply hold down the recent apps button to launch the current app in splitscreen mode. The new splitscreen mode You’ll be able to select a second app to splitscreen with and can slide the divider to change how much screen is taken up. This works especially well if you have the phone in landscape mode. Some manufacturers who put extra features on top of Android, such as Samsung, have included this for some time, but now it is being made universal. Double tapping the recent apps button switches between the two most recently-used apps. Battery life Google has improved Doze, the battery-saving feature it introduced with Android Marshmallow last year that limited the battery usage of some apps when they weren’t being used. When the phone’s screen is turned off, or it is being moved around as if in a pocket or bag, apps will be put into a further “deep doze” mode to save even more juice. Everything else 72 new emoji have been introduced, including clown face, bacon and facepalm Nougat has more support for virtual reality and high-speed games thanks to two new platforms: Daydream and Vulkan Further software updates will install a lot quicker What devices are available and how do I get it? Over the coming weeks, Android Nougat will be available for: Nexus 6 Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus 9 Pixel C Nexus Player General Mobile 4G Google’s upcoming phones will also come with Nougat, as will the upcoming LG V20. The update will gradually be made available to newer devices from other manufacturers in the coming months, although it is unclear which phones will get the update and when. How to get it You should get a notification when your update is ready, but to check, go to Settings, About phone/tablet, System updates and Check for update. If you don't want to wait, you can enroll in the Beta programme now at this link. Sign in with the account connected to your phone and you should get a notification almost instantly allowing you to download Nougat. best android apps   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Android Google Show more Technology latest 23 Nov 2016, 4:30pm Parking chaos as payment app RingGo offline across the country  23 Nov 2016, 11:24am Facebook 'prepares to suppress posts in bid to enter China' 23 Nov 2016, 11:02am How much of the UK has mobile phone coverage?

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40. They are in my queue to write about » reply Don't forget the poaching of Apple's talent Submitted by Mario Herger (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 19:41.

Then the billboards all over highway 101 about the nano-degree in self-driving by Sebastian Thrun's Udacity It's astonishing the tempo that this has taken and accelerating... » reply ... but Apple also picked up an entire company's worth of PhDs Submitted by David Rostcheck (not verified) on Mon, 2016-08-22 08:52. Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker? I heard it here (webinar on high definition maps) http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation/automot... » reply Taxi model Submitted by Bejoy (not verified) on Mon, 2016-09-12 02:45. Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Often reserved for developers, the big change with the Nougat release is that Google has been very open and sharing about it. Google has confirmed the roll-out of Android 7.0 Nougat has now started. To keep things simple, we've broken it down for you, so you can get to exactly the information you need.  Android 7.0 Nougat: Release date On 22 August 2016, Google confirmed the roll-out of the final release version of Android 7.0 Nougat. There's no official dates or timeframe for the roll-out to Nexus devices, but Google has said that updates will be pushed over the "coming weeks." Google also hasn't specified when the factory images will be released, but they are often made available for those who want to manually flash devices in advance of over the air updates. Android 7.0 Nougat: What Nexus devices are supported? Android Nougat will be available on the following devices as an over the air update.  Nexus 6 Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus 9 Nexus Player Pixel C General Mobile 4G (Android One) If you have any of those devices, you'll be able to sit back and relax and wait for the update to arrive. Android 7.0 Nougat: What happens to Beta Program users? Google has confirmed that anyone on the Beta Program will be also receive the final version of Android 7.0.  Whether this will include those using the Sony Xperia Z3 as a preview device isn't yet confirmed. Android 7.0 Nougat: What about new Nexus launches? What about indeed. Google has made no mention of new Nexus devices. Normally a new version of Android launches on a new handset and this year things appear to be a little different.  We've been following the rumours surrounding the Nexus Marlin and Nexus Sailfish devices, so we can only assume that they will be releasing closer to normal Nexus update schedule at the end of September. Android 7.0 Nougat: What about the LG V20? LG announced that the LG V20 - due to be released in early September - would be the first new device to run Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. This has been confirmed by Google, who says that it will indeed be the first new phone to offer Android's latest software. Just as HTC managed to launch the HTC One A9 on Marshmallow soon after launch, it now looks like it's LG's turn. Android 7.0 Nougat: What new features are there? Android Nougat adds a whole host of new features, sticking very much to the foundation that Marshmallow laid down visually, by making it easier to get to a lot more information. There's tweaks to notifications, to Doze, to the settings menu and quick settings options, as well as native support for Daydream VR.  Android 7.0 Nougat: Want to know more? We've been tracking the changes through the Android N Beta Program, so you can read our preview of the software experience right here. Intrigued by the talk of split-screen working? You can watch it in action right here, as we give you a walk-through of one of Android Nougat's biggest new features. The roll-out of Android Nougat to other Android devices - e.g. Samsung or HTC - will come over the next few months. Head over to our upgrade guide to see when you'll be getting Android 7.0 Nougat. Want a quick rundown of Android Nougat's new features? We've rounded up 7 Nougat features for you to get excited about. HTC is rumoured to be manufacturing two new Nexus devices, codenamed Marlin and Sailfish. Catch up on all the rumours and see exactly what Google has in store.

Here's a run down of some of the things to get excited about. 1. Revamped quick settings The quick settings have been refreshed, giving you the opportunity to change the order that they appear, as well as add and remove those you don't want. 2. Settings menu refresh The Settings menu has had a thorough overhaul in Android 7.0. More information has been bubbled up, so it's easier to see information at a glance and save you constantly tapping through. The settings menu will also give you notifications and suggestions to help you get more from your device. 3. Split-screen apps At last Android is going to be supporting split-screen natively. Offered by companies like Samsung for some time, the Google solution is similar, letting you pop an app into the top of the display and open a second. You can change the sizes too, helping you get the most from your apps and display. The recent apps button now has a new lease of live.  4. Quick switching between apps We've all got used to hitting the recent apps button and selecting a different app from the deck. But with Android Nougat, a double tap on the recent apps button will let you switch between your two most often-used apps. Want to play Pokemon Go and keep that WhatsApp conversation going? It's now much simpler. 5. Save more power Android Marshmallow introduced Doze, a system feature that will let your device go to sleep and save power when it's not being used – it really works, but your phone needed to be still for it to work. In Nougat this has now been super-charged, letting you save power when on the move. Doze in Nougat won't need your phone to be still. 6. Designed for Daydream Love Google Cardboard? Get ready to scrap it as Google changes gear on VR. The new Daydream platform will be designed with specific hardware in mind to ensure a better mobile VR experience. The good news is that Daydream support is natively baked into Nougat, and ready to roll.  7. Notifications are more informative Android is notifications and it offers the best mobile notifications you'll find. In Nougat, notifications are richer, with more information. Direct reply is also going mainstream. Messenger and WhatsApp have allowed direct replying without opening the app and this will be widespread across more Android apps in the future.

New implementation of mass indexer using JSR 352 Posted by Mincong Huang    |    Aug 22, 2016    |    Tagged as Hibernate Search Discussions Hi, I’m Mincong, an engineering student from France. I’m glad to present my Google Summer of Code 2016 project, which provides an alternative to the current mass indexer implementation of Hibernate Search, using the Java Batch architecture (JSR 352). I’ve been working on this project for 4 months. Before getting started, I want to thank Google for sponsoring the project, the Hibernate team for accepting my proposal and my mentors Gunnar and Emmanuel for their help during this period. Now, let’s begin! What is it about? Hibernate Search brings full-text search capabilities to your Hibernate/JPA applications by synchronizing the state of your entities with a search index maintained by Lucene (or Elasticsearch as of Hibernate Search 5.6!). Index synchronization usually happens on the fly as entities are modified, but there may be cases where an entire index needs to be re-built, e.g. when enabling indexing for an existing entity type or after changes have been applied directly to the database, bypassing Hibernate (Search). Hibernate Search provides the mass indexer for this purpose. It was the goal of my GSoC project to develop an alternative using the API for Java batch applications standardized by JSR 352. What do we gain from JSR 352? Implementing the mass indexing functionality using the standardized batching API allows you to use the existing tools of your runtime environment for starting/stopping and monitoring the status of the indexing process. E.g. in WildFly you can use the CLI to do so. Also JSR 352 provides a way to restart specific job runs. This is very useful if re-indexing of an entity type failed mid-way, for instance due to connectivity issues with the database. Once the problem is solved, the batch job will continue where it left off, not processing again those items already processed successfully. As JSR 352 defines common concepts of batch-oriented applications such as item readers, processors and writers, the job architecture and workflow is very easy to follow. In JSR 352, the workflow is written in an XML file (the "job XML"), which is used to specify a job, its steps and directs their execution. So you can understand the process without jumping into the code. <job id="massIndex">
    <step id="beforeChunk" next="produceLuceneDoc">
        <batchlet ref="beforeChunkBatchlet"/>
    </step>

    <step id="produceLuceneDoc" next="afterChunk">
        <chunk checkpoint-policy="custom">
            <reader ref="entityReader"/>
            <processor ref="luceneDocProducer"/>
            <writer ref="luceneDocWriter"/>
            <checkpoint-algorithm ref="checkpointAlgorithm"/>
        </chunk>
        ...
    </step>

    <step id="afterChunk">
        <batchlet ref="afterChunkBatchlet"/>
    </step>
</job> As you see, it brings a pervasive batch-processing workload. Anyone who has experience in ETL processes should have no difficulty to understand our new implementation. Example usages Here are the example usages of the new mass indexer under a draft version. It allows you to add one or multiple class types. If you have more than one root entity to index, then you can use the addRootEntities(Class<?>…​) method. How to use the new MassIndexer long executionId = new MassIndexer()
        .addRootEntity( Company.class )
        .start(); Another example with a more customized configuration: long executionId = new MassIndexer()
        .addRootEntity( Company.class, Employee.class )
        .cacheable( false )
        .checkpointFreq( 1000 )
        .rowsPerPartition( 100000 )
        .maxThreads( 10 )
        .purgeAtStart( true )
        .optimizeAfterPurge( true )
        .optimizeAtEnd( true )
        .start(); Parallelism In order to maximize the performance, we highly recommend you to speed up the mass indexer using parallelism. Parallelism is activated by default. Under the JSR 352 standard, the exact word is "partitioning". The indexing step may run as multiple partitions, one per thread. Each partition has its own partition ID and parameters. If there are more partitions than threads, partitions are considered as a queue to consume: each thread can only run one partition at a time and won’t consume the next partition until the previous one is finished. massIndexer = massIndexer.rowsPerPartition( 500 ); Checkpoints Mass indexer supports checkpoint algorithm. If the job is interrupted for any reason, mass indexer can be restarted from the last checkpoint, stored by the batch runtime. And the entities already indexed won’t be lost, because they are already flushed to the directory provider. Assume that N is the value of checkpoint frequency, then a partition will reach at checkpoint every N items processed inside the partition. You can overwrite it to adapt your business requirements. massIndexer = massIndexer.checkpointFreq( 1000 ); Run For further usage, please check my GitHub repo gsoc-hsearch. If you want to play with it, you can download the code and build it with Maven: $ git clone -b 1.0 git://github.com/mincong-h/gsoc-hsearch.git
$ cd gsoc-hsearch
$ mvn install Current status and next steps Currently, the new implementation accepts different types of entity as entry, provides high level of customization of the job properties and parallel indexation. The job periodically saves its current progress to enable restart from the last point of consistency. Load balancing has been considered to avoid overload of any single thread. This indexing batch job is available under Java SE and Java EE. There are still many things to do, e.g. related to performance improvements, integration into WildFly, monitoring, more fine-grained selection of entities to be re-indexed etc. Here are some of the ideas: Core: partition mapping for composite ID Integration: package the batch job as a WildFly module Integration: start the indexing batch job from FullTextSession and FullTextEntityManager Integration: embed this project into Hibernate Search Monitoring: enhance the basic monitoring, e.g. progress status for restarted job Performance: Ensure a great performance of this implementation These tasks are tracked as GitHub issues, you can check the complete TODO list here. Feedback If you are using Hibernate Search and ever wished for a more standardized approach to mass indexing, this project clearly is for you. We still need to apply some improvements and polishing before integrating it as a module into the Hibernate Search core code base, but any bug reports or comments on the project will be very helpful. So please give it a try and let us know about your feedback. Just drop a comment below or raise an issue on GitHub. Looking forward to hearing from you!

A state renowned for its technological innovation will bring the latest glimpse of our future world order directly into the public eye in Mountain View. Tucked in between San Jose and Palo Alto, Mountain View is part of America’s tech epicenter. It’s also home to Google (GOOGL) – an industry giant that’s quite literally taking its latest innovation to the streets. As we reported on Tuesday this week, Google just announced that 25 of its specially designed prototype driverless cars will be rolling off the test tracks and hitting the open roads. For some, this is the next exciting step en route to a tech-laden driverless future. But for others, despite the fact that safety drivers will be on board and the top speed is capped at 25 mph, the news is sure to stir up controversy. Here’s why… Dear, Humans… Get in the Backseat Google’s goal is simple: Eliminate as many drivers from the roads as possible. Why? Because it wants to “transform mobility for millions of people, whether by reducing the 94% of accidents caused by human error, reclaiming the billions of hours wasted in traffic, or bringing everyday destinations and new opportunities within reach of those who might otherwise be excluded by their inability to drive a car.” Sounds idyllic, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, as I outlined in March, there are three major roadblocks to driverless cars. And the most important one is a biggie… Can we really trust robots to take the wheel? A recent Associated Press investigation will hardly help sway consumer opinion here… Progress… But at What Cost? It revealed that four of Google’s 48 self-driving vehicles licensed to operate on California roads were involved in minor fender benders. Two of those accidents reportedly occurred with the vehicles in self-driving mode. What’s more, the California DMV only started issuing permits for self-driving cars about eight months ago… yet Google’s driverless cars have been on the road for six years. That means the DMV stats mostly likely understate the number of actual accidents. Sure enough, Google responded to the AP report by revealing that its cars have been in 11 total accidents. “Light damage, no injuries,” quipped Google. Seven involved Google’s cars being rear-ended, two involved Google’s cars being sideswiped, and another involved a car traveling through a stop sign. (Details on the 11th accident weren’t provided.) Did you catch the PR spin in there? If not, here it is more blatantly from Google: “Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident.” And that’s the rub here. Google understands that public opinion matters. If people start distrusting the safety of driverless cars, it’ll set development back… commercialization will take longer… and profits will be delayed. So with Google’s self-driving cars hitting the road in earnest this summer, the stage is set for a potential PR nightmare, as the opportunity for more accidents naturally increases. But any backlash over more accidents would be completely unjustified. Let me explain… Putting the Data Into Perspective From a practical perspective, we should expect driving robots to have the advantage over us lowly humans. After all, they don’t try to multitask and use a smartphone like we do. According to the latest National Occupant Protection Use Survey, at any given moment, 660,000 drivers in America are using cellphones while driving. Take a look at this horrifying chart… But driverless cars don’t get distracted by such idle entertainment. And they don’t drive drunk, either, because… well, they can’t! As Singularity Hub’s Jason Dorrier concludes, “They’ll beat us in attention, vision, and spatial awareness every time.” He’s not kidding, either. It’s physically impossible for us to match the specifications of even current generation self-driving cars, never mind future ones. Take Google’s self-driving cars, for instance. They boast “360-degree visibility and 100% attention in all directions at all times.” And embedded sensors can track moving objects (vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians) from “nearly two football fields” away. Nevertheless, accidents are still bound to happen, right? So for arguments’ sake, let’s assume all 11 of Google’s accidents were the cars’ fault. Does that make the risks of advancing the technology too great? Not exactly. Google’s self-driving cars have logged a total of 1.7 million miles, which works out to an accident rate of 0.6 per 100,000 miles driven. That’s pretty darn close to the rate for human drivers of 0.3 accidents per 100,000 miles driven, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. And remember… the self-driving car trend is still in its infancy. Yet the robots’ capabilities are already on par with humans. Over time, driverless car technology will inevitably advance and improve. Accordingly, so will the safety record. Right now, 22% of consumers are already interested in buying a self-driving car, as long as safety and reliability concerns are solved, according to a recent Harris survey. Boosting that number promises to be more of a public relations problem, not a technology one – something that Google is tackling head-on at the moment. So buckle up! And rest assured, we’ll keep you up to date on the latest developments. Ahead of the tape, Louis Basenese P.S. As it stands now, there are only about 70 self-driving cars worldwide. And they’re all prototypes. But experts expect approximately 180,000 driverless cars to be on the road by 2020. Even then, it’ll be a small fraction of the overall auto market, which is expected to sell over 85 million vehicles this year – but make no mistake, this market is growing fast. Louis Basenese helped direct over $1 billion in institutional capital at Morgan Stanley before leaving Wall Street for Silicon Valley. Now, as the world’s premier venture capital analyst, Louis tracks early investment opportunities born from technological breakthroughs and new drug discoveries.

The American driver’s love affair with his/her caris too engrained to surrender complete control to a computer. Also, the transition from driver to driverless will take many years to accomplish because of the investment in current automobile technology. The mix of driver/driverless vehicles on the road will create many unseen problems and will take, at least, a decade or more to resolve. In heavy commute areas, such as Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, NYC, Washington, DC, etc. the driverless car may become popular as its ability to interact with other driverless cars will untangle the commute and greatly reduce the chance of accidents. But that will take a lot of time to develop. Yes, driverless cars will, one day, be the status quo in our nation. But that time is, at least, 20 years into the future.

I like Tec but we are putting to much control into the power of computers these days as we already have them replacing workers and as our Gov even talks about having Robots to replace our soldiers in our military; just imagine if a leader like Hitler would have had a force of robots to keep the people from resisting his dictatorship. I would sure hate for the US to have a leader that was as power hungry as Hitler that would start killing off the Human race at a whim; we have planned parenthood to do that.

How A Teenager Stabbed His Pregnant Girlfriend In Oyo (Photo) Posted August 22, 2016 3:38 pm by admin Comments I GOT INFORMATION ON HOW TO KILL THROUGH GOOGLE, SAYS UNDERGRADUATE WHO STABBED PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND OLUWATOYIN MALIK Ask Google’ is a common refrain when people need answers to issues they cannot solve ordinarily. But a 19-year-old undergraduate, Ade (surname withheld), recently made wrong use of the application when he used it to search on what he could to do to a girlfriend who refused to abort a two-month-old pregnancy she had for him. At the end of his search, he got a knife, went to his girlfriend’s house and stabbed her twice on the stomach and also slashed her throat. The suspect is currently in police net at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Oyo State Police Command, over an alleged murder attempt. Crime Reports learnt that Ade, a 100 level student in one of the universities in the South Western part of Nigeria, allegedly committed the act on Thursday, August 11, at the residence of his girlfriend’s parents at Sango-Alaro area of Ibadan at about 2:30p.m. But for the presence of a policeman, Sergeant Ayeni Oluwafemi, who was the girl’s neighbour and who heard her cry, Crime Reports learnt that the 19-year-old victim would have died in a pool of her blood while his assailant would have escaped. But on rushing to the room where the cry came from, the policeman reportedly met the suspect, holding a knife and about to walk out. He promptly pushed him back, handcuffed his hands and called for assistance to save the girl. Ade, who spoke with Crime Reports, confessed that he acted the way he did because “my girlfriend got pregnant for me.” The teenage also told Crime Reports during an interview that he got the clue on how to resolve the issue of his unwanted pregnancy through the help of Google. According to the young man, “I met my girlfriend about two months ago on Facebook. We had a mutual friend and I added her. She accepted my request and we got to know each other. I proposed a relationship to her and she accepted. We had sex only once on July 4. I did not protect myself. “On August 10, she told me that she was pregnant. The next morning, on Thursday August 11, she called me that her parents wanted to see me. I went to her parents at Alaro area of Ibadan and they wanted to know what my intention was on the pregnancy. I suggested that she had an abortion but they said they could not abort for their daughter because it was against their belief. I told them that I would get back to them on Monday, August 15. “I left for home confused, but on the way home, different thoughts went through my mind because I didn’t want my parents to know. I didn’t want to disappoint them. I was with my phone at home and I picked it and typed “What to do if my girlfriend does not want to have an abortion on Google”. It brought out different options that I can deny, which I didn’t deny. “Another option was to convince her to have an abortion, which did not work. There were also other options but the last one was that I could kill her. I chose that option because she was the only one who knew my house and I believed that if I killed her, no one would be able to trace my house and I would get away with my action. “To kill, Google gave me an option to use poison, which I knew no pharmacy would sell to me. Other options were to use a gun or a knife. Knife was easy to get, so I went to the market same day to buy a knife and returned to her house. I did not meet her at home so I called her and waited for her. When she came in, I attacked her with the knife but she was resisting. I stabbed her on the right and left sides of her stomach and slashed her throat. “Unfortunately for me, her screams got to a neighbour and he came in. Coincidentally, he is a policeman so he handcuffed me and I was arrested. It was the fear of disappointing my parents that made me take the action.” Crime Reports learnt that though the lady survived the attack, she was still in the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital in the South West part of Nigeria where doctors had been battling to keep her alive. Confirming the incident, the police image-maker in Oyo State, Adekunle Ajisebutu, a Superintendent of Police, said that the suspect would be arraigned in court after the conclusion of investigations. http://tribuneonlineng.com/i-got-information-kill-google-says-undergraduate-stabbed-pregnant-girlfriend/ Nairaland What do you think?

 This Google Maps hack makes travel planning easier Anjelica Oswald, INSIDER Aug. 22, 2016, 11:46 AM 2,687 facebook linkedin twitter email print Thanks to Google Maps, I remembered to force my friend to take me to Acorn Street in Boston. Instagram/thisisjelli Sometimes it's hard to keep track of all the places you want to visit — be it a country, a restaurant, or a landmark. But there's one Google Maps hack that makes remembering hotspots infinitely easier: the save feature. Why I love it When I first moved to New York City in October of 2015, it was the first time I was going to be living in a large city for more than a few months. I had mapped out sights I wanted to see and places I wanted to eat while leaving here, but I quickly began to lose track of where I had been and where I still wanted to go. After walking through new neighborhoods in the city, I kept writing down the names of restaurants and shops that I wanted to look up once I got home, but that quickly turned into a mess. Enter Google Maps. The save feature has allowed me to keep track of everything I see or read about that sounds interesting. Now, every time I pass an adorable restaurant, read about an interesting place, or spot a beautiful photo on Instagram, I instantly mark it down on my map. Too many places to visit. Google It's great both locally and for planning trips But the best part about this feature is that it helps me when I plan trips to different cities and countries. I follow a ton of travel bloggers and sites on various social media accounts, so as soon as I read about or see a restaurant or site recommendation, it gets saved. When I recently spent a weekend in Boston, I made sure to visit all of the places I had saved (including the famous Acorn Street) and even added new stars for the next time I head to the city. My saved places extend all over the world.Google How it works First, open your Google Maps app and type in the location of where you want to save. Once it comes up, tap on the tag at the bottom to make the location full screen. After that, all you have to do is click save and the star will be added to your map. It really is that simple. My friend visited this Oregon park, and now I'm looking to make a stop there. Google Maps Even better, if you have Google Maps as your main map app, as soon as you click on an address online or the name of the location on another app like Instagram, it will open it on Google Maps, allowing you to save it instantly. When you're planning a trip to new location or trying to find a restaurant in a city you already live in, all you have to do is open your map, see what you have starred, and make sure you hit it up when you're there. And as soon as you make it to the location you wanted to visit, you can just tap the save button again to unsave it and remove it from your map. Happy saving! Read the original article on INSIDER.

Joseph Sohm / Shutterstock.com This Week in Civic Tech presents a line-up of notable events in the space that connects citizens to government services. Topics cover latest startups, hackathons, open data initiatives and other influencers. Check back each Friday for updates. Google Search takes on voting Google is famous for its ability to bring people to information, but now it’s attempting to bring voters to polling stations. The Mountain View, Calif., company has updated itsrobust search platform with a feature that informs users how and where they can vote in the presidential election on Nov. 8. RELATED What is Civic Tech? This Week in Civic Tech: Civic Engagement Tools for Election Officials, White House Honors Makers This Week in Civic Tech: Chicago Launches Civic Tech Startup 101, U.S. Department of Commerce Data Service Completes Major Projects Web visitors type “vote,” or other types of voting keywords into the search bar, Google will display the tool that provides details based on a user’s geographic location. At a glance, the voting feature is styled much like Google’s quick reference help section. Answers are brief, bulleted, and filled with hyperlinks for additional resources. Key information consists of requirements for in-person or mail-in voting, acceptable forms of identification, voting deadlines and how to register to vote online. All of this guidance is specific to a user’s state, then drills down into specific counties. The only service Google can’t provide directly is information about the polling places since it doesn’t have access to the home addresses of its users. Yet, as an added highlight to the Web app, Google said it will offer nonprofits, academics, journalists and others data from both its “how to vote” app and its “how to register to vote” app — a tool released last July — via a request form. A map depicting voting search interest between 2012 and 2016 notes an increase in all states except Oregon and Kansas, while California, West Virginia, New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Island and Maine boast voting keyword search increases of more than 200 percent. It should be noted that this is not Google’s first venture into voting. In 2012, Google had a Politics & Election site for political news, a live Election Hub to watch party conventions, and an online voter guide to assist citizens. There has also been an experimental program called Google Votes that empowers employees to vote on company decisions based on a system that categorizes issues and allows staff to either vote themselves or award their vote to a fellow voter they consider an expert in the category. San Rafael, Calif.’s, plan for digital transformation This month San Rafael, Calif., has released a beta site along with a new strategy to modernize its digital presence. The Bay Area city just north of San Francisco plans to revitalize its outreach and citizen services with a number of digital upgrades. “We are reimagining the experience our residents, businesses and visitors have with San Rafael,” said City Manager Jim Schutz. “This means a new focus on our digital approach to civic engagement and government operations, especially as more and more of us rely on the Web to communicate and get things done.” With its new site as a starting point, the approach calls for exploration of open data, digital feedback, analytics, transparency and civic engagement. In a release, the city said future digital initiatives might include open financial Web apps and economic development tools for local businesses. San Rafael Senior Management Analyst Rebecca Woodbury, who is spearheading the work, has collaborated with officials to establish a set of values the city will adopt when partnering with vendors and selecting projects. These attributes emphasize transparency, accessibility, “continuous improvement and learning,” in addition to “authentic and responsive [citizen] engagement.” The site, that is in the middle of a beta testing period before it launches early next year, will offer residents a mobile-friendly design, security and privacy features as well as a new content management system for staff. The startup ProudCity has provided the technical skills for the site while the startup Romulus is assisting San Rafael with its customer relationship management system to connect officials with citizens. “We’re excited to approach the future of San Rafael digital from this foundation and quickly expand to other online service offerings,” Woodbury said. There's more to smart cities than apps Using Boston’s honking car horns and congested side streets as a backdrop, Julian Agyeman and Duncan McLaren remind would-be civic innovators that great apps often demand equally great policies. The two co-authored the book Sharing Cities: A Case for Truly Smart and Sustainable Cities, and from their experience, proffered technologists and "intrapreneurial" government types a constructive reality check. (Intrapreneurs are employees within a company assigned to work on a special idea or project, and they are instructed to develop the project like an entrepreneur would, according to Investopedia.) In an article by the Boston Globe, McLaren, an independent researcher, and Agyeman, a professor of Urban and Environmental Policy & Planning at Tufts University, said there are many scenarios where IT innovation just isn’t enough. Often, the two argue, the tech industry’s assumption that ingenuity can outmaneuver politics is flawed thinking. “[This assumption] encourages the belief that there’s always 'an app for that' — that we can address deep-seated, structural urban problems through business-led technological innovation and somehow sidestep the messiness of inclusive politics,” McLaren and Agyeman said. To illustrate their point, they point to “Boston’s perpetual traffic problems” and the city’s partnership with the traffic app Waze. The 2015 Super Bowl in Boston led to a partnership to update drivers and the municipal Traffic Management Center with real-time traffic conditions. While a remedy, the two said real impacts required more. “This may seem like a great idea, and it makes people feel good about a public-private partnership based on information technology,” they said. “But as with much crisis-driven policymaking, it merely represents a Band-Aid slapped over a problem that still requires brave new political thinking and much-needed infrastructure investment.” Jason Shueh  |  former staff writer Jason Shueh is a former staff writer for Government Technology magazine.

Barry Schwartz on August 22, 2016 at 8:46 am More This morning, Google’s Gary Illyes confirmed that the Google Search Console’s Index Status report is broken for the time being. Some are noticing that the report, which shows webmasters how many pages Google has indexed of the site, has not grown in number, as they would expect. Some compared the index status report flat growth to that of the Sitemap report index count. And when the numbers don’t align and shift together, it may be a sign that one of the reports is wrong. It turns out that the index status report is the one that is off and broken. There is no estimated time for this report to be fixed, so for now, rely on your Sitemap index report in the Google Search Console.

SUBSCRIBE The way-too-early AdWords holiday testing guide Looking to run some tests in preparation for the holidays? Columnist Todd Saunders suggests some helpful ideas to get you started. Todd Saunders on August 22, 2016 at 10:57 am More I know, I know, it’s still summer. But before you tell me to get lost, hear me out: Now is the best time to test new strategies, find that perfect audience and lay the tracks for a relaxing holiday. The beginning of Q4 is less than six weeks away, which means you have just enough time to properly test, adjust, optimize and master new AdWords features before you start ramping up for the holidays. According to Google, one out of four shoppers will start their holiday shopping in October. About half will be done with their shopping by the time Cyber Monday and Black Friday even roll around. Big brands are going to try to bully their way to dominating the market, but preparing early will give you a distinct advantage in finding your perfect audience. Let’s walk through best-practice testing methods, then go over four tests you should start running now. Five quick AdWords testing tips Label your ads for testing. At the most basic level, use [Control] and [Test #]. Whatever you need to quickly orient yourself within the dashboard. Don’t overwrite existing ad groups or campaigns with new copy, creatives or structure. Always use a new ad to more easily compare results data. Low budget? Instead of testing small budget evenly throughout the week, put your budget into a single day and spend more time analyzing the results. You’ll reach insights more quickly. Patience. Let the data roll in before you call a winner. Not sure when you have a “winner?” Use this statistical significance calculator to get your answer If you’re testing creatives, manually switch the settings to rotate evenly indefinitely, and pick the winner yourself. I’ve seen Google “pick” an early winner and skew the data by serving it more frequently before significance is reached. Test #1: Device performance adjustments — Eliminate wasted spend, find the best audience People behave differently across devices. According to the Monetate Ecommerce Quarterly Report for Q4 2015 (registration required), conversion rates varied greatly between tablet, smartphone and desktop over the holiday season: Conversion rates by device: Tablet (3.75%), Smartphone (1.5%), Desktop (4.43%) Based on the data above, desktop users were almost three times more likely to buy online than mobile users. That said, the best data is your data. Look for three data points before launching your Q4 campaigns: How your site converts across devices. How your site converted during Q4 in previous years (especially last year). How your ads perform across devices over the next six weeks. If you’re looking to save money this holiday season or wanting to make sure your money is going towards hitting your best audience, pick your best platform and stick with it. Test #2: Expanded text ads — Improve CTR & drive more qualified clicks Google delivered on its promise at the 2016 Google Summit that advertisers will get two headlines for search ads, each supporting 30 characters, and an 80-character description. Standard text ad (left) vs. expanded text ad (right) In their recent digital advertising research report, Merkle found a 16-percent increase in CTR for expanded text ads on desktop for non-branded search. Google’s top two suggestions for testing expanded text ads are perfect for framing your strategy before the holiday traffic spike: Your headlines should receive the majority of your testing attention. Don’t simply add a second headline to existing ads. Rethink your entire ad creative. Provide more value. These clicks are going to be a bit more expensive, based on the amount of page real estate, so it’s important to test this over the next few weeks to find out if there’s actually an improvement in ROI. Test #3: Responsive display ads — Save time & actually reach your target audience You may have seen this pop-up in your AdWords dashboard in the last week or so: These new responsive ads from Google are built dynamically and will automatically resize and adapt based on context. There are five ways to target users on the display network: Interest Based: targeting people based on their interests. In Market Audience: targeting people who are in the market to buy a specific product or service. Topics: showing your ads on websites that talk about specific topics. Keywords: showing your ads on websites that have your keyword on it. Placements: choosing specific websites to show your ads on. All these targeting options are layered on top of one another for increasingly specific targeting. In the past, you might not have been able to reach huge portions of these websites and targeted users if your creative images didn’t match the sizes offered on those websites. Now, with responsive ads, you can reach all those websites and people by providing the following to Google: a short, 25-character headline; a long, 90-character headline; a description of up to 90 characters (This may get cut off with different placements, so shorter is better); an image (recommended size is 1200 x 628); your business name; and a landing page URL. Keep an eye on how your ads perform. Think of this like a broad match keyword: start large, but use your reports to cut wasted spend. Test #4: Price extensions — transparent pricing for highly qualified clicks The more information you can provide up front to your audience, the more qualified the clicks hitting your website will be. Google’s newest ad extension, the price extension, gives the ultimate level of transparency to your product or service: up-front pricing. Before you implement price extensions, head to the Top vs. Other Report to better understand your ad rank, search impression share and average position. Using that information, pick a few campaigns to test price extensions. These are new for you and for all AdWords advertisers, so you’ll want to head to the Ad Extension tab to view the performance of your ads with and without ad extensions. If you’re not seeing a significant boost in ROI, you may be better off with the standard search ad. Get testing! What tests are you running? Will you be changing things up this holiday season?

Amy Gesenhues on August 22, 2016 at 10:35 am More To celebrate the 2016 Rio Olympics, Google created a “Fruity Doodles” free game app and used its home page to share the app via 17 different animated doodles — one for each day of the Olympic games. The animated images, posted on Google’s home pages around the world, pointed users to the “Fruity Doodle” gaming app download page. For the next couple of weeks, we’ll journey to an otherwise unassuming fruit stand in Rio, where produce from all over the market competes for the title of freshest fruit. Google Doodle Blog, August 5, 2016 The app was available on iOS and Android devices during the games, but it is no longer available now that the 2016 Olympic games are complete. In case you missed any of Google’s 2016 Rio Olympic doodles, we put together the full list, starting with the video it posted on day one to demonstrate the “Fruity Doodles” game app. Side note: Day 10’s doodle played double duty with a fatherly watermelon and his two, loving, watermelon kiddos marking Brazil’s “Father Day” holiday.

It’s Instagram, the photo sharing service that took the world by storm a few years ago and was subsequently acquired by the world’s leading social network. Instagram happens to be Facebook’s fourth app to hit this milestone. Previous entries in the three comma club include Facebook’s main app, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. Instagram is certainly joining a distinguished company after achieving this milestone. Bear in mind though that this doesn’t mean that Instagram has one billion users. Estimates suggest that its actual user base is around 500 million but from the looks of it, the download counter does not differentiate between unique installs. Instagram is now the 19th app to achieve this major milestone and becoming one of the very few apps available in the Google Play Store that have been downloaded more than one billion times. Which app do you think is going to enter this exclusive club next, could it be Twitter or Snapchat? Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Apps, Facebook and Instagram.

David Swan The Australian 12:00AM August 23, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX David Swan Reporter @swan_legend The home theatre of the future will be heavy on artificial intelligence and virtual reality and look almost nothing like today’s set-ups, according to futurist Rich Green, the AV whiz behind Steve Jobs’s home entertainment installation. Mr Green, in Sydney for AV expo Integrate, said the technology corporations — Apple, Google, Facebook, Micro­soft and IBM — were plunging billions of dollars into AI and VR, and this would have a profound impact on the way we entertain ourselves in our homes. “The joke going around Silicon Valley right now is if you have any business plan, just add AI or VR and you’ll get venture capital investment. It’s a bit of an exaggeration, but there’s some truth to it,” Mr Green said. “Those two things will define our lives and (Facebook founder Mark) Zuckerberg, who has bought Oculus and folded it into Facebook, believes VR is the end game for virtually all forms of human interaction and communication.” According to Mr Rich, our home theatres in 10 to 15 years will be rooms where all surfaces have 3D active video with head tracking to allow audio to track people wherever they are in the room. “They call them multi modal, must user experiences, and it’s the next way we’ll entertain ourselves in our homes,” he said. “You’ll be floating down the Nile river, like Google’s doing with its ‘expeditions’ project now, or having complete sports immersion thanks to virtual reality cameras on the football field.” Mr Green said he had learned much from Silicon Valley’s technology billionaires, who often sought him out for their own home entertainment systems. “Over the years I ask them, what’s their perspective on their future of technology? And that’s fed into my perspective, from entrepreneurs who have changed the world, and my understanding now is that the next five years are going to look nothing like the last five,” he said. As for Jobs, Mr Green described him warmly as a “fantastic person” with whom he had spent hours discussing high-end audio and the latest products. “He didn’t have a TV in his house, he was all about music,” Mr Green said. “He was about high performance in everything he did; he wanted to push the limits. He had this fantastic audio room in Palo Alto, it was like a church in there, like a ­cathedral.” But Jobs’s set-up was not the most exotic of Mr Green’s career. That goes to a financial manager who wanted a system reminiscent of Tom Cruise’s Hollywood film Minority Report. “He wanted a fully immersive display, and we did it,” he said. “It’s a three-screen immersion room, with 64,000 data points flying in from financial centres around the world. He could say ‘bring me this from CNN in this country’, and that was my first experience of a true dense data immersion experience. And that was in his home, too. It was a precursor to full virtual reality stuff we’re seeing now.” As with any nascent technology, virtual reality will live or die by the availability of good content, and Mr Green says we are already seeing a flood of content in the market, one that will probably only gather in pace. “Through Facebook Mark Zuckerberg has invested in a division of Oculus called Story Studio, and that’s populated with creative designers from Pixar. He’s really picking up top talent and they’re cranking out cinema quality VR stuff,” he said. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

Don't get too worried, though: You won't notice the change. By Brandon Vigliarolo | August 22, 2016, 6:10 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Google Google announced on Friday that it is planning to move away from the app platform on its Chrome browser on all platforms aside from Chromebooks. Starting in late 2016, only those using a Chromebook will be able to download new Chrome apps, though existing apps will still be usable and developers can still release updates.

SEE: Google Chrome security tips for the paranoid at heart (Tech Pro Research) Google is giving plenty of time for developers to migrate their apps to web interfaces, which means they'll load in a browser tab and behave just like any other web page that runs as an app—like Google Docs, Sheets, or Drive. The two types of Chrome apps There are two kinds of Chrome apps: Packaged and hosted. Most of the apps that are used in Chrome are hosted apps, which run in a browser window and act like a website. They can run on any computer that has the Chrome browser installed. The second kind of apps are packaged ones. They run in a separate window and feel more like an independent app, though they are still part of Chrome. According to Google, packaged apps are only used by around 1% of Windows, Mac, and Linux users, but for Chromebook users they're a part of the regular experience. Why it won't really matter Before you start worrying about losing some of your favorite parts of Google Chrome—relax, unless you're part of that 1%. SEE: How to recreate the Chrome Apps Launcher (TechRepublic) What's really going away are packaged apps that run in separate windows. Hosted apps still need to be converted to a web app format, but the transition process is just something for developers to worry about. By 2018, you won't even notice a change, and even those that use packaged apps will probably have them made available as a web app. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Chrome apps are going away for Windows, Mac, and Linux. In their place will be web-hosted apps that run in a browser tab just like any other website. Only 1% of Windows, Mac, and Linux users will be affected by the change, as they're the only ones using packaged Chrome apps that run in a different fashion from a web app. The change will be happening over the next two years and will largely go unnoticed by the average user.

Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print A tech writer for the New York Times has called on Google to hide evidence of Hillary Clinton’s “failing health” in response to New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s comment that “all you gotta do is go online” to learn the truth. Meanwhile, the Drudge Report on Monday highlighted a less-than-flattering image of Clinton with the headline “Excellent Health.” Questions have been raised about her health for years, with reports of fainting, falling, uncontrolled coughing, blood clots, six-month recovery periods and episodes of losing focus. The questions surged during her campaign for the Democratic Party nomination and have only increased since her party’s convention. Among the issues have been her self-described “serious concussion,” her use of special corrective lenses during the Benghazi hearings and her medications. The Clinton campaign hasn’t addressed her health with documentation since 2015 when it released a statement from internist Lisa Bardack concluding she was in good health. Now, Breitbart News reports, New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo wants Google to hide the evidence. “Google should fix this. It shouldn’t give quarter to conspiracy theories,” he wrote. His comment followed a simple challenge from Giuliani, who on “Fox News Sunday” cited her “several signs of illness.” The media “fails to point out several signs of illness by her; all you gotta do is go online,” he said. Host Shannon Bream said there is “no actual evidence” for those claims, Politico reported. “Go online and put down ‘Hillary Clinton illness,’ take a look at the videos yourself,” Giuliani challenged. Only a couple days earlier, the Clinton campaign lashed out at the videos and the images revealing suspect behavior, calling the anomalous actions “deranged conspiracy theories.” Dr. Jane Orient of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons bluntly asked, “Is Hillary Clinton medically unfit to serve?” And a video shows many others are raising similar questions. WND has documented a wide range of concern over Clinton’s health. The “Stop Hillary” campaign is on fire! Join the surging response to this theme: “Clinton for prosecution, not president” GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump recently discussed Clinton’s health in a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity. “She doesn’t really do that much. She’ll give a speech on a teleprompter, and then she’ll disappear,” he said. “I guess she takes a lot of weekends off. She takes a lot of time off. And you know, that’s frankly – frankly, it’s really not fair.” But a Clinton strategist, Joel Benenson, said in the report that Trump must be frustrated. It “must be driving his ego crazy that she’s outworking him, out-thinking him, connecting better with the American voters about the issues that matter in their life,” he said. The reports about Clinton’s health are “ludicrous,” “ridiculous” and “trumped-up,” he claimed. Television doctor Dr. Drew Pinsky was on KABC’s “McIntyre in the Morning” radio show to discuss Clinton’s medical records. He and another physician found reason for “concern.” “Both of us concluded that if we were providing the care she was receiving, we would be ashamed to show up in a doctor’s lounge,” Drew told the show’s hosts. “We would be laughed out. She’s receiving sort of 1950s-level care by our evaluation.” He cited the “bizarre” medications she’s taking for blood clots and hypothyroidism. An award-winning surgeon wrote a commentary that put the concerns about Clinton’s health in perspective. “Imagine, if you would, that tomorrow Donald Trump suffers a concussion. Suppose he trips on a flight of stairs, falling down and hitting his head,” writes Gerard Gianoli, M.D., a member of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons, or AAPS. “The head injury is so severe that he is unconscious for a time and has to be hospitalized for a week. After getting out of the hospital, the Trump campaign tells us that he has fully recovered and that there are no lingering effects of the head trauma. During the following weeks, he is seen in public to wear glasses with a Fresnel lens on one side. He also seems to have trouble maintaining his balance, loses his thoughts in the middle of speeches, and has episodes of spasmodic movements suggestive of seizures.” He continued: “In this imaginary scenario, would it surprise anyone if the media became skeptical and pressed for release of Mr. Trump’s medical records? Would it surprise anyone if the Clinton campaign made an issue of Mr. Trump’s health status during speeches and in TV ads? Would the media cry ‘foul’ over the Clinton campaign doing so? I think the answers to these questions are self-evident. The media and the Clinton campaign would be all over this like white on rice, and no one would question the appropriateness of their actions. “To my knowledge, Mr. Trump has had no such issues with his health. However, Mrs. Clinton has had multiple problems – some she has revealed and some that she has not revealed.” Gianoli, in private practice in Covington, Louisiana, and a faculty member at Tulane University School of Medicine, has pioneered treatments in his specialty areas. He has been granted the American Academy of Otolaryngology’s Honor Award, among others. What do YOU think? Is Hillary physically fit to be president? Sound off in today’s WND poll Orient earlier said there will be no answers until there are complete medical records and an “independent assessment.” A year ago, Clinton’s campaign released a statement of the candidate’s health from Lisa Bardack, M.D., of the Mount Kisco Medical Group. It said Clinton had suffered hypothyroidism, seasonal pollen allergies, deep vein thrombosis in 1998 and in 2009, and an elbow fracture and concussion in 2012. Her medications include Armour Thyroid, antihistamines, Vitamin B12 and Coumadin. But that doesn’t answer the current questions, Orient said. “Is it conceivable that Hillary supporters would really be voting for Huma Abedin, Clinton’s top aide, or for the First First Husband President, Bill Clinton? The American people are entitled to know the objective medical facts about Secretary Clinton,” said Orient in a commentary published by WND. The “Stop Hillary” campaign is on fire! Join the surging response to this theme: “Clinton for prosecution, not president” Gianoli was pointed in asking: “What do we know about Mrs. Clinton’s health? We know that she has suffered two deep vein thromboses and an episode of cerebral venous thrombosis. Blood spontaneously clotting within one’s veins on three separate occasions is not a good thing. In fact, it is life-threatening. This tells us that she has a hypercoagulable state requiring the use of Coumadin (a ‘blood thinner’) for the rest of her life to try to prevent this from happening again. While Coumadin may prevent future blood clots, it can also lead to life-threatening hemorrhage if she has any future trauma.” He added: “We also know that she suffered a concussion and, according to her husband, she took 6 months to recover. How do we know she recovered? If she was a high school athlete, she would have had mandatory neuropsychological testing before being allowed to participate in sports again. Given that being the leader of the free world is more important than playing goalie for the local high school, why is the mainstream media not demanding to see Mrs. Clinton’s post-concussion testing?” He noted her own supporters have talked about her “right transverse venous sinus thrombosis … a blood clot that formed in one of the two major veins that drain blood from the brain.” The symptoms are “headaches, visual problems, and dizziness/balance problems.” “We know that Ms. Clinton has had all three of these. Less commonly known are ‘brain fog,’ problems with concentration, and short-term memory problems. Sounds familiar?” he questioned. A recent Rasmussen poll said 59 percent of voters now believe all major presidential candidates should release at least their most recent medical records to the public. Orient cited the information that has been made available publicly and said it raises many questions. “There’s the photograph of Secretary Clinton’s difficulty walking up some steps. Now inability to climb stairs does not necessarily disqualify a person for public office. However, neither she nor people with her apparently anticipated a problem. The people helping her seem to be preventing a fall. Did she simply trip? Or was it a seizure or a stroke? “Videos widely circulated on the Internet are, if authentic, very concerning. One shows prolonged, inappropriate laughter; another, strange head movements. In a third, she appeared momentarily dazed and confused, and lost her train of thought. Reportedly, she has a volcanic temper. (This is probably not new),” Orient wrote. When blasted by critics for raising questions, Orient was unfazed, telling WND: “Right, I just have questions – and so should all Americans. There will be no answers without complete medical records and an independent assessment – which would include EEG (electroencephalogram): drug levels; evaluation of memory, executive and cognitive function; and an MRI with DTI (diffusion tensor imaging), which can reveal evidence of traumatic brain injury missed on standard MRI.” She continued: “I am not speculating about psychiatric diagnoses. The findings and suggested differential diagnoses are neurologic, and related to risk factors we know she has (concussion and thrombotic problems).” The “Stop Hillary” campaign is on fire! Join the surging response to this theme: “Clinton for prosecution, not president” WND reported earlier on the other evidence cited by Orient. One image shows Clinton getting help to climb stairs. It happened during a February event in South Carolina. There also have been videos that have raised questions. One appears to show her losing her concentration while speaking. She simply comes to a halt and stares at the audience. See the video: And a July 21 video posted on YouTube shows Clinton’s head suddenly turning and shaking vigorously for several seconds. Blogger Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit headlined it, “Wow!” Did Hillary Clinton Just Suffer a Seizure on Camera?” “The poor woman is in worse shape than we thought,” he wrote. Fox News medical “A-Team” also raised questions. Dr. Marc Siegel noted: “In 2008 … I looked over a thousand pages of John McCain’s records because of a melanoma he had 10 years ago. What about Hillary? In 2009, a severe fall. She breaks her elbow. In 2011, she boards a plane, falls. In 2012, she has a severe concussion which Bill Clinton says took her six months to recover from.” He continued: “Then she ends up with a blood clot in the brain and a lifetime of blood thinners. Just that point alone – if she’s prone to falling, you can see from that picture up there that it looked like she can barely get upstairs without two people carrying her. Guess what if she falls and hits her head? She’ll get a blood clot.” And Dr. David Samadi added: “The picture going up the stairs speaks a million words. Is she fatigued? Is she dehydrated? One of the main reasons she fell in 2012 and had the concussions was severe dehydration. They’re holding her and going up the stairs. So she may be really dehydrated, she may have arthritis, she may have back pain, she may have fallen again. We don’t know. There are questions that are unanswered. What we know today is she’s on thyroid medication, she suffers from hypothyroid, low thyroid, that can cause fatigue and gaining weight and all of that.” Siegel said: “I think a traumatic brain injury with symptoms down the road is very, very likely here especially since she had a blood clot on her brain. As David mentioned, that could lead to a seizure problem.” Clinton also has suffered repeated episodes of uncontrolled coughing during her campaigning.   Click here for reuse options!

It will also require your Google Account to provide the Google Assistant service, the AI-based virtual assistant that will intelligently take cues from your conversations to provide results. An annotation feature has also been revealed with which you can write text on photos before you share. Like WhatsApp, Allo will run the files shared through a compression engine making it easier to send them on a low-speed connection. The app will have three sets of stickers pre-installed with the option of downloading more. There will also be voice-messaging, almost exactly like that of WhatsApp's, with a few changes in aesthetics. As a means to set itself apart from the rest of the herd, Allo will have the ability to send self-destructing messages, like that of Snapchat. Messages sent using this feature will vanish from the recipient's inbox after a stipulated amount of time. Google announced Allo along with its video-calling app Duo during I/O 2016. Both these apps are Google's larger plans to have specific apps offering specific services like messaging, video-calling, etc. Both Allo and Duo replaces Google Hangouts which used to be Google's video-calling and messaging app rolled into one.

The Duo is out now while the Allo is still under the works. But a few leaked screenshots show that the Allo, just like Duo, is going to focus on simplicity. Incidentally, it seems to have borrowed a few ideas from WhatsApp, the world's most popular and the one of simplest apps. The idea is that simplicity rules, something that Duo also shows amply. The app was released recently and has been mostly liked by users. However, even as Google copies WhatsApp in Allo, the company is giving it a slicker and cooler looking interface. WhatsApp has never been great when it comes to looks and that is one area where Google hopes to beat the Facebook-owned app with Allo.

When the company realised that its ten years old GTalk was not up to the mark at a time when WhatsApp started gathering users, Google killed it and introduced Hangouts. However, with the growing number of messaging apps in the market, more efficient and expressive, Hangout also could not be of much help to the company. Thus, the Allo and Duo. An Android Police report s hows how Allo and Duo share the same User Interface when using the voice message feature. Both the apps require a button to press when recording any voice message and use of slide option to cancel any voice message. Similar to WhatsApp, Allo too requires user's phone number to activate the app. The two apps share something more than just the looks. Apparently, Allo has the same tech company involved in the development of its feature that worked on WhatsApp. Open Whisper Systems, the same company that worked behind the WhatsApp's encryption feature has revealed in their blog post of their active participation in the development of Allo's incognito's mode.

Incognito Chats in Google Allo Have Snapchat-Like Expiring Messages GO The application also comes with private notifications Aug 22, 2016 12:39 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google announced two exciting applications during Google I/O and last week it released one of them, video-calling app Google Duo. The second, Google Allo should be released soon and the latest information shows that the messaging application will come with lots of useful features. Google Allo is expected to come with end-to-end encryption, as it is using the Signal protocol and private messages will have a tool that allows them to auto-delete, according to Android Police. The information was obtained from a test preview version of Allo and the application is said to come with unique identity keys for each participant. Google Assistant won't work when encryption is activated in Allo. Google will keep incognito chats private and make them easy to identify by using a set of clues. They will have different icons in the conversation list and previews of sent/received messages won't be shown for privacy reasons. In addition, incognito chats will have an expiration time just like in Snapchat. Messages will have an expiration time of 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week or off. These can be changed by either the recipient or sender throughout the conversation. Allo will require users to link their Google accounts for enhanced functionality Recently, information surfaced that Google's Allo will be tied to the user's Google account and to their phone number, the latter being a means of identification. Users will be required to activate the app with their phone number and the app seems to automatically link to their main Google account on the phone. The Google account will be used for allowing Google Assistant to provide users with suggestions, it won't be needed for backups or synched chats. In addition, users will be able to send lots of media content through the app, including voice messages, stickers, current location, photos, videos and GIFs. As far as we can gather, Google's Allo is surely an interesting messaging application that will bring multiple features to Google users and seems to have more tools and integrations with other Google services, compared to Hangouts.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (3 Images) #Google#Allo#Duo#Snapchat#Google Assistant subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google's Allo will have expiring messages (3 Images) 01 02 03 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google’s Allo Lets Users Delete Messages from Chat History Google Duo Becomes the Most Popular Free App in the Play Store Google to Add Audio Calls Support in Duo Facebook Testing End-to-End Encryption on Messenger iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks 3 photos    Incognito mode in Google Allo New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments New Phone Battery Promises to Charge in Seconds, Lasts for More Than a Week more on: smartphone battery i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The app, dubbed Duo, represents Google’s response to other popular video calling options, including Apple’s FaceTime, Microsoft’s Skype and Facebook’s Messenger app. The new app, announced in May, is being released Tuesday as a free service for phones running on Google’s Android operating system as well as Apple’s iPhones. By Alistair Barr Bloomberg  •  Monday August 22, 2016 7:36 AM Google nailed email with the 2004 introduction of Gmail. Now it’s the No. 1 form of electronic correspondence in the U.S. But as traditional email falls out of favor with a growing sliver of the population, Google has struggled to make its messaging tools relevant or introduce new ones that resonate with younger users. Now Google is trying again with a new video chat application called Duo. The app works with mobile devices running Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc.’s iOS. It runs on Wi-Fi and cellular networks, automatically switching between different types and speeds of connection and adjusting video quality. Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call friends, family and other people already stored on smartphone contact lists. The company’s existing video calling and messaging app, Hangouts, requires a Google account, which limited adoption, especially in emerging markets. Face-book Inc.’s WhatsApp and Messenger, Skype — now owned by Microsoft Corp. — and Apple’s FaceTime used phone numbers to grow faster. A confusing array of communication options has held Google back. It has two e-mail services — Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the U.S. based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox; three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts (which offers texting and video calls). This scattershot approach, and Google’s late start, is becoming more costly for the Alphabet Inc. division as messaging evolves from a simple way to communicate quickly into one of the next big technology platforms supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial-intelligence. “Google missed it because of the requirement that you needed a Google ID to communicate with others,” said Ankit Jain, a former Googler and executive at Similar-Web Inc., which measures website and mobile app usage. Hangouts ranked 84th among Android apps in the U.S. in July, based on installs and usage, according to SimilarWeb. That lagged Facebook Messenger, Whats-App and Snapchat. Nick Fox, a 13-year Google veteran, was tasked by Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai 18 months ago with fixing the sprawl. Soon after, his new team formulated a strategy and started building Duo and Allo. “Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that’s through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call.” Fox said in a recent interview. This insight is a decade old and has guided Facebook’s strategy since its creation in 2004. Asian companies, like Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat and Line, have grown into tech powerhouses by connecting people through communication apps and offering related services on top of their networks. Skype, founded in 2003, became a leading video chat app on a similar foundation. So how is Fox going to catch up? Job number one is clearing up the bloated smorgasbord of Google communications services. Hangouts will be a workplace service, offering group video conferencing mostly via desktop computers and office laptops, Fox said. It will be integrated more with Google’s work software, such as Docs, Sheets and Slides, which will be easier to share. Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering. Allo, a messaging service coming out later this year, will also target consumers, Fox said. Google’s Messenger is a basic text system, part of a group of services provided to wireless carriers that work closely with Android. The second tactic: Bringing what Fox says is better technology to the new services to catch up with rivals. Duo constantly performs “bandwidth estimation” to understand how much video can be delivered. If Wi-Fi weakens, it switches to a phone’s cellular network. If a cellular signal drops as low as 2G, Duo will automatically cut video and maintain audio. Allo will use Google’s expertise in AI to automatically understand texts and provide useful suggestions. Google will also let third-party developers create chatbots that will interact with Allo users through messages. That’s already being tried by other companies such as Facebook and Microsoft, but Google has been working hard on AI for about a decade, so it may be more advanced. “First build a great product,” Fox said, repeating a common Google mantra. “Once you get people to love it, they will share it with friends and co-workers and it grows.” Google was late in other technology and caught up, Fox noted. Gmail started in 2004, more than six years after Yahoo Mail, but Google’s offer of mountains of free storage won over hundreds of millions of users. Google’s Chrome emerged in 2008 — over a decade after Microsoft’s Internet Explorer — and is now the most popular web browser partly because of speed and frequent updates. Better technology may not be enough to catch up, Jain said. WhatsApp and Snapchat offered something useful enough to persuade many people to switch away from their existing communication service where all their friends already were. Duo’s promise of video calling for everyone on Android and iOS is something that Hangouts already offers, but that didn’t move the needle enough, he noted. “It’s worth another shot, but having better tech can’t be the only thing,” Jain said.

Your days of woe may be coming to an end, thanks to a new developer update that lets you unlock Chrome OS with nothing more than a PIN. “This will definitely come in handy for touch devices,” wrote Google employee Francois Beaufort in a Google+ post. The experimental feature is being tested in the latest Google Developer update. “All you have to do is enable the flag chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin, restart Chrome, and go to Chrome Material Design settings page for now to set up your Lock Screen PIN in the new ‘Screen Lock’ section,” Beaufort continued. “When it’s done, lock your screen…and enjoy the new experience!” As OMG! Chrome reports, the update comes as part of the most recent Canary Build for the Chrome operating system, and it does away with the pesky task of inputting a potentially long and difficult Google account password every time users try to unlock their computer. Of course, it’s only to unlock a computer — logins and boot ups will still require the entire password. The new PIN option adds a third possibility to the current methodologies, which at present include just the entire Google account password or a paired smartphone. Those wanting to dig deeper should check out the source code here. Seeing as the feature is purely experimental for the time being, there’s still a chance that Google could make a few more tweaks to the system, perhaps making it even easier to use. So if you’re tired of typing in a long alphanumeric password just to get into your Chromebook or Chrome OS, you’re finally looking at a solution.

Google Now features are making their way into Chrome for Android The dev channel's new tab page includes recommended articles and recent bookmarks laid out in the familiar stream of cards. Derek Walter on 19 August, 2016 03:58 0 - - - - print email Google is injecting some of the intelligence from its Google Now service into Chrome. Now when you fire up the new tab page in Chrome dev 54, you’ll see a list of recommended news articles and a section for recent bookmarks. Just as with Google Now, you can scroll down the page and glance at other recommended articles that are based on your browsing or search history and any customizations you’ve made with Google News. If you like your Chrome with a side of Google Now, then you’ll enjoy Google’s latest changes. The feature popped up for me once I updated and launched Chrome Dev. There’s clearly a spot intended to showcase your most recent bookmarks, though that was empty for me even though I had just added a few sites on the desktop. If for some reason you don’t see this, then type chrome://flags into the omnibar. Then look for the item labeled “Show content snippets on the New Tab Page.” Switch this from default to enabled, relaunch Chrome, and you should see the new Google Now feature. While you’re at it, there are plenty of other flags and ways to soup up Chrome. Finally, make sure you have Chrome dev version 54 from the Google Play Store to enable this feature. The impact on you: The dev channel is Google’s more experimental version of Chrome, so these features will likely change before they make it to the stable build. Of course they may also disappear entirely, but that’s the idea behind three different Chrome channels (standard, beta, and dev). You can play around with the latest and greatest in dev or beta, but stick with the stable build when you need reliable browsing.

Get rid of Google Earth Update Helper pop-ups by uninstalling Google’s hidden software updater Large numbers of Mac users report receiving unexpected installation dialogs for Google Earth. Glenn Fleishman (Macworld.com) on 21 August, 2016 10:02 0 - - - - print email If you’re one of the many Mac OS X users who received an installation dialog for Google Earth Update Helper asking you to enter your password, it wasn’t malware. Instead, it seems to be a bad update transmitted through Google’s background software updater—something you probably didn’t even know you had. You can delete the Google Earth plug-in that caused it or remove the software updater entirely. The company’s Mac software installs a background agent, which regularly checks for app updates and pushes them to your computer for Google Earth, Chrome, and other Google software. There’s no front-end to manage software updates, nor does Google provide instructions for removing this background process. The problem wasn’t limited, but occurred worldwide. The Google Earth update was pushed out this way, but users (including this reporter) who entered their password found that the update didn’t take place. (One report indicates that the update pushed to OS X may have been for Windows.) A Google Earth engineer, Viet-Tam Luu, confirmed in its support forum that there was a problem: It appears that a while back we had disabled the auto-updater for the Mac Google Earth Plugin for Safari/Firefox, possibly because of this very issue. Today we inadvertently turned it back on. Oops! Remove the Google Earth plug-in to prevent future update reminders. The engineer said in a later post that the update has been rolled back to prevent it happened again. Luu recommends removing the Google Earth plug-in if you don’t use the software or want to receive updates: In the Finder, select Go > Go To Folder. Copy and paste the following path and press return: /Library/Internet Plug-ins/ Drag the file Google Earth Web Plug-in.plugin to the Trash. Enter a password if prompted. (An account with administrator privileges is required.) However, you may neither want nor need Google’s automatic software updater, even if you’re using Chrome. And some users report removing the plug-in and still receiving the update notifications, so removing the updater may be the only way to reset that state. Here’s how to remove the software updater entirely using a supported feature that Google doesn’t document or provide a graphical interface to use: Launch Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal). Copy the following text exactly as it appears and press return: sudo /Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/ksinstall —nuke Enter your password at the Terminal prompt and press return. (An account with administrator privileges is required.) The Google software update agent and associated files should now be removed. To confirm the files were removed, in the Finder select Go > Go To Folder and paste in /Library/Google/ and press return. There should be no GoogleSoftwareUpdate folder present. You can re-enable the automatic updater via Chrome. If you’re using Chrome, you may need to download updates manually from this point on. In Chrome, enter chrome://help in its Location field, and it will show you whether Chrome is up to date. It also displays a button that says Set Up Automatic Updates for All Users, which restores the update agent.

Mobile first. Mobile only… Whatever approach you take to your m-commerce project, one thing is certain: if you want it to deliver the results you’re expecting, context should be front and centre of your design. Across all industries, mobile traffic is eating into PC web traffic in a big way, even in economies which have a large installed base of consumer PCs. But ecommerce sites aren’t seeing mobile web visitors, particularly those who use smartphones, converting to mobile web shoppers with the same success as PC shoppers. “It is fair to conclude that conversions would be higher if the m-commerce experience on the web was better designed with smartphone users in mind,” writes Andy Favell in ClickZ Intelligence’s new report, ‘The DNA of a Great M-Commerce Site Part 2: The 12 Pillars of Mobile Design’. “M-commerce sites that crack this will sell more.” One of the most consistent mistakes made with mobile site design is a failure to take into account the differing circumstances, needs and intentions of smartphone users; in other words, their unique context. The difference between smartphone and PC users isn’t just a smaller screen size – it’s a whole new set of variables. Google’s guidelines for its search quality evaluators emphasise the importance of taking context into account for mobile users. So how does context impact the way you cater for m-commerce customers, and what can you do to tailor your design to their needs? Why design for context? A customer using a PC to access your website is likely to be doing so in a limited number of settings. Most often they’ll be at home or at work, possibly in an internet café, or using a laptop somewhere like an airport or coffee shop. Even if you imagine that they might be out and about, there are still relatively few plausible scenarios in which they could be logging in, and they don’t differ from one another that wildly. But with mobile, and particularly smartphones, the number of possible scenarios suddenly increases exponentially. Your customer could be travelling, working, moving around the house and multi-tasking, walking to your location, walking to a rival’s location… In each case, the context drastically alters the way in which this customer might be approaching and interacting with your site. Andy Favell explained in a recent article for ClickZ, ‘When will responsive websites respond to user context?’ why cross-platform homogeneity – taking the same approach to design across differing platforms – doesn’t make sense. “Cross platform homogeneity forgets two massive things: The requirements of the desktop and mobile user are often different The requirements of the same mobile user (more importantly) vary depending on whether they are at home, at work, commuting, on route to the location, on site, in a rival’s location and so on. And that’s just the start of it. Now consider: How context varies by time of day, day of week, time of year. What about the trigger that causes the visit to the site e.g. something on TV, snapping QR code in a print ad, tapping through from an email, social media etc.?” Taking a user’s context into account is considered to be a no-brainer for targeted advertising, and the conversions it delivers prove that targeting works. Facebook has achieved great success from advertising thanks to its ability to fine-tune its adverts according to who a user is and what they might be doing. Image by Bablu bit, available via CC BY-SA 4.0 Google is increasingly using the data it collects on users and their search histories to contextualise the results it provides them and make them more relevant. And programmatic advertising is currently making waves with the promise of being able to determine at high speed who to target based on digital cues received about the user. The online world is increasingly trending towards high levels of personalisation as our ability to gather and interpret data about users improves. And for m-commerce, this also seems like the logical next step. As Favell writes in ‘The DNA of a Great M-Commerce Site Part 2’: “If adtech has the ability to target ads on mobile websites at visitors, surely m-commerce sites should use the same types of technology and listen to the same digital signals in order to prioritise the most appropriate content, offers and services, and make the user journey as easy and frictionless as possible?” How to design for context in m-commerce In part two of the ‘DNA of a Great M-Commerce Site’ report, Andy Favell gives a series of tips on how to personalise your mobile offering to users whilst not over-targeting to the point that users find it irritating. He advises: Prioritising content, rather than selecting which content to show to the exclusion of others Suggesting entries in search or form fields, such as postcode or ZIP code in a search box If your website defaults to departments based on previous behaviour – for example, ASOS will open the men’s or women’s store homepage based on what the user has browsed previously – make sure it is clear how to return to the general homepage Facilitating the buying process with options to save for later, save a favourite address, save a favourite meal Encouraging a trust relationship by explaining how personalisation works and how it benefits the user Making it easy to opt in or out of personalisation The epitome of a personalised m-commerce experience is a site that adapts fully to user context, based on signals such as who a person is, where they are, what device they are using, what they like and what they are doing. While there are very few examples of websites who are doing this well at the moment, the concept isn’t too far-fetched. A handful of retailers in the US have already invested in developing native apps which deliver a different experience to the user when they are away from a store versus when they are in-store. The most innovative of these will switch to “Store mode” as the shopper enters a store location, activated by geotechnologies like bluetooth beacons. A number of US retailers have personalised their m-commerce offerings with a dedicated “store mode”, which includes features such as scanning products to check pricing and availability | Image by Intel Free Press, available via CC BY-SA 2.0 DMI’s 2015 ‘In-store Mobile Experiences’ report sets out why a properly personalised in-store mobile experience can be so beneficial to retailers. According to the report, 82% of high-income shoppers said that an improved mobile in-store experience would make the shopping experience better. And 74% of young people aged 18-35 said that they would spend more money at a store that provided an improved in-store mobile experience. Standout performers in the US – which included Walgreens, Home Depot, Nordstrom, Walmart, Target and American Eagle among other brands – offered in-store features such as scanning products to unlock information on pricing and product availability; integrating loyalty programs into the in-store experience; in-store mapping; product recommendations; and reserving a dressing room. These are all location-dependent personalisation features, but there are other mobile signals you can use to divine information about your user’s context and tailor your m-commerce site to them in subtle ways. In ‘The DNA of a Great M-Commerce Site Part 2’, Ronan Cremin, CTO of DeviceAtlas, writes: “Apart from the really obvious one (location) there are other possibilities like detecting if a user is literally on the move or not (accelerometer), is the battery low etc. etc. One important point about all of these contextual cues is to use them as hints rather than hard deciding factors because the cost of getting things wrong based on an incorrect assumption is high. It’s really dangerous to make assumptions about what a user wants, so I think that the best thing to do is make prioritization decisions over ordering of features rather than adding/removing features entirely.” Subtle cues about a user’s state like battery level can be used to personalise your m-commerce site | Image by Martin Abegglen, available via CC BY-SA 2.0 As both Favell and Cremin point out, it’s important not to go overboard with personalisation, as too much can risk alienating the user, especially if wrong assumptions are made. But don’t let this put you off trying altogether. Context is everything in mobile design, and even small adjustments can go a long way towards creating a frictionless user experience and improving your m-commerce sales and conversions.

Why Google plans to stop supporting your Chromebook after five years Google's End of Life Policy sets a schedule for retiring older Chromebooks, but the details are murky. Jared Newman (PC World (US online)) on 22 August, 2016 20:30 0 - - - - print email One of the best things about Chromebooks is that they’re built to last. Thanks to automatic security and feature updates from Google, along with a lightweight browser-based operating system, longtime users may find that their laptops run as well, if not better, than they did on day one. But despite Chromebooks’ theoretical longevity, it’s possible for Google to cut their lives short. Per the company’s End of Life policy, Chromebooks and other Chrome OS devices are only entitled to five years of feature and security updates. After that, Google doesn’t guarantee that these systems will run safely or properly. Obsolescence seems nigh for the first wave of browser-based laptops, including Samsung’s Series 5 and Acer’s AC700, which arrived in 2011. Still, the policy isn’t as cut-and-dry as Google’s Chromebook end-of-life chart makes it seem. Google has left itself some wiggle room to keep updating Chromebooks in the future, and is continuing to update Chromebooks that have officially lost support. Read on for details on how the Chromebook end-of-life policy really works. Chromebook End of Life: What it means for you According to Google, each Chromebook is guaranteed a minimum of five years of updates after the product’s original release date (not to be confused with the time of purchase). Every six weeks during that time, Google provides automatic security and feature updates. Beyond five years, though, things get murky. Right now, two Chromebooks—Samsung’s Series 5 and the CR-48 prototype from 2010—have received an “official” end-of-life date. Another Chromebook, Acer’s AC700, is unofficially slated for obsolescence this month. However, only devices with official end-of-life dates are liable to stop receiving updates. Not that it matters at the moment. A Google spokesperson told PCWorld that the end-of-life date is not a firm cut-off, and that all Chrome OS devices (including Google’s CR-48 and Samsung’s Series 5) are continuing to receive updates. As we said, murky situation. Google’s CR-48, the first Chromebook, was also the first to lose guaranteed support. When will the update situation change? It’s unclear, but users should get a notification on their Chromebooks once the updates stop. At that point, devices may continue to function, but they could become less reliable over time. More importantly, they won’t receive any more security updates, potentially leaving them vulnerable to unpatched exploits. According to the Google spokesperson, the company recommends dumping your old Chromebook and getting a new one at that point. There is, however, one more wrinkle to this story: Given that security is “one of the key tenets of Chrome OS,” Google says it’s “working with our partners to update our policies so that we’re able to extend security patches and updates beyond a device’s EOL date.” Google isn’t making any guarantees at this point, but it sounds like the company wants to extend updates—at least on the security side—beyond five years. It also sounds like device makers such as Acer and Samsung would be partially responsible for making that happen. Why this matters Whether you’re upset or satisfied with Google’s Chromebook support policy depends on your point of view. Compared to a typical PC, Chromebooks are designed to be more secure, thanks to verified boot mechanisms, built-in data encryption, and “sandboxing” that contains threats within apps and webpages. Even in an unpatched state, Chromebooks are somewhat safe. (They’re arguably a lot safer than Android devices, which routinely go unpatched by device makers and are much bigger targets for malware overall.) Still, Chrome OS exploits do happen, and Google itself has noted that the “most effective way to protect against malware is to make sure all software is up to date and has the latest security fixes.” For people with older hardware, those updates may not be guaranteed. Five years may seem like a long time, but Microsoft has typically offered Windows security updates for at least 10 years after an operating system’s release. That’s a big deal given that more than 600 million PCs in use today are more than five years old. For enterprises and schools with slow device replacement cycles, it’s essential. Ultimately, what really matters is that users (and IT managers) can make informed decisions, and that’s the biggest issue here. Google didn’t publish an end-of-life policy for Chromebooks until late 2013, long after the company wooed users with the promise of automatic updates. And right now, the company’s policy page remains ambiguous, so users can’t be sure what to expect. It’s worth noting that end-of-life doesn’t have to mean the end of useful hardware. If you have the know-how, you can install Linux on your Chromebook to extend its lifespan. Otherwise, users whose Chromebooks are still in fine working order just have to hope that end-of-life notification never comes.

Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

By: Tech Desk | Published:August 22, 2016 5:09 pm Google Allo messaging app could launch soon, and leaked photos have revealed some of the upcoming features. Google Allo app could launch soon, and key features of the app have been leaked ahead of the upcoming release. Duo, the video-calling app for one-on-one interactions, has already gone live across the world, and it’s a matter of time before Allo is unveiled. Allo and Duo were first announced at the Google I/O conference in May 2016. With Allo, the search giant is expected to take another stab at mobile messaging, a space where it has lost to players like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Snapchat to name a few. In an interaction with IndianExpress.com, Google’s Product Manager Amit Fulay had said the company is pitching Allo and Duo as more consumer-centric apps, while Hangouts will be viewed as more of an enterprise offering. Allo is the app powered by Google’s new machine-learning assistant called Google Assistant, and will offer more fun features like stickers, the ability to make reservations for a restaurant, share pictures and draw on them, etc. Now AndroidPolice has put out a details on Allo’s features, which includes some pretty NFSW-sticker packs. Other features of Allo being reported by AndroidPolice are the ability to edit photos, share location, share GIFs. However, the app won’t let users share music or documents yet, adds the report. Allo has the edge in GIF sharing over WhatsApp, although Facebook Messenger already supports this feature. Rumours also claim WhatsApp does plan to bring this feature to app as well. Interestingly Allo will also an “annotation feature” where users will be able to draw on photos with different colours, but apparently there are not many personalisations you can do on this drawing bit.

Some of the stickers will be animated, notes AndroidPolice. Google’s Allo will also offer an Incognito mode, where all chats will be end-to-end encrypted by default and messages in these chats will be deleted after a fixed time period, determined by the user. Google’s Allo was criticised by Edward Snowden for not implementing this end-to-end encryption across the app. The search giant has defended its decision, saying the app has features which rely on the Google Assistant and AI, and thus end-to-end encryption won’t be possible if users wish to utilise them. Also read: Google Duo video-calling app review: Simple, works well Allo will also offer “Smart suggestions” or quick short replies that users can send to their friends in Allo. The app will learn more replies over time; the more a user relies on Allo, the better these ‘smart replies’ will get. Google’s machine-learning capabilities mean that Allo can even get an auto-response when someone sends a picture. During the Google I/O demo, the app was able to create conversational responses like ‘Yummy’ for a picture of pasta. Allo will also give suggestions for restaurants and in the US, users will able to book a table at a restaurant inside the app via OpenTable. Google plans to add more such features in the future. Allo’s exact launch date is not yet known. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

Brad Ideas Crazy ideas, inventions and essays from Brad Templeton. Computers, Robocars, Civil Rights, Photography and more. Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40. They are in my queue to write about » reply Don't forget the poaching of Apple's talent Submitted by Mario Herger (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 19:41.

Then the billboards all over highway 101 about the nano-degree in self-driving by Sebastian Thrun's Udacity It's astonishing the tempo that this has taken and accelerating... » reply ... but Apple also picked up an entire company's worth of PhDs Submitted by David Rostcheck (not verified) on Mon, 2016-08-22 08:52. Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22.

Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

However, this is the task in hand for Google's upcoming text messaging service, Allo. Latest leaks have revealed the features that the upcoming messaging app from search giant might bring with its new chat platform. As per screenshots and information received from testers of an early preview of Google Allo, Android Police has compiled a bunch of features we can expect from the Google Allo app. Apart from text chats, Allo will seemingly allow you to share your location, photos, or videos taken from inside application, and also the files taken in your phone's gallery. However, other types of files like music or documents doesn't seem to be possible at present, the report points out.The publication adds that Google's Allo will come with a support for sharing gif images, and also feature an annotation feature that allows you to write anything on the images that you share. No text captions will be possible. This annotation feature will not be applicable to videos. Another important feature to notice about Allo is that just like WhatsApp, size compression for images and videos will also be applied in the Google's text messaging app to make uploads faster. The report noted that the compression appears to be much more aggressive than what Google previously used with Hangouts. The option of playing the video inside application will not be available and you will have to use whichever media player you prefer to watch the videos received within the application. Users will also not be able to trim videos before sending them. There is an option to disable the automatic download of received photos and videos, but no option to limit auto downloads to Wi-Fi only. In a separate report, the publication adds that the messaging app comes with 3 preloaded sticker packs, with the option to download more. For now, 24 additional sticker packs are available from various designers, and the publication notes that for now there seems to be no option to add a sticker pack via a URL or a zip file. As per the report, you can download and arrange the sticker packs as you wish under "My Stickers" category. Some of the options available for download can be termed rather explicit but you will be provided with enough options to say the least, including references to sexting, condoms, and nipples. Some of the stickers also animate. Android Police has further pointed out that the voice messaging feature available inside Allo seems to resemble WhatsApp's voice messaging feature and apart from the aesthetics, works in essentially the same way. Like WhatsApp, Google Allo is tied to your phone number, and based on this can people find and add you. However, it's also linked to your Google account, Android Police points out. Although Allo doesn't necessarily need your Google account to be linked with the app to function, it does need it to make suggestions to you through Google Assistant. In order to understand your personality and learn your behaviour, the app needs to be connected to your Google. The use of a phone number also implies that multi-device support doesn't exist, and that the app tied to the same account on different phones will contain different messages. It is important to note that the account is used in no other way (for syncing data, contacts etc.) apart from learning your personality and you can even have two different Allo accounts tied up to the same Google account, as per the report. In a distinguishing feature from Hangouts, Allo will reportedly provide you the ability to delete sent or received messages. For clarification's sake, the messages will only disappear from your chat history and not from that of sender or receiver of those messages.It should be kept in mind that all of this information has been revealed from a test build of the app and final version might be radically different in terms of features.

Have you heard of the site LMGTFY? It is an acronym for Let Me Google That For You as a sort of dig when folks ask questions of their IT colleagues that they could have used Google for. The somewhat witty (read: passive-aggressive) response is to use LMGTFY to run the query and give that result to the person who asked the question. Since our last post covered how Watson was tackling areas of natural language and much more, we can take the same LMGTFY concept out on the road, literally. How Much Do I Love Thee? Let Me Count the Waze Ok, Shakespeare didn’t pen the phrasing using the Waze name, but what we have come to love is the wildly popular Waze platform. Google Maps is probably the de facto favourite mapping system for many. I know that it’s mine because I’ve been led down the wrong path by a few other mapping systems in the past. Google also opened the door to something else that changed the way we think about navigation by adding traffic to the equation. Google traffic data is fed by the various mobile devices and systems that create inputs showing where traffic patterns are changing in real-time. This gives you the ability to add a traffic layer on top of the existing Google Map system and to use it to derive the duration of your trip. Then, along came a company named Waze. The Waze model uses crowdsourced data such as traffic stops, police checkpoints, accidents, road work, and any other slow down that could be reported via the app and then shared among every Waze user. If You Can’t Beat ‘em, Join ‘em Waze had such a perfect fit with what Google was trying to accomplish that they bought them in 2013 for a reported 1.3 billion dollars. Waze continues to operate today as a subsidiary within the Google universe because they continue to integrate in a very interesting way. This new combined system fed by device inputs (millions of devices), and now by interactive input from the community of users (potentially millions), to make the central system more intelligent. This is where the proverbial rubber hits the road as we strive to reach the next generation of computational engine. Between Watson, and now Waze/Google Maps, we are seeing the trend towards the autonomic era. This is an era of computing that brings vast numbers of inputs into centralized engines and presents the ability to consume the data both via apps and by any number of distributed systems that provide APIs and SDKs to extract usable, intelligent data. Shifting Acceptance of Autonomic Computing  This is also the societal pivot toward a more broad acceptance of the use of real-time systems that deliver decisions that we have had to make ourselves for decades or more. When you think of traffic, we have generations of people around the world who grew up without any electronic assistance to get from A to B. Some of us may still have the map buried in the trunk of a car somewhere. Why? Because we still hold onto that “just in case” feeling of needing a backup. This is a long way that we’ve come from an early distrust of much of these systems altogether. In recent years, the shift towards a truly wide acceptance of systems driven by real-time data has overtaken most of the “just in case” concerns. This is the start of an even more exciting stage in the journey towards autonomic systems. This is where we not only listen to them for advice, but as we will see in the next post, we have even let them take the wheel.

Google’s alternative medal table puts things in perspective Aug 22, 2016 15:08 IST #2016 Olympic Games   #Alternative Olympic Medal Table   #GDP   #Google   #Google Trends   #India   #India's medal tally   #Medal tally   #Olympics 2016   #Rio 2016   #Shareworthy   #When in Rio   By FP Sports When it comes to the 2016 Rio Olympics, Google has been pretty creative. Whether it is live schedules, big data analytics or even fruit games, Google has been upping their game at the Games. So in case you still have the Olympic blues, or you love numbers, or you just want to know how India stands statistically in terms of its GDP, check out this alternative Olympics medal table. “We wanted to take account of factors beyond the traditional medal count. Our data team examined previous Olympics and economic indicators such as the output of a country’s economy (GDP), the size of its population — and also different kinds of search interest on Google (for countries providing data). We then weighted the medal scores by each factor, to create a medal ‘count’ reflecting each variable,” the technology magnate said about this new feature. “The most populous countries and those that invest most heavily in their programs taking the top slots. But what if you could look at the medal table in another way?” the organization added in a blog on Medium. “We wanted to apply the techniques of data journalism to this idea, which is how the Alternative Medal Table interactive was born,” the company added. This fresh take on data journalism really puts the Games into perspective. Also, if you felt India’s official rank of 67 is bad, well then we have some news for you. In terms of population size, India ranks 86 out of a possible 87. If all the world’s populations were equal, India would rank even worse. India ranks better at 65 in ‘Olympic love’, ‘Sports fan’ and ‘Healthy eating’, which calculates search interest in sport participation, searches for sporting activities and search interest in healthy eating. GDP is another area where India doesn’t fare well. Once Gross Domestic Product is taken into account, Indian ranks low at 80. Maybe this table comes as a wake-up call for the officials, who are infamous for their neglect, very infamous.

OpenStreetMap is an open source alternative to Google Maps, Bing Maps and other mapping services. The new OpenStreetView however works different than services like Google StreetView despite the naming similarities. The service uses imagery that users of it are providing instead of capturing street views using company cars in all regions of the world. This means that you won't get a full view of a street, but only image captures. Also, the service does not cover all areas yet which means that you may not get imagery in many areas around the world. That's going to change though when more and more users start to use it and push recorded images while driving to OpenStreetView. The approach has two advantages over comparable services. First, you may get multiple shots of the same area and not just one. Second, and that is related to the first, shots are taking at different dates which means that you get to see an area at different times. Also, the data may be more up to date because of the approach. If Google or Bing want to update the data, they need to get cars to move around in the area again to do so. It happens that street view data is severely out of date because of this. While this may also happen with OpenStreetView data, there is at least a chance that this won't happen if a driver happens to drive around in an area regularly. You can load OpenStreetView in your browser. The map highlights all areas with street imagery in pink, so that you know where imagery is available and where it is not. The coverage of San Francisco is particularly good already, but you will notice imagery in Europe as well already. This is limited to highways and interstates mostly though right now. You may also notice that some imagery is upside down. This is caused by users not paying attention to the position of the smartphone. Mobile apps are provided for Android and iOS that users who want to contribute can use to create imagery and push it to OpenStreetView servers so that they become available to all users of the service. Watch the following video that provides you with additional details about OpenStreetView Closing Words OpenStreetView is an interesting service that crowd-sources street imagery. The approach is the only feasible solution for services that are not backed by companies with multi-billion Dollar budgets. While coverage depends largely on users, OpenStreetView may come to a point eventually where its imagery is superior to competing services thanks to it being fresher. Summary Article Name OpenStreetView launches Description OpenStreetView is a free crowd-sourced service by OpenStreetMap that offers street imagery that users of the service push to it while using it.

New, needs to be polished though. Just had a look for street views for Paris, Champs-Elysées and what was displayed were side streets to the famous avenue, not the avenue itself. But the "Place de la République" (Paris as well) displayed images in accordance with the map. (Yeah, Paris, because I know the place a bit). What needs to be updated on another hand is indeed as noted by the article some (many) Google Street Views, because if it understandable to have 10 year-old images of a small village it remains puzzling to have nothing younger when it comes to JFK Intnl' Airport for instance. It's a good start. Images are small and there isn't panoramic viewing of course. Another approach than that of Google Street View. Complementary.

Reply Tom Hawack August 22, 2016 at 4:06 pm # Implant it on our lovers instead! (so that they don't meet while I'm there, of course) Reply Martin Watson August 25, 2016 at 6:18 pm # That is such a good idea. It will make genealogy so much easier in 100 years. Thank you. Reply Tom Hawack August 25, 2016 at 6:38 pm # I prefer memories to skeletons and even to cryonic preserved meat ... Dave August 22, 2016 at 4:28 pm # Doesn't there need to be an app to pull together: - the photo - the location - the direction the phone is facing - the time of day (so that day and night photos aren't mixed up) No-one am I gonna be adding the phone orientation manually, or sorting through all my photos to find which ones were meant for upload to this service. They need apps before the idea goes cold. After all that, they can think about implementing a photo-transition technology, but they need the data first, while the iron is hot. Reply XenoSilvano August 22, 2016 at 9:42 pm # It would have been nice if this concept could have been integrated directly into openstreetmap.org One of the aspects that I really liked about this initiative is the recognition function that this platform provides, those who contribute to openstreetmap.org know that acquiring on-sight references and then editing those references to the site can be a fun yet painstakingly long process, anything that would make the map editing process more automated would most certainly come as a welcomed relief to contributors. There is an app for iOS titled 'OsmAnd DVR' that offers features similar to the ones in the app shown in the video. Reply Uhtred August 22, 2016 at 9:48 pm # nice idea, I wish them well London had very littl coverage but guess its early days checked site on my netbook (small screen) rather annoyingly the close picture X was almost completely hidden under the zoom controls, they might want to separate those by a few more pixels on the vertical axis Reply XenoSilvano August 22, 2016 at 9:52 pm # @Tom Hawack Someone ###### ##. I think that all photos taken in the boundaries of the road itself should be of imagery facing in the direction of the flow of traffic, anything off the road itself however, I think, should by fair game, I say that because imagery of the storefronts could prove itself useful as well, again, as long as it is not taken from the road itself. Reply Tom Hawack August 22, 2016 at 10:56 pm # If the map shows Road1 as that of the image(s) then the images must show Road1, not Street1, even, IMO, if the image was taken from Street1 There is nevertheless the eternal problematic of the reference : if a picture taken from Area1 shows Area2 must the picture be located as the position of the photographer (Area1) or as the position of what has been pictured (Area2). The GPS approach is of course the location of the photographer, which may be far from was has been photographed, especially with a zoom. If I film the Statue of Liberty from the Empire State Building must I reference the picture Statue of Liberty or Empire State Building? IMO as the Statue of Liberty : we're not investigating a crime we only want a map to show the pictured area. Concerning the Champs-Elysées in Paris the error lets no place for doubt since what we see on the map is the avenue and what we see on the pictures are side streets which could not have been filmed from the avenue, so even a GPS argument is meaningless in this case. ###### ## = really ok (ko?)

By Sarmistha Acharya August 22, 2016 09:48 BST Google to end support for Chrome apps for Windows, Mac and LinuxReuters Google will remove support for Chrome apps on Windows, Mac and Linux over the next two years, the company has said. However, the apps will receive support and maintenance on the Chrome operating system, along with additional enhancements to the apps. Available in two types – packaged and hosted apps – there are about 1% users on the above-mentioned platforms who use Chrome packaged apps, while most of the hosted apps from Chrome are already implemented as web apps. Google, however, encourages developers to continue building apps for the Chrome OS. Google said the new Chrome apps will be only available for Chrome OS users starting late 2016. But users can have access to the existing apps on all platforms, with continuous updates from the developers. During the second half of 2017, Chrome apps on Windows, Mac and Linux will not be available in the Chrome Web Store, although the Store will have extensions and themes. And finally in early 2018, users will not be able to load Chrome apps. Google wants developers to migrate their Chrome apps to the web. The message was heralded by Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, vice president of product management at Chrome, who in the official Chromium blog notes: "As we continue our efforts to simplify Chrome, we believe it's time to begin the evolution away from the Chrome apps platform." Google announced the launch of Chrome apps three years ago. The Chrome app launcher, similar to the launcher on Chromebooks, was first made available for Windows and later on it extended support for Mac OS X and Linux. In March this year, Marc Pawliger, engineering director of Chrome at Google, first revealed plans about retiring the Chrome app launcher as users on Windows, Mac and Linux prefer to launch their apps within Chrome. "With Chrome's continued emphasis on simplicity and streamlining browser features, the launcher will be removed from those platforms. It will remain unchanged on Chrome OS," said Pawliger. Before removing the launcher, users will receive notifications.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas August 22, 2016 09:31 BST Google is testing a new feature that allows users to unlock a Chromebook with a simple PIN code.Google Google is testing a brand new feature to Chrome OS, making it slightly easier for users to unlock their Chromebooks with just a PIN. Until now, users could only safeguard their Chromebook by typing in their Google account password or by using a paired smartphone as authentication to unlock their device. Rather than trying to remember and plug in long, complex passwords, the new experimental feature currently being tested in the latest Chrome OS developer update will allow users to plug in a simple PIN, much like they would do so for a credit or debit card. "This will definitely come handy for touch devices," Google developer François Beaufort wrote in a recent Google+ post detailing how to use the new feature. He also said the "Quick unlock" settings will soon be introduced in the regular Chrome settings page. Here is a simple step-by-step guide to set up the new function to unlock your Chromebook using just a PIN on Chrome OS: Enable the flag - chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin Restart Chrome Head over to the Chrome Material Design settings page to set up your unique PIN for the Lock Screen feature Under the new "Screen Lock" section, set up your unique numeric Lock Screen PIN Finally, lock your screen with [magnifying glass key] + L Try out your new "Quick unlock" feature and unlock the Chrome OS using your new PIN code Many users seem pleased with the new, convenient feature given the fact that plugging in your master "key to the empire" Google account password every time you log in is rather risky, especially in public places. "This is a good move in the right direction," one user commented on the post. "However, I think that this PIN lock feature should be expanded to also include passwords. So the password is not linked to the Google account but a separate password just for the device." The announcement follows Google's decision to gradually phase out Chrome apps on Windows, Mac and Linux over the next two years. "As the capabilities of the web continue to grow, we're excited to see what developers build next," Google VP of product development Rahul Roy-Chowdhury wrote in a blog post. "Alongside other browser vendors, we remain committed to investment in the web and enabling users and developers to benefit from its openness and reach."

As Google and Uber trial prototypes, the future of fully driverless cars and safer roads should come sooner than anyone thought – but they’re in no mood to rush The Self-Driving Lexus that Alex Hern rode in.

In the streets of Mountain View, outside the headquarters of X (once Google X, in the post-Alphabet age it’s moved out of mum and dad’s house and dropped the prefix), I got the chance to do just that. It’s partly unsettling because it’s hard not to feel a flicker of anxiety when you look over and notice that the person driving the car hasn’t got their hands on the wheel, even as you head towards a red light on a corner with a huge truck bearing down on you. It’s partly because the software that drives the car isn’t exactly ready for production yet, so every now and again something weird happens – a jerky overtake, a slight hesitation to squeeze through into an adjacent lane, or, as happened once, the car declaring for no obvious reason that “a slight hiccup” had occurred and that it was going to pull over. And it’s partly because the future has come a lot sooner than anyone really thought. Even if Google takes far longer to start selling cars than it thinks it will (and senior figures in X tell me that they’re confident something will hit the market before 2020), this technology is going to hit the real world somewhere soon, and it’s going to change everything. Uber agrees. The taxi company on Thursday announced the latest phase of its own self-driving tests, putting its prototype cars on the roads of Pittsburgh for real riders to hail them for the first time. They aren’t quite self-driving – they still have a human driver for backup - but they’re the next step for the company’s drive to replace its “driver-partners” (Uber is notoriously reluctant to grant Uber drivers full employment rights) with a fully automated fleet. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid car is test driven in Pittsburgh. Photograph: Jared Wickerham/AP Until a month ago, though, you could be forgiven for thinking the self-driving revolution had already hit. Tesla Motors, the upstart electric car company headed by the charismatic serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched its heavily promoted “autopilot” feature to owners of its Model S cars in October 2015. The feature was labelled a “public beta”, and users were warned to always keep their hands on the steering wheel; but those messages were counteracted by bluster from Musk, who declared in March that year that “We’re now almost able to travel all the way from San Francisco to Seattle without the driver touching any controls at all”. And, of course, the name Autopilot itself does little to suggest to the average user that the car does not, in fact, drive itself. Those mixed messages led to tragedy in May, when a Tesla driver, Joshua Brown, died in a crash which happened while Autopilot was in charge of the car. As Tesla put it, the crash happened when “Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed” a tractor trailer crossing the highway in front of the car; the following day, it emerged that Brown may have been watching a movie as his car drove itself. The problem of semantics But the question of whether or not Brown had been paying attention to the road misses the more important point: he didn’t think he needed to. It’s a point Tesla itself tacitly admitted in China this week, when it changed the name of its Autopilot system from a phrase that loosely translates to “self-driving” to one that more closely resembles “driver assist”. “We want to highlight to non-English speaking consumers that Autopilot is a driver-assist function,” a Tesla spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tesla has highlighted that Autopilot is a ‘driver-assist’ function in the wake of May’s tragedy. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Other car companies have similar technology, but don’t quite sell it in the same way – or with the same bluster. Nissan rolled out its ProPilot technology in Japan this July, for instance, while BMW’s Driver Assistance systems in its 4 series can follow the car in front or warn the driver if they veer out of lane. ProPilot is sold as “autonomous driving” and “intelligent driving”. The semantics of naming are an important consideration for the companies: is their language encouraging drivers to think that their attention no longer needs to be focused on the road ahead? But in X’s experience, modulating the tone of your advertising just isn’t enough. The very existence of almost-but-not-quite-perfect autonomous driving introduces whole new dangers. Nathaniel Fairfield, the principal engineer with X’s self-driving car team who “drove” me round Mountain View, said that people just don’t pay attention to the road, no matter what you tell them. “You can tell them it’s a bundle of self-driving assist systems, but when the sucker drives them for the next three hours just dandy, they rely on their short term experience with it, and if it’s been doing well, they’ll just relax. “You can say whatever you want to say, and people are going to interpret it however they interpret it, and at the end of the day you end up with whatever happens.” X has had its own experience with that fact. In the early days of its self-driving car experiments, it loaned the modified Lexus SUVs which formed the basis of its first cars to employees, to use on their commutes. Even though they had been told to keep focused on the road, and their hands near the wheel – and even though they were in a car owned by their employer, and knew they were being monitored by some of the most all-pervasive telemetry you can put in a vehicle – they still rapidly ended up goofing off in the cars. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Test drivers use a Lexus SUV, built as a self-driving car, to map the area prior to a journey without a driver in control, in Phoenix, Arizona April 5, 2016. Photograph: Reuters To a certain extent, that too can be approached as a simple technology problem. It’s not hard to imagine a driver assist function paired with simple sensors to ensure that the driver’s attention really is focused on the road, just as cars today emit ear-splitting alerts if you try to drive them without wearing your seatbelt. But that’s an engineering problem that Fairfield and the rest of the X team aren’t interested in tackling. “You’re defining success as pissing off a customer enough that they have to perpetually [pay attention],” he said. “People don’t want to do that! People have better things to do with their time in cars these days” than sit and watch the road, and the ultimate goal of the self-driving car project is to let people actually do that.” Andrew Chatham, another principal engineer who had acted as Fairfield’s bug tracker during the ride, jumped in: “I don’t think we’d even claim that it’s impossible to solve this problem, but it’s not the problem that we want to be working on.” Of course, the counterpoint is that it’s still much better to be an irritated driver, being forced to keep your eyes on the road while a driver-assist system ensures that you don’t accidentally rear-end the car in front, than it is to be dead. The technology X has today is capable of feats beyond the wildest dreams of automotive safety technicians even a decade ago: even in my 10-minute jaunt round Mountain View, the car clocked a police cruiser by the lights on its roof, navigated a junction governed only by a stop sign, and carried out a tricky lane-merge in the queue for the lights. Those features could be saving lives today, rather than being held for an indeterminate future. “That’s entirely true,” said Chatham, “and I don’t think we want to call off anyone from what they’re doing. Our intent is not to slag them [off], but the system we have built is aimed at full autonomy, and it is therefore much more complicated than a lot of these other systems. This is not the engineeringly efficient or cost-effective way to build something that just helps you stay in your lane.” Fairfield, though, added a note of caution to the idea that such systems are even a desirable stepping stone. “To be clear, there’s a very complicated calculus: what are people willing to buy? How’s that going to work out? How much safety do you get? How much is that true safety, or how much is that just lulling people into a false sense of security? “Or maybe you’re very clear about it, but how are they going to take that or internalise it or interpret it or how are they going to use it. And there’s a degree of uncertainty, and definitely room for people of good principal to have disagreements.” ‘It’s imperative that a human be behind the wheel’ Other disagreements pose more existential questions for the whole project, though. John Simpson, a US consumer watchdog, has been one of the loudest voices calling on Alphabet to clarify its policy on self-driving cars as a matter of urgency, and particularly to open up about how its system works, and doesn’t work. When one of its test vehicles swiped a bus in February, for instance, the company declined to release the telemetry from inside the car, even as it was otherwise very open about the circumstances of the accident. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google self-driving car collides with public bus Those questions bear down on Alphabet, but are ultimately a call for canny regulators to work with the company in negotiating rules for the new normal. A wild west where self-driving car companies set the rules of engagement – even in response to successful campaigning for openness – isn’t a desirable state of affairs for either the companies, who prefer to operate in a realm of certainty, nor drivers and passengers, who deserve more in the case of accidents than the obfuscatory statements released by Tesla in the wake of its first fatal crash. Simpson is also vehemently against the idea of a fully automatic car, taking the exact opposite stance to X. “It’s imperative that a human be behind the wheel capable of taking control when necessary. Self-driving robot cars simply aren’t ready to safely manage too many routine traffic situations without human intervention,” he said. “What the disengagement reports show is that there are many everyday routine traffic situations with which the self-driving robot cars simply can’t cope.” Which is, in a way, obviously true, and why X’s car remains a research project rather than something you can buy today. The question is how long that will remain true for. “The cars are really, really capable,” says Fairfield, “and the rate at which they’re getting better is actually increasing.” When will it be good enough that they, at least, are happy with it hitting the streets without a fallback? “Not too long.” More features Topics Self-driving cars Google Alphabet Uber Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home election 2016 US world opinion sports soccer tech selected arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home election 2016 US world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech selected arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Technology › Self-driving cars Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Nasa: Arctic ice depletion is "the new normal" Nasa scientists have described ongoing low levels of Arctic sea ice as "the new normal" (Gizmodo). While this year's Arctic sea ice levels aren't likely to set a new record summertime minimum, despite May's record low maximum extent, Nasa sea ice scientist Walt Meier said that "even when it’s likely that we won’t have a record low, the sea ice is not showing any kind of recovery. It’s still in a continued decline over the long term." Meier observed that "a decade ago, this year’s sea ice extent would have set a new record low and by a fair amount. Now, we’re kind of used to these low levels of sea ice," a situation that Nasa and other research organisations will continue monitoring.

Google to retire Chrome Apps from its browser platforms Google has announced that, "starting in late 2016", it's to begin winding down support for Chrome Apps on its Chrome and Chromium browser platforms for Windows, Linux and macOS (CNET). Chrome apps – hybrid web apps that can be launched in Chrome from the desktop – include programs ranging from the secure Signal messenger's desktop app to games such as Little Alchemy, but haven't been widely adopted by most users. As part of Google's project to make Chrome faster and more streamlined, by the "second half of 2017", only ChromeOS users will have access to Chrome Apps, alongside apps from the Google Play Store. 3. Windows 10 Anniversary Update knocks out webcams Microsoft's Windows 10 Anniversary Update rolls out a range of fixes and updates to the popular operating system but unfortunately, one new feature has broken compatibility with a large number of webcams (Ars Technica). The problem is down to the introduction of the new Windows Camera Frame Server, designed to allow multiple applications to have simultaneous access to a webcam. Unfortunately, the Frame Server only supports uncompressed data, while the many USB2 webcams still in use rely on heavy compression to stream video. Microsoft says it'll be adding compressed video support as soon as possible, but until a fix is published, it's possible to disable the Frame Server by manually creating a registry key. 4. Scientists identify Europe's oldest living tree Climate scientists sampling tree growth rings have stumbled upon Europe's oldest inhabitant: a 1,075-year-old Bosnian pine tree in Greece's Pindos Mountains (Motherboard). Unlike most long-lived trees, such as yews and chestnuts, which are clonal – able to asexually reproduce through new shoots that fuse with the tree even after the death of the main trunk – the pine is exactly the same individual that first sprouted over a thousand years ago. The tree's been named Adonis, and expedition leader Paul J. Krusic of Stockholm University in Sweden says that "it is quite remarkable that this large, complex and impressive organism has survived so long in such an inhospitable environment, in a land that has been civilized for over 3,000 years."

Read Nikola Tesla's patent for uncrewed combat drones Drones are a reality of modern combat, but prodigious inventor Nicola Tesla saw them coming in 1889 with his patent for a Method of and apparatus for controlling mechanism of moving vessels or vehicles (Popular Science). Tesla's patent called for drones to be controlled using "waves, impulses, or radiations which are received through the earth, water, or atmosphere by suitable apparatus on the moving body," and he predicted that "by reason of its certain and unlimited destructiveness it will tend to bring about maintain permanent peace among nations". While mutually assured destruction remains a powerful force in global conflict, modern drone warfare is distinctly asymmetrical. 6. Alleged PS4 Slim images appear on Gumtree listing Images of what's claimed to be the "Sony Ps4 Slim Line NEW Not Even In Stores Yet" cropped up in a Manchester-based GumTree ad this weekend (TrustedReviews). Photos recovered before the advert vanished look surprisingly convincing, although it's not clear whether – if genuine – the slim console might be the PS4 Neo, scheduled to be unveiled next month, or a new entry-level model. 7. High testosterone and low cortisol fuel effective teamwork A new study has found that the hormonal makeup of a group can predict how effectively its members will work together to achieve a goal (Ars Technica). Researchers collected saliva samples to analyse the hormone levels of 370 volunteers, who were then randomly assigned to work together in groups of between three and six, which had to carry out a group decision-making task. When their performance was analysed, it was found that groups which had high average levels of testosterone and low average levels of cortisol performed best, regardless of how those levels were distributed among the group's individual members.

Winners included N.K. Jemisin's The Fifth Season in the Best Novel category, a Best Novella award for Nnedi Okorafor's Binti and Naomi Kritzer's Cat Pictures Please for Best Short Story. While attempts at block voting by a small cadre of fans opposed to diversity in speculative fiction caused some minor disruptions, with no award being given in the Best Related Work category, this year's Hugos capture a broad and richly varied view of the current state of the genre. 9. Watch: Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe appears as Mario at Olympics closing ceremony As the Rio Olympics closed, the next host of the games, Japan, was given the opportunity to promote its forthcoming Olympics, four years hence, and did so in unusual style (The Telegraph). In a presentation video packed with anime and gaming references, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe was transformed into Nintendo's iconic Mario and descended into a familiar green pipe to make it to Rio on time. Merging video with reality, Abe himself rose from a pipe at the stadium, still disguised as Mario before the costume fell away to reveal the PM's more familiar sartorial choice of a grey suit, albeit still livened up by Mario's iconic red cap. 10.

Popular on WIRED Infoporn: From Bieber to K-Pop, how fanfic predicts popularity More than half a million stories are uploaded daily to Wattpad; much of it "shipping" (fictional relationships between real people), or "imagines" (a second-person narrative genre that's huge in fanfic), starring celebrities or social-media stars. The numbers are massive: 13bn minutes are spent reading on the platform every month. "According to Comscore, people are spending more minutes on Wattpad than on Candy Crush or Snapchat," says Wattpad co-founder Allen Lau, 47. Its readers are generally young and three-quarters are female, he adds. Founded in Toronto in 2006, Wattpad became vastly popular as fans began reading – and writing – stories on their smartphones. In 2014, Anna Todd's series After – a One Direction fanfic – was picked up by Simon & Schuster and became a New York Times bestseller.

But why does it matter whether Palestinians are on the map? Historian of science Petter Hellström looks at maps of the colonial era for clues Herman Moll’s 1729 map of New England and the adjacent colonies. The map shows few signs of indigenous presence, but a reference to the Iroquois is seen to the far left. Photograph: Wikimedia Petter Hellström Petter Hellström is a PhD candidate at the Department of History of Science and Ideas, Uppsala University.

This, the organisation argued, made the tech giant complicit in Israeli policies of annexation and settlement of the occupied territories. Google responded that they had never labelled Palestine in the first place, while blaming a technical bug for removing the labels for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. While many commentators pointed out the inflated nature of the claim, fewer have engaged with the long-term implications of cartographic omission. Because Palestine, after all, has been removed. It is there on old paper maps, of the Holy Land, of the Roman and Ottoman empires, of the British mandate. Yet in our digital age, a search on Google Maps for Israel produces a map without Palestine. It displays Israeli urban centres down to a few thousand inhabitants, and even marks Ma’ale Adumin, an Israeli settlement on the occupied West Bank. At the same time it shows no Palestinian place-names or urban centres, not even major ones like Gaza City, Khan Yunis or Nablus. The dotted, inconsistent borders of the occupied territories leave the impression that they are not claimed or administered by anyone. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Israel and the Palestinian territories on Google Maps, 19 August 2016. Following strong criticism regarding their omission, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were re-labelled on 19 August. The Golan Heights, between Israel and Syria, remain unlabelled. Photograph: Geographicus/Google Maps While many commentators have pointed out that Palestine is not the only disputed territory in the world, comparisons with Crimea and other disputed regions fall short. Other map controversies are about where borders should be drawn between two sovereign states, yet at stake in the case of Palestine is whether the country and its people exist at all. Israeli nationalists have long denied this – the architects of Israel even rallied under the slogan “a land without a people for a people without a land”. Palestine is presently the only state recognised by the UN not to appear on Google Maps. [See footnote.] Historians of cartography have long studied the practices and consequences of cartographic omission. In a landmark study, “New England cartography and the Native Americans”, published posthumously in 1994, the British historian of cartography J. B. Harley analysed seventeenth-century maps to follow the progressive replacement of the Native Americans with European settlers. In Harley’s analysis, the maps were something more than historical records of that process. Because they made the colonists visible at the expense of the indigenous population, they were also instruments of colonial legitimisation. Many colonial mapmakers preferred to leave the areas of predominantly indigenous presence blank, rather than to reproduce an indigenous geography; one example is Herman Moll’s 1729 map of New England and the adjacent colonies, seen above. The traces of indigenous presence, past and present, were gradually removed from the maps as the colonists pushed west. The apparent emptiness helped to justify the settlers’ sense that they had discovered a virgin territory, promised to them by Providence. The pattern was the same in all areas of colonial activity, including Australia and Africa. Facebook Twitter Pinterest John Smith’s map of New England, drawn in 1614 and later published in London, showing no traces of the indigenous population. Photograph: Wikimedia Incidentally, Harley’s study began as a conference paper entitled “Victims of a map”, a title he borrowed from an anthology of contemporary Palestinian and Lebanese poetry. Discussing the implications of not representing Native American place-names on colonial maps, Harley quoted the Israeli historian and political scientist Meron Benvenisti, deputy mayor and chief planning officer of Jerusalem in 1971­–78, who described the process with which the Israeli state Hebraized the place-names of the country they had conquered: “Like all immigrant societies, we attempted to erase all alien names”, Benvenisti said. “The Hebrew map of Israel constitutes one stratum in my consciousness, underlaid by the stratum of the previous Arab map.” If a map were to represent a territory in all its detail, it would need to be as large as the territory itself, as famously noted by Jorge Luis Borges in his short story “On exactitude in science”. Thus, drawing a map always involves choices, whether they are reflected or not. In the conflict-ridden Middle East, those choices are often blatantly political. The official map of Israel, available on the web page of the Israeli government, integrates the occupied territories into Israel and is devoid of any Palestinian place-names. Conversely, Palestinian maps often label the whole country as Palestine – effectively a refusal to acknowledge the development since 1948. Official map of Israel, integrating the occupied territories and showing no Palestinian place-names, as seen on 18 August 2016. Photograph: Govmap Does this mean we should suspect Google of any political agenda? As the project Disputed Territories demonstrated in 2014, Google Maps shows you different maps of disputed territories depending on which country you are in when you access them. Google, after all, is a commercial actor: they make their billions by pleasing their customers. In the polarised conflict over Palestine, not labelling the occupied territories as either Israeli or Palestinian might well cause the least total amount of indignation. Still it is only one of several possible solutions. If, as others have argued, we mapped political realities rather than conflicting political ideals, Google might have marked Palestine as an occupied territory, rather than as an independent state. Map is not territory, and introducing or removing a name on the map does not invalidate the existence of the thing it refers to: it was European colonists, not their maps, who dispossessed the Native Americans. But everyone who has been to school or who has navigated with a map knows how they direct our attention and shape our experience – and memory – of reality. Immersed in the values and evident truths of their time and place, but also eager to please their readers, mapmakers of the colonial era represented overseas territories from their particular perspective. Trying to stay impartial in the eyes of customers and the surrounding society, the mapmakers at Google similarly represent – and so reproduce – the world as it appears from their culturally encoded point of view. When they chose not to mark Palestine on their maps, they only codified into a cartographic image, how they and their fellow westerners already viewed the world. • Note added 24 August 2016: State of Palestine is recognised by the UN as a non-member State.

The Google Transparency Project campaigns for accountability on the side of Google and has so far been opaque about the funding of the organisation. The web site hosts data sets and updates on meetings between Google executives and official US government representatives. The organisation tracks issues such as undue influence by Google speakers at policy conferences, unethical meetings between the government and Google, or how Eric Schmidt is Obama’s chief corporate ally. The organisers of the Google Transparency Project have been notoriously tight lipped about who they are funded by. Based on an anonymous tip, a Fortune reporter contacted senior Oracle executives, and received confirmation that the anti-Google group was partially funded by Oracle. Microsoft, which has previously funded anti-Google campaigns, has denied any role in funding The Google Transparency Project. The revelation comes close on the heels of Oracle losing an intellectual property rights lawsuit against Google, over the inclusion of Java APIs in the Android distribution. Google anticipated retaliation in many forms after Oracle lost the lawsuit. This sponsorship of a research group that exists only to expose and documents links between Google and the US Government seems to be just such a measure. Clarity on intellectual property rights, and a patenting regime that promotes innovation instead of inhibiting it is the need of the hour when it comes to the messy intellectual property landscape of tech companies. However, another issue here is the shadowy nature of funding of groups that pose as public interest grass root platforms. A large tech corporation is funding a campaign centered around publication of data that reveals the tactics being used by another major tech corporation. In such instances, it is helpful to the consumer, and not misleading, if all the funding information of the campaign is made clear.

Chrome what? “Chrome packaged apps”, dear reader, an effort Google launched back in 2013 and suggested could offer a great way to package apps for multiple operating systems that launched from within Chrome but looked and felt like conventional apps while running. Google's idea was that developers would use Chrome as one target, pop their apps in the Chrome Web Store and then sit back and enjoy the chance to have their apps run on multiple platforms. That idea failed. As the death notice for the format reads, “Today, approximately 1% of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps.” Google also says technology moved on, making it easier to build apps that run in multiple browsers, leaving its packaged apps a bit of an anachronism. Here's what happens next: Starting in late 2016, newly-published Chrome apps will only be available to users on Chrome OS. Existing Chrome apps will remain accessible on all platforms, and developers can continue to update them. In the second half of 2017, the Chrome Web Store will no longer show Chrome apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but will continue to surface extensions and themes. In early 2018, users on these platforms will no longer be able to load Chrome apps. If you developed a packaged app, Google reckons you should port it to the web.

On the Brexit front, financial firms believe the impact of the vote to leave the European Union has not so far been as stark as expected. But the UK housing market is likely to contract next year in the wake of the decision, said estate agents Countrywide. Meanwhile, markets are heading lower and the dollar is climbing again ahead of any interest rate comments from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday. Investors are uncertain about the prospect for rates, given that last week’s dovish Fed minutes were followed by comments from Fed members including Stanley Fischer suggesting a rate rise could yet happen shortly. Oil has come under pressure as hopes fade that OPEC may come up with an agreement to support prices at its meeting next month. In a note today, Morgan Stanley suggested any deal was unlikely. The strength of the dollar is also having an impact on the crude price. And on the deal front, Pfizer is paying $14bn for cancer specialist Medivation. On the markets, the FTSE 100 is currently down 41 points or 0.6%, Germany’s Dax has dropped 0.79% and France’s Cac is 0.4% lower. European markets have seen their declines accelerate as Wall Street opens. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 80 points in early trading. On that note, we’ll close up for the day.

Sean Farrell reports: As Royal Bank of Scotland started charging some clients to hold their cash, its chairman has questioned the effectiveness of ultra-low interest rates and called for a rethink of monetary policy . From Monday, RBS will charge interest to about 70 customers, such as banks and pension funds, on the cash they place with the state-controlled bank as collateral for trading complex financial products. It is the first time a bank has imposed charges for sterling holdings since the BoE halved interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% on 4 August and restarted its quantitative easing (QE) programme of government bond purchases. The BoE relaxed monetary policy in an effort to support the economy following the vote to leave the EU by discouraging banks from hoarding cash. RBS’s chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said that as interest rates get closer to zero the central bank loses control of the effects of monetary policy and leaves itself few options for action iin a recession. Davies told Bloomberg TV: “When you reach the lower band you don’t know how the economy will respond … We don’t really know what impact QE on the scale it is being implemented is having. I really do think we are entering a period where some of the previous certainties are no longer quite so certain and you really need to rethink the monetary policy framework.” The full story is here: RBS starts charging financial customers to park their cash Read more Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.22am EDT 07:22 Back with oil, and Morgan Stanley does not expect any major decisions from next month’s OPEC meeting, despite the market’s earlier optimism that an agreement to support crude prices could emerge. In a new note, the bank’s commodity strategist Adam Longson said: We continue to view a meaningful OPEC production agreement as highly unlikely, but we would not be dismissive of the short term price impact of an OPEC meeting. Comments about intervention alone can scare off shorts. However, we see too many headwinds and logistical challenges to a meaningful deal given past statements by OPEC and its members regarding the positive state of markets, domestic output goals and objections from members producing below potential. In fact, the market has misinterpreted some recent comments from Saudi Arabia, in our view, without seeing the full quote or context. He continued: Oil Minister Al-Falih has said “We are, in Saudi Arabia, watching the market closely, and if there is a need to take any action to help the market rebalance, then we would, of course in cooperation with OPEC and major non- OPEC exporters.” This is the same talking point the kingdom has been using for some time. It neither acknowledges the need for action, nor firmly commits Saudi Arabia to participate if certain parameters are met. We agree with Rapidan Group that it is unlikely Riyadh will take any freeze negotiation seriously as officials believe the market share policy is slowly but surely working. Few OPEC members have expressed a need for a freeze, with the exception of Venezuela. Members with production outages have been less supportive of a production freeze this time as well, with Nigeria now joining the dissent. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al-Falih.

Pfizer has confirmed earlier reports and announced the $14bn takeover of cancer specialist Medivation. Pfizer boss Ian Read said: The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer. The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer’s Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term. This transaction is another example of how we are effectively deploying our capital to generate attractive returns and create shareholder value. This is the latest deal from the acquisitive Pfizer. In April it scrapped plans to merge with Ireland’s Allergan and in 2014 a proposal to buy AstraZeneca for more than £69bn collapsed. But it has since completed the smaller takeovers of Anacor and Hospira.

Rahul R   August 22, 2016 12:25 IST Android 7.0 rollout: Unconventional smartphone rumored to be the first device to run new OS out of the boxReuters Google's Android 7.0 (Nougat) is undoubtedly being anxiously awaited by both loyalists as well as the general users alike across the world. With this being the scenario, it is only natural for Android users to start predicting about which the very first handset running Google's newest operating system out of the box would be. The natural and obvious assumption that comes to mind whenever a new Google Android OS iteration comes to the fore is the Nexus range of devices that are generally amongst the first to run Android OSes straight out of the box. Why advertise with us? However, this time around, the Nexus trend could witness a change as according to a News18 report, the yet to be released LG V20 (rumoured to be releasing later in the year) could initially offer Android 7.0 straight out of the box, then followed by the Nexus smartphone range. This latest report adds substance to earlier reports that hinted about the LG V20 being released with the Android 7.0 operating platform out of the box. At this point in time, the public rollout of Android 7.0 Nougat is yet to be confirmed officially, but is expected by loyalists to seed by the end of August. As far as the key technical specifications of LG V20 are concerned, the smartphone is rumored to feature the below aspects: 5.7-inch display having resolution of 1440 x 2560 Android 7.0 (Nougat) operating system out of the box Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC, along with Adreno 530 GPU 20 MP rear camera 8 MP front snapper 4/6 GB RAM 32/64/128 GB internal storage variants LTE, HSPA, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and microUSB connectivity 4,000 mAh Lithium-Ion battery.

The tech giant is phasing out support for Chrome apps (both packaged and hosted) except for Chrome OS, citing 'less usage' as the primary reason for its decision. The company says that only 1 percent of Windows, Linux, and Mac users are currently using these apps, while most others rely on regular Web apps. In the early days, Google said the Web wasn't advanced enough to provide services like working offline, sending notifications, and connecting to other hardware for transfer of data. For this purpose, these apps had some value. However, with advancements in the open web, all services are now available as regular web apps, making these Chrome apps redundant. For Chrome OS users though, Google insists that supporting these apps is essential as they play a 'critical role.' "There are two types of Chrome apps: packaged apps and hosted apps. Today, approximately 1 percent of users on Windows, Mac, and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular Web apps. We will be removing support for packaged and hosted apps from Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux over the next two years," Google said in a statement.By the end of this year, development of new Chrome apps will only be supported for Chromebooks, and developers won't be able to build apps for Windows, Mac and Linux any more. However, existing apps will continue to thrive, and can be updated as well. Sometime in 2017 second half, the Chrome Web Store will be removed from all the operating systems except for Chrome OS. By 2018, there will be no trace of Chrome apps on these operating systems, and if you have them running on your devices, they will cease to function. Google has instead promised to put more of its efforts into extensions and themes, as they are the new way of enhanced browsing. The company has also promised to give more focus to extensions in the Chrome Web Store.Apart from this, Google has also introduced a new PIN unlock system onto Chrome OS machines for added security. Calling it 'Quick Unlock', Google evangelist Francois Beaufort has announced that the tech giant is testing a new feature in beta that will let users set a pin code, instead of a password. "This experimental feature is currently being tested in the latest Dev update. All you have to do is enable the flag chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin, restart Chrome, and go to Chrome Material Design settings page for now to set up your Lock Screen PIN in the new "Screen Lock" section," he explains. Beaufort has confirmed that this new feature will roll out in the stable version soon, however no specific timeline has been revealed for this.

Advertisement NEXT:Twitter Launches New Notifications Options, Quality Filter PREVIOUS:4 Mistakes Marketers Make With Mobile Facebook Ads Facebook | Google Facebook Ads vs. Google AdWords: Which Is Better for Your Business? By Guest on Aug. 18, 2016 - 4:00 PMComment Facebook’s numerous changes to its algorithm have many marketers scratching their heads. With the social network changing the content users see every few months, every business is scrambling to keep up. Before we talk about paid ads, let’s talk about native reach. Facebook’s stated goal is to please users by showing them what they most want to see. In a June Newsroom post, engineer Lars Backstrom made it pretty clear that Facebook is aware the changes will disrupt businesses. He wrote: Overall, we anticipate that this update may cause reach and referral traffic to decline for some pages. That’s basically saying, “Sorry, but this is going to cause a 42 percent drop in reach.” If that doesn’t make your heart stop, you’re probably not a marketer. Beckstrom went on to explain that you will lose less traffic if your followers share your content, and their followers like and share. So, you get more reach if you generate more reach—got it. Just don’t try to generate reach with clickbait, because that’s another thing on the hit list. To sum it up, every change makes organic (read: free) reach a less viable option. Is it an evil plot to pump up advertising spend? Possibly. Joe Lazauskus, editor in chief at Contently, theorizes that marketers will respond to Facebook’s big algorithm change with more ad spend, which will, in turn drive up the price of ads: As publishers stare at their declining reach, Facebook’s dashboard will offer a helpful suggestion: “Pay $100 to reach 18,000 to 24,000 people with this post.” Over time, they’ll probably have to bite the bullet and open their wallets. Do Facebook’s changes make Google AdWords a more viable advertising spend? To answer that question, we probably need to look at the differences between Facebook ads and Paid Google Search (PPC): Pinpoint targeting: With Facebook ads, you can get extremely specific about the people who see your ads, unlike Google PPC, which based on keywords. A narrowly targeted audience ultimately translates to lower cost per click. Facebook wins this one. Timing: On Google, your ad is search-related, which means that your potential customer is searching for something specific he or she is ready to buy right now. Few people are on Facebook searching for products, so this point goes to Google. On the other hand, Facebook plants a seed that might bear fruit in the future. Local business: Again, advantage Google. If people are looking for somewhere to have dinner or searching for the nearest gas station, chances are they are already in the car on a mobile phone. In 2015, mobile search surpassed desktop searches. Engagement: Facebook wins this point nearly hands-down. While Google generally offers user ratings, on Facebook, brands can interact—answer questions, offer additional information and overcome anticipated objections. There’s not much dissent that brand engagement drives sales and encourages customer loyalty. Ad quality: Facebook wins here, as well. On Google, your ads can’t get much fancier than “bold.” If you really want to go crazy, you can post in ALL CAPS (please don’t). On Facebook, though, you can post graphics, a whole carousel of beautiful photos or a video. So what’s the answer? Well, the definitive answer depends on your business, what you’re selling and the nature of your audience. If you’re offering something with a lot of visual appeal to a well-defined audience, Facebook is a good fit. For local businesses that want to stand out from the competition and grab consumers while they are shopping, Google might be your best bet. Ad-spend wisely, and always track your results.

The company quietly records many of the conversations that people have around its products, reports The Independent. The feature works as a way of letting people search with their voice, and storing those recordings presumably lets Google improve its language recognition tools as well as the results that it gives to people. But it also comes with an easy way of listening to and deleting all of the information that it collects. That’s done through a special page that brings together the information that Google has on you. It’s found by heading to Google’s history page and looking at the long list of recordings. The company has a specific audio page and another for activity on the web, which will show you everywhere Google has a record of you being on the internet. The new portal was introduced in June 2015 and so has been active for the last year – meaning that it is now probably full of various things you have said, which you thought might have been in private. The recordings can function as a kind of diary, reminding you of the various places and situations that you and your phone have been in. But it’s also a reminder of just how much information is collected about you, and how intimate that information can be. You’ll see more if you’ve an Android phone, which can be activated at any time just by saying “OK, Google”. But you may well also have recordings on there whatever devices you’ve interacted with Google using. On the page, you can listen through all of the recordings. You can also see information about how the sound was recorded – whether it was through the Google app or elsewhere – as well as any transcription of what was said if Google has turned it into text successfully. But perhaps the most useful – and least cringe-inducing – reason to visit the page is to delete everything from there, should you so wish. That can be done either by selecting specific recordings or deleting everything in one go. To delete particular files, you can click the check box on the left and then move back to the top of the page and select “delete”. To get rid of everything, you can press the “More” button, select “Delete options” and then “Advanced” and click through. The easiest way to stop Google recording everything is to turn off the virtual assistant and never to use voice search. But that solution also gets at the central problem of much privacy and data use today – doing so cuts off one of the most useful things about having an Android phone or using Google search.   Google voice search records and keeps conversations people have around their phones Independent Online Desk Google could have a record of everything you have said around it for years, and you can listen to it yourself.

Video testimonial from a FMS customer Milligan’s Shower Screens in Forster NSW. As part of the Google AdWords Premier SME Partner program, FMS is handpicked to offer AdWords expertise and experience to small & medium businesses in Australia. Being a Google AdWords Premier SME Partner is a big tick for Fairfax customers, as Premier SME Partners meet Google’s highest standards and criteria for qualification, transparency, and customer service. Guided by this expertise, small and medium businesses can maximise the value and performance of their campaigns.   FMS customer Milligan's Shower Screens in Forster NSW shared their experience. “It’s a great story.

They didn’t have a digital footprint and they were looking to grow their revenue stream.” Joel explains FMS built them a website as well as a whole suite of things. By effectively using Google Adwords, FMS was able to turn the customer’s business around significantly. “Their business grew 30 to 40 per cent. They saw a really strong return for their investment and for them it has been amazing,” Joel said. “I think the quote they use is ‘Christmas came early’.” Joel adds this type of advertising doesn’t necessarily need to be a significant investment. “It’s more that we put you in contact with your perfect customer, matching buyers to sellers.” Contact Fairfax Marketing Services at: Fairfax Marketing Services or phone 1300 123 664 Latest News Jamie Murphy released after Bali police chief confirms drugs test 'negative' Secret video inside Victoria's Riverside Meats Abattoir reveals shocking abuse 'For many years I was embarrassed and ashamed': Labor MP Emma Husar reveals history of domestic violence Labor MP Emma Husar's full speech: 'I am a survivor of family violence' Old public housing to be bulldozed for new homes for family violence victims Editor's Picks Popular Leo Sayer: The vines, the wines and all that jazz . . . one last time Bruce Beresford: Some film stars don’t live in the real world Remember this?

Wednesday 23 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 21:17 / GMT - 17:47 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Sun Aug 21, 2016 1:2 Google Kills Chrome Apps on Windows, Mac & Linux Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Chrome OS has become a low-key success story for Google in the last few years. Because they're relatively cheap and easy to track and manage, Chromebooks has made inroads in businesses and educational institutions. But Chrome OS still has a big shortcoming compared to Windows and macOS: an app gap. To help close that gap and augment Web apps, Google introduced the Chrome apps platform to let developers make Web apps that looked and functioned more like traditional standalone apps. Part of Google's sales pitch was that Chrome apps were universal—without any additional effort from developers, these apps would run not just on Chrome OS, but also any Windows, Mac, or Linux PC with Chrome installed. The Chrome apps platform was an interesting experiment, but it has apparently failed. In a blog post today, Google said that "approximately 1 percent" of all Chrome users on Windows, Mac, and Linux were using Chrome apps. Arguing that Web standards have continued to evolve and become more capable and that the company is simplifying Chrome, Google says that support for Chrome apps on non-Chrome OS platforms will be phased out over the next two years. Extensions and themes will remain available on all platforms. Later this year, any new Chrome apps that are published will only be available to Chrome OS users, though existing apps can continue to be updated. "In the second half of 2017," Windows, Mac, and Linux users won't be able to see Chrome apps in the Chrome Web Store. And "in early 2018," non-Chrome OS platforms will lose the ability to load Chrome apps altogether. The company says that Chrome apps will remain supported and maintained on Chrome OS "for the foreseeable future." Google will even continue to work on and improve the Chrome apps platform for Chrome OS devices. But given that Android apps are coming to Chrome OS and that Chrome apps are being killed on every other platform, their future doesn't look bright.         LATEST STORIES (78) Iran, Indonesia Stress Boosting Cooperation on Human Rights Iran Calls for Collective Efforts to Fight Terrorism UNHCR Official: Iran's Supports for Refugees "Unmatched" US Gives Green Light to Airbus on Sale of over 100 Passenger Planes to Iran Rouhani Felicitates Lebanon on Independence Day Iran, UNIDO Ink Country Program Framework Syrian Commander: Popular Uprising against Terrorists Starts in Eastern Aleppo Battle for Mosul Day 37: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Completes Siege of Tal Afar Israel 'Revives' Eastern Jerusalem Settler Homes Plan Hashd Al-Shaabi Wins Back Several More Villages Near Mosul Libyan Forces Press Forward Against ISIL in Sirte Iranian Speaker: Establishment of Democracy Impossible by Supporting Terrorism in Syria Envoy: Damascus against Proposals to Create Autonomous Areas in Syria Moscow: UN Envoy 'Sabotaging' Syria Resolution ISIL Terrorists Execute 15 Iraqi soldiers in Mosul Iran, Indonesia Stress Boosting Cooperation on Human Rights TEHRAN (FNA)- Iranian and Indonesian officials in a meeting in Tehran on Wednesday underlined the need for the further expansion of mutual cooperation in human rights fields.

Hudly, you say. I had a Hudl, is that the same thing? Not quite. Hudly is a HUD, which stands for head-up display, and it’s the sort of tech that’s been gracing Top Gun fighter jets for years. It eliminates the need to take your eyes off the prize, putting all the important info right in your frame of vision. We’ve seen attempts to create them before – but never this gracefully. So it’s like Google Glass – but on your windscreen? Actually, yes. Like Google’s micro-screen headgear, Hudly’s deft display relies on a visor-mounted projector to send data to a transparent plate of optical glass that sticks to your windscreen. And, just like Google Glass, it uses your phone to deliver the computing power. Will it be all fuzzy, like that time I drew my to-do list on the mirror? It shouldn’t be: the projector is apparently powerful enough to cope with direct sunlight, and the brightness automatically adjusts for the conditions – so you shouldn’t be blinded if there’s a sudden storm. The glass plate is also curved, which is meant to reduce the dreaded glare effect. What can it tell me? If you hook a Hudly up to your motor’s OBD2 slot – something that every car manufactured after 1996 ought to have – then it’ll display all the dirty details right in front of you. Think speed, fuel and all the rest. It’ll also talk to iOS and Android smartphones, so you can keep up with your busy social life (or pester Siri to dial your mates) without the faff of a handsfree kit. Notifications show up just like they would on your mobile, so there’s no new interface to learn, either. Won’t it still be a bit distracting? That’s a matter of preference. In essence, Hudly is just a display – albeit a ruddy good looking one – so it’s only as distracting as what you put on it. Because it runs your smartphone apps, you can stick a sat-nav on it for floating directions straight to your destination. Dedicated HUD software such as Navier will overlay directions on the road, while the manufacturers reckon standard navigation apps will look pretty fly, too. Just don't start Pokémon hunting with it. Go on then, let me try one! Sadly, you can’t. At least, not yet. Hudly is looking for funding on Kickstarter – which could mean that it never gets made. That said, it’s hit 10% of its goal already, so it seems we might not be the only ones who like the idea of augmented reality in the roller. All being well, early backers will be gifted a Hudly by Christmas – just in time for the Boxing Day drive home.

Brad Ideas Crazy ideas, inventions and essays from Brad Templeton. Computers, Robocars, Civil Rights, Photography and more. Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40. They are in my queue to write about » reply Don't forget the poaching of Apple's talent Submitted by Mario Herger (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 19:41. Faraday Future also poached this week a high-profile Apple-engineer on self-driving and computervision: https://electrek.co/2016/08/15/apple-project-titan-loses-self-driving-an... Then the billboards all over highway 101 about the nano-degree in self-driving by Sebastian Thrun's Udacity It's astonishing the tempo that this has taken and accelerating... » reply ... but Apple also picked up an entire company's worth of PhDs Submitted by David Rostcheck (not verified) on Mon, 2016-08-22 08:52. Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker? I heard it here (webinar on high definition maps) http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation/automot... » reply Taxi model Submitted by Bejoy (not verified) on Mon, 2016-09-12 02:45. Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

A typical Chromebook computer comes with two ways to unlock it: you can either pair it with your smartphone and have your mobile device serve as the authentication mechanism for your laptop, or you can type in your Google password. The former is pretty easy if you're an Android user, but less ideal if you use an iPhone, Windows Phone, or another mobile OS (or don't have your Android phone nearby). The latter can be easy too, unless you're being smart about your security and have come up with some crazy-long Google password that's very difficult to remember (and brute-force guess). What is a non-Android user to do? Typically, you'd have to commit some grand violation of account security and write your super-complicated password on a sticky note, as a note on your phone, or as an email to yourself. That, or you'd have to select an easier-to-remember but potentially insecure password. Google is now planning to give users a PIN-based method for unlocking their laptops. While you'll still have to enter your giant password when you start your Chromebook for the first time, you'll at least have an easier time unlocking it after you've closed the lid. A four-digit PIN might be easier to brute-force than a password depending on Google's security mechanisms, but that's assuming a thief can keep your laptop in an "on but locked" state if he or she were to pilfer it. And any thief would have a much harder time guessing your login credentials if the laptop powers off or resets. "This experimental feature is currently being tested in the latest Dev update. All you have to do is enable the flag chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin, restart Chrome, and go to Chrome Material Design settings page for now to set up your Lock Screen PIN in the new 'Screen Lock' section. When it's done, lock your screen with [magnifying glass key] + L and enjoy the new unlock experience," Google evangelist François Beaufort writes in a recent Google+ post. //Related Articles The Best Chromebooks of 2016 "Note that 'Quick unlock' settings will also land in the regular Chrome settings page soon," he added. As OMG! Chrome notes, Google might even consider letting users log into their laptops with a PIN at some point. However, the company still has some security issues to figure out before it goes that route. (Perhaps Google could just force Chromebook owners to use longer PIN passwords, or ensure that each PIN is only associated with a specific Chromebook?)
