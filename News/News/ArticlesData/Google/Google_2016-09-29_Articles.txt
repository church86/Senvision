X Here’s something interesting from Google’s parent company, Alphabet: Its experimental balloon-based initiative to bring internet connectivity to remote parts of the world, called Project Loon, was spotted flying balloons over Yellowstone National Park last week. Here’s a snapshot of a flight map. The red balloon is Loon. Seems Google is testing its LTE loon balloons over Yellowstone National Park, a place usually devoid of connectivity https://t.co/mPT1LUeXuw pic.twitter.com/UJQSHv7ufC— Jason Rabinowitz (@AirlineFlyer) September 23, 2016 Loon is a project of Google’s moonshot division, X, formerly called Google X, now a separate business under the Alphabet umbrella. While Google has been testing these balloons in the U.S. for the past two years — they have a test site in Winnemucca, Nev. — this is one of the rare times they’ve actually been spotted by a human being. Or at least, spotted and tweeted. The balloons generally hover around 55,000-70,000 feet in the air, which is too high to see with a naked eye. They have been spotted as far away as Wichita, Kan., a full 1,377 miles from the test site. Yellowstone is 610 miles north of Winnemucca. Loon shared the story of its 98-day flight over Peru earlier this month. It makes sense that Google wants to get more people online — because if you’re on the internet, you probably use Google. And when people use Google, the company can collect data and serve ads. Internet providers generally won’t lay cables in places where there aren’t enough potential subscribers to make it profitable, keeping a lot of the world offline. As for whether Loon, into which Alphabet has been pumping upward of $1 billion to make work, will be cheaper than building infrastructure in remote areas remains to be seen. If you want to check where Loon balloons are flying right now, take a look at a flight radar map and search for the call sign HBAL.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google launches Keyword to aggregate its many, many corporate blogs Kyle Wiggers Digital TrendsSeptember 30, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google's sprawling web of official corporate blogs just became a little easier to wrangle. The company has launched Keyword, an searchable aggregator of all of its major announcements.More You’re likely aware that Google’s products extend far beyond web searches — the Mountain View, California-based company counts Android, Chrome, YouTube, Street View, and more among its many corporate tendrils. But what you might not know is that almost all of the search giant’s subsidiaries have their own blog, and that those blogs have their own news, updates, and special events sections. Problem is, keeping up with all those streams isn’t easy — short of an RSS reader or mailing list, there isn’t a simple way to keep abreast of the goings-on at Google’s dozens of divisions. But the company intends to change that with Keyword, a new unified, single feed that collates all of Google’s blog content on one convenient page. “Google first began blogging back in 2004 — when mobile phones looked like this and before anyone had dreamed up Chrome, Android, or YouTube,” Google said. “Since then the company has changed a lot, and we’ve published thousands of posts across a large number of blogs. We wanted to make it easier for you to find Google’s official word on any given topic.” Related: As of today, all your Google docs now live in “G Suite” on the “Google Cloud” Google said the overriding mission of Keyword, which officially launched on Thursday, is to “provide a central, official source of news about who we are, what we do, and what we value.” So far, that’s been mostly in the form of aggregation of the company’s 19 most popular blogs. And it’s manifested in filtering and search tools. A Product News filter lets you follow new posts by any of the search giant’s flagship software, services, and hardware (i.e., Android, Maps, Translate, and YouTube, and Topics), and a Topics tool setting allows you to browse by broader category like Arts & Culture, Sports, Travel, and Education. It’s all nifty, thoughtful, and incredibly slick. Keyword’s a little rough around the edges, though. It trolls only a fraction of Google’s blogs — the company has 54 in English alone (Google said it’ll retain blogs not aggregated by Keyword for “more specific audiences”). And it’s limited in scope to the company’s U.S. properties — Google said it plans to expand to include “other languages, countries, and more” over time. Related: Medium? WordPress? Can’t decide? Here are our favorite blogging sites But Google said Keyword is designed to grow. “[It’ll] change as we do, so as we introduce new products and technologies, they can find a home here,” Google said. “It will guide you to the big news of the week while leaving room for smaller, fun updates from that afternoon. And everything comes with bigger, more beautiful images, videos, and slideshows.” Keyward Editor-in-Chief Rose Behar notes that the very first post on Google’s first blog, the Official Google Blog, was published 12 years ago — “before Chrome, before Android, before YouTube.” It doesn’t quite predate Google’s acquisition of Blogger, the modular blogging platform on which the company hosts its many forums, but comes close — the search giant bought Blogger in 2003.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Google, which is hoping to beam the internet to remote areas of the world via balloon, went before the U.N.'s aviation agency to ask member states to let it ply their airspace. The company's X Lab, which was created to pursue big-vision projects, said it hopes to establish a network of helium balloons floating in the stratosphere that will emit a powerful 4G signal to rural and difficult-to-access areas. The new initiative - launched in 2013 and dubbed "Project Loon" - saw its first balloon take off from South America in February only to crash at a tea plantation in Sri Lanka, where it was discovered by villagers. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, had partnered with Sri Lanka to bring the internet to remote areas there. The country's Information and Communication Technology Agency, which coordinated the tests with Google, described the landing as controlled and scheduled. Loon has "significantly improved the balloon design, manufacture and launch procedure," X Lab told the U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Wednesday, according to a document seen by AFP. "The balloons are now robust, remaining aloft well beyond the targeted 100 days, and are launched through a custom developed auto-launcher, allowing rapid multiple launches," X Lab told the organization's executive committee. After compiling publicly available wind data with its own flight data, Project Loon was able to model the stratosphere's air flow, allowing its balloons to "change altitude to 'catch' the winds moving at the speed and direction necessary to a given service area," the document said. Alphabet requested the assistance of ICAO member states as they met for its 39th triennial assembly, asking them in particular to "establish bilateral or multilateral letters of agreement with adjacent states and Project Loon to allow Loon balloons to safely transit flight information region boundaries." Loon is currently working to finalize a safety plan and set up its operations center. In July, leading social network Facebook launched a similar attempt to bring internet access to remote areas via solar drones.

Trump began his speech at the Waukesha, Wisconsin, event by touting an online Google poll that showed him up two points nationwide -- but then followed that by saying Google's search engine was biased in favor of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Google was manipulating search results to suppress negative stories about her, Trump claimed. Trump did not elaborate on the basis for his accusation or indicate whether his campaign had made any formal complaint about the issue. Campaign officials did not respond to our request for further details. Debunked Conspiracy Theory The allegation echoes a conspiracy theory that surfaced after Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination earlier this year. In brief, it accuses Google of meddling with its autocomplete algorithm to prevent negative results from turning up in response to searches of Hillary Clinton's name. However, Google's autocomplete feature is designed to avoid completing name searches with offensive or inappropriate material regardless of who is the subject of the search, explained Tamar Yehoshua, vice president of product management for Google Search, in a post published in response to those charges. Autocompletion is not an exact science, and the output of prediction algorithms depends in part on the popularity and freshness of search terms, Yehoshua wrote. Those making the accusations had suggested there was a conspiracy between the Clinton campaign and Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google parent Alphabet and a supporter of President Obama. A Google spokeperson declined to comment on Trump's Wednesday remark but pointed to the company's earlier denials of bias and its explanation of the autocomplete feature. Clinton campaign officials did not respond to our request to comment for this story. Difficult to Pin Down "Trump's accusation is so vague, it is hard to say just what we are talking about, let alone whether it has any merit," Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, told the E-Commerce Times. It is unlikely that an outside party can predict with any degree of accuracy whether Google's algorithms are biased one way or the other, suggested Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Google's news aggregation service also is based on algorithms, as are a great many online information services. "It's impossible to make a definitive analysis of whether Google's news feed has a bias against Donald Trump," Krewell told the E-Commerce Times, "but Google's news feed is based on an algorithm which likely weighs the relative importance of the sources. The news algorithm, therefore, would favor widely read sources and more reliable sources over smaller, less established niche sites. Facebook Brouhaha A controversy over Facebook's alleged algorithm-tampering erupted earlier this year, following publication of an inside story accusing staff of manipulating its Trending Topics. Human team members were curating the feed, according to the report, downplaying certain information that came from politically conservative outlets. The company conducted an internal investigation and found no systematic effort to manipulate trending topics. However, after sitting down with a group of conservatives, including media pundits and officials, CEO Mark Zuckerberg agreed to make several changes in how it compiled the Trending Topics. For example, Facebook ended the policy of relying on outside websites or news outlets to determine whether stories were worthy of inclusion.

According to him, “8 years from now we’ll be talking about Oct 4, 2016.” That comes in a tweet where he reflects on the fact that 8 years ago, Google announced the very first version of Android. We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) September 24, 2016 So Google thinks this event is going to be a big deal, and with such strong words coming straight from the mouth of Android’s SVP, we’re inclined to believe it. But what is Google planning to announce? We know almost for a fact that they’re planning some consumer-facing “Made by Google” smartphones, but what else could the Mountain View company have up its sleeve for next week?… Pixel and Pixel XL This is the most obvious one, and the one we’ve been hearing about for the longest time. For quite a while it was assumed that Google would be sticking it through with another couple Nexus phones, but it has become clear in recent months that these are an entirely different beast. Rather than being niche prototypical examples of what OEMs should do with Android, the Pixel and Pixel XL are said to be Google’s foremost attempt at building some smartphones of its own — a la Apple or Samsung. But as has been rumored for quite some time, these are being manufactured by HTC. For these, we’re expecting to see either a 5-inch or 5.5-inch AMOLED displays (FHD and QHD, for the Pixel and Pixel XL, respectively), a quad-core 64-bit CPU (likely the Snapdragon 821), 4GB of RAM, a 2770 or 3450mAh battery (Pixel and Pixel XL, respectively), 12 and 8MP cameras (with Sony’s IMX378 sensor, which is basically the 5X/6P’s sensor but with OIS), 32GB of storage, and the usual Bluetooth, fingerprint scanner, NFC, etc. On the software side, we’re expecting these phones to run some version of Android, but it’s clear that Google is making some of its own decisions here to customize the Pixels to be truly unique. For one, they’ll both sport the Pixel launcher (which is basically a modified Google Now Launcher), and the latest word is that the icons — yes, all of the app icons — are going to be rounded. We don’t know much about the software other than that, though, although these will likely launch with Android 7.1 Nougat, its first maintenance release. Google Home Google Home isn’t much of a secret, and that’s because Google showed it off at Google I/O earlier this year. Basically, this is Google’s Amazon Alexa competitor. It’s a Wi-Fi speaker with access to music in the cloud, you can control it with your voice, and it has Google Cast support. It’s a nifty little box, and it has a display on the top with some Google-colored dots that animate to show you it’s working. The big idea here is that Google already has control over lots of TVs by way of Chromecast, and this gives you an always-listening hub to play videos and music through any of those systems. Like the OnHub router, Google wants you to be able to customize the hardware to fit the ambience of your home. Purportedly, you’ll be able to order different bases in a variety of styles and colors. Android Police has recently said that the Google Home will go for $129. Daydream VR headset Also announced back at Google I/O 2016, Google is expected to tell us more about its forthcoming Daydream VR hardware. The Pixel and Pixel XL could be a couple of Daydream-ready devices, but what about that viewer? We heard about it at I/O, but recently we heard that it may be named “Daydream View”. Google is expected, according to the latest rumors, to show the hardware on 10/4. Check out our hands on with an early developer preview version of Daydream. Google WiFi Last week we heard, again from Android Police, that Google is planning yet another router entry for launch next week. This one isn’t an OnHub, though, and will purportedly be called Google WiFi. This product will seemingly be a successor to the OnHub, which has over the last couple of years brought user-friendly WiFi routers made by Google in collaboration with hardware partners. Android Police‘s source claims that the Google WiFi router will similarly have “smart” features, assumably including the aforementioned ability to automatically set up a mesh network — probably similar to Eero. According to Android Police, it’s going to cost $129. Unfortunately, we don’t know exactly what it’s going to look like physically, but AP says it’s a little white box  similar in size to the Amazon Echo Dot. Google Chromecast Ultra This one might just be the least exciting of the group. We first heard that Google would be introducing a 4K-capable version of the Chromecast dubbed “Ultra” last month, and recently Evan Blass dropped an official-looking render of the device. There’s probably not much to talk about here, because besides its higher $69 purported price and support for 4K, I doubt there’s much that’s special about it. Andromeda? As you may know, the big if for Google’s October 4th event is Andromeda, which is what Android Police thinks that Lockheimer is teasing in the above tweet. Supposedly, this is the big Android/Chrome OS merger that has long been rumored and will purportedly bring unity to all of Google’s software offerings — one OS to rule them all if you will. Not long after Android Police posted their little scoop, we got word that Google was testing the forthcoming OS on the Nexus 9, which we discovered evidence of in the AOSP. We later got confirmation that Google has been testing the new OS on the Nexus 9 due to hardware constraints, and that the somewhat-old Nexus tablet won’t be getting the new OS. On Monday morning, Android Police came out again with another leak — this time of a future device that will purportedly run Andromeda. It’s a Pixel laptop/tablet, and we definitely will not be seeing it at the event. What we might see, however, is what we believe may be a Huawei Nexus for developers. Huawei Nexus tablet? This one’s a bit fuzzy, but there’s also a 7″ tablet built by Huawei with 4GB of RAM that we’ve yet to hear anything officially about. We’ve heard that the Nexus brand is sticking around for this tablet, and that it will be able to run some early version of Google’s forthcoming Andromeda OS at some point. Details, however, are pretty scarce on this one and it’s not even certain that we’ll see it on 10/4. Let’s see what happens… We’re excited to learn about everything Google has planned for next week, and both myself and Abner Li are going to be at the event in person to witness what might be one of the most important days for Google in quite some time. Hopefully it will live up the hype, but either way, it’s going to be a great day. If you want to livestream the event, Google already has you covered. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

The latest images try to paint what is probably the best picture yet of what the phones might realistically look like in a natural setting, and they look pretty nice… If you want some more looks at the phone before Google shows it off on stage next week, be sure to check out both the first IRL leak and another from 2 months ago, some more 3D renders from a few weeks ago, another image that leaked showing both phones side-by-side a couple weeks ago, and of course Evan Blass’ first official-looking render from just four days ago. There really hasn’t been any shortage of leaks with these phones. Now, we have yet another artist’s interpretation, and this one might be my favorite one yet. As you can see in the image above (and the few images in the gallery below), the phones look really nice when given some more natural lighting and a realistic background.

(AP Photo) Media rushes to discount claims of Google bias By Rudy Takala (@RudyTakala) • 9/30/16 3:49 PM Rudy Takala Watchdog Reporter The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/Rudy2.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Mainstream media outlets this week moved to discount Donald Trump's allegation that Google manipulated search results to favor Hillary Clinton, and called it a "conspiracy" contrived by the Russian media, ignoring similar reports that appeared in American media and discounting the fact that the researcher behind the claim supports Clinton. The media effort began on Wednesday evening, when Donald Trump cited an opinion survey from Google that showed him leading the presidential race, and alleged that the result was remarkable because Google had manipulated search results to favor Clinton. "The Google poll has us leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide," Trump noted in a speech, "despite the fact that Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton."

Sorry, there was a problem processing your email signup. Please try again later. Processing... Thank you for signing up for Washington Examiner News Alerts. You should receive your first alert soon! The claim infuriated mainstream media outlets. "Donald Trump Pushes Debunked Theory That Google Suppressed Rival's Bad News," said the headline of a New York Times piece published shortly after the event. "Trump peddles Google conspiracy theory," echoed an article by CNN published on Thursday. The issue dates back to a June report by SourceFed alleging manipulation of Google's "autocomplete" feature, which included a video that appeared to show Google trying to prevent users from searching for negative terms associated with Clinton. Democrats were quick to dismiss the report, arguing that Google makes at least some effort to suppress negative content for candidates on both sides of the aisle. Responding to Trump's claim on Wednesday, the Times insisted the issue had been debunked until it was "resurrected" by a Sept. 12 column in Sputnik, noting the outlet is "a website run by the Russian government-controlled news agency Rossiya Segodnya." The author of the report is a Harvard-educated researcher, Dr. Robert Epstein, founder and director emeritus of the Massachusetts-based Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Epstein rebuked the Times for its casual dismissal, noting that he both supports Hillary Clinton and tried to publish his research findings in Politico before taking them to a different outlet. "I wrote a comprehensive article that I originally submitted to Politico," he said. "Politico had me make a number of changes I was uncomfortable with, and ultimately some higher up killed the article. Also from the Washington Examiner Spokesman says Trump wants critics in his Cabinet The GOP spokesman said Trump has a major transition team beginning today. By Kyle Feldscher • 11/18/16 8:32 AM "So I offered it to Sputnik News, but I first made them promise not to change anything to guarantee the accuracy of the report," Epstein said. "They agreed to that. They also promised worldwide coverage, which I thought was a good idea." The column detailed research findings of a nine-person team led by Epstein over the summer, including his claim that Google holds the ability to influence between 800,000 and 3.2 million votes nationwide by manipulating search suggestions. Epstein noted that he has made similar claims through Politico in the past, including in an August 2015 column that made similar estimations about the power Google potentially wields. "I think that the New York Times was irresponsible in dismissing this article without ever looking at it and seeing who wrote it," Epstein said. "They simply dismissed a lengthy, detailed, scientific report, just because it appeared in Sputnik, as if someone on Mr. Putin's staff wrote this." Reports in the Examiner this year have also noted critiques and allegations of Google engaging in politicking. Those include claims of search manipulation, its work with a Democratic law firm to provide election data and the apparent revelation from Clinton's emails that the company worked with the State Department to covertly undermine Syrian President Bashar Assad. Also from the Washington Examiner Reports: Trump picks Rep. Mike Pompeo as his CIA director Pompeo was first elected in 2010 and serves on the House Select Intelligence Committee. By Kyle Feldscher • 11/18/16 8:22 AM Epstein added that in the media's rush to dismiss his claims, it missed a legitimate opportunity to argue Trump was in error. "It's kind of ironic if you think of the timing of the claims. He's claiming right now that Google search suggestions are biased. Right now, actually, they're no longer biased ... A few days after my article came out in Sputnik, Google discontinued its pro-Hillary bias in autocomplete. It discontinued it completely. Now you'll see as many negatives for Hillary Clinton as you do for Donald Trump or anyone else." Epstein said it was Google's power that concerned him more than its potentially brief manipulation in the current election cycle. "I find this new event to be very disturbing, because if Google can turn bias like this on and off as easily as flipping a light switch, that's very troubling to me," he said. "That's more troubling to me than the bias." Epstein said the media may not have discounted him as quickly if reporters had read his work, noting, "I happen to be a Hillary Clinton supporter, which I said in the article." Top Story Trump set to take sharp right turn on immigration policy If personnel is policy, this week in President-elect Trump's transition has been better for immigration hawks than foreign-policy doves.

In 2014, Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk likened artificial intelligence to "summoning the demon." Several months later, Bill Gates expressed concerns about developing "super intelligence." But despite fears of self-aware robots enslaving the human race, work in AI continues apace. Google's DeepMind is using AI to reduce power consumption, car makers like Ford and Toyota are investing in AI for self-driving cars, and the digital personal assistants on your phone grow more powerful by the day. In a bid to perhaps assuage fears and battle misconceptions, six tech titans are joining forces for a new supergroup nonprofit, dubbed the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society. While that name alone might conjure images of a shadowy group of villains plotting your demise in a sky-high tower, Amazon, DeepMind, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft insist their organization just wants to "maximize [the] potential [of AI] and ensure it benefits as many people as possible." Co-chaired by DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and Microsoft Technical Fellow Eric Horvitz, the organization intends to conduct research on and recommend best practices in ethics, transparency, privacy, and collaboration. Academics, nonprofits, and specialists in policy and ethics will also be invited to join the project. "We believe that artificial intelligence technologies hold great promise for raising the quality of people's lives and can be leverages to help humanity address important global challenges such as climate change, food, inequity, health, and education," the project website says. //Related Articles Woz: Get Ready to Be a Robot's Pet As such, the group will combat Terminator-like visions of AI, or as they say, "advance public understanding and awareness of AI and its potential benefits and potential costs." Early partnerships include the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2); additional participants will be announced in the future. One thing likely not on the agenda? Killer robots. In July, Steve Wozniak, alongside professor Stephen Hawking, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, professor Noam Chomsky, and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis warned against the use of autonomous weapons systems.

Another big company that once dominated the globe with its iconic products, bit the dust. Ten years ago, in 2006, no one would have dreamt that the titans of the phone world, Blackberry and Nokia, would become extinct. In today's world of Apple and Google, we can barely register their presence. One reason for the eventual demise of Blackberry and Nokia was the launch of the iPhone in 2007. In one fell swoop, the iconic smartphone made the phone industry look obsolete. Google quickly realized this and re-oriented the course of its Android program. AFP/Getty Images Apple chief executive Steve Jobs unveils a new mobile phone Companies such as Nokia and Blackberry, on the other hand, weren't as agile and kept relying on their strong brands. The strategy was effective for a couple of years, keeping them afloat, and they sold a lot of smartphones. But after 2010, it became harder to convince customers, as these companies had ignored a critical aspect of the smartphone ecosystem -- apps. The phones in the first decade of this century were measured for their hardware prowess and inbuilt capabilities. In 2008, Apple launched the App Store, inviting developers to build applications for iPhones. Similarly, for Android, Google announced its Play Store in 2008 and opened it to developers. These decisions proved to be pivotal to the whole smartphone ecosystem. Going forward, apps expanded the capabilities of the smartphone and created incredible solutions for everyday problems. There were no proper distribution channels for developers to host their apps and earn money by, either putting a price on the apps or by displaying ads in them. But these app stores gave them a great incentive to develop solutions. Nokia stuck to its Symbian OS. It kept developing smartphones based on that platform with enhancements but there was not much incentive and support for developers on the Ovi Store that it had launched. By the end of 2014, the platform was discontinued. The Finnish company continued to experiment with platforms such as Maemo and MeeGo. On the other hand, Blackberry was still selling a healthy number of phones built with its BlackBerryOS. It even tried to bring Android apps to its BB10 platform. But the OS released in 2013 couldn't catch up with Android and iOS. Meanwhile, in 2011, Nokia entered into a strategic partnership with Microsoft to produce phones based on the Windows 7 platform. But users of the platform dipped in the first few years of usage. In 2014, Microsoft completed the acquisition of Nokia for $7.2 billion and started producing phones themselves. The company had high hopes for the Lumia line of phones, along with the phones produced by its partners. But customers didn't quite respond, even after the company introduced the new Windows 10 mobile platform for all the devices. It also unsuccessfully tried to import iOS and Android apps to the platform, but the lack of apps such as Snapchat always made customers wary of buying a Windows phone. According to a recent report, in the last quarter, the number of Windows phones shipped made up less than 1 percent of the world's phone shipment. It is highly possible that Microsoft is going to kill the Lumia series of phones by the end of this year. It is still trying to keep the Windows Mobile platform afloat, possibly launching a Surface phone next year. Other platforms, such as Samsung's Tizen, are skating on thin ice too and are on the verge of extinction because of the lack of an app ecosystem. For any new operating system to thrive, it simply has to tackle the app problem in an innovative manner.

Security robots. Customers feeling shaken by recent attacks at U.S. malls may not notice huge changes — but mall operators are testing and putting in place new technologies and other measures to offer people more protection without intruding too much on their shopping time. Mall executives say shoppers have been adamantly opposed to airport security tactics like metal detectors. So they're trying other things, and increasingly using mass notifications that let them send text and email alerts to tenants within seconds in case of a crisis. ___ A year of Alphabet: Great for Google, less so for moonshots SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Reorganizing itself under the umbrella company Alphabet has done wonders for Google — but less so for a grab bag of eclectic projects ranging from robotic cars to internet-beaming balloons, which are suffering costly growing pains. A year after Alphabet took shape, Google's revenue growth has accelerated — an unusual development for a company of its size. That success, however, also underscores Alphabet's dependence on the fickle business of placing digital ads in core Google products like search, Gmail and YouTube video. As a result, it remains vulnerable to swings in marketing budgets and stiffening competition from another equally ambitious rival, Facebook. ___ Stocks say 'never mind'; reverse recent losses as banks jump NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks climbed Friday as banks made a rapid recovery following a steep fall a day ago. Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. ___ Q&A: Will Deutsche Bank become the next Lehman Germany's biggest bank is looking shaky and some investors fear it could collapse and endanger the wider financial system. Some even wonder whether it might become the next Lehman Brothers, the U.S. bank whose failure unleashed the worst of the global financial crisis in 2008. Experts warn against drawing such quick conclusions. Deutsche Bank's shares are down 51 percent so far this year and it's negotiating a multibillion-dollar fine in the U.S. that it could have trouble paying. But it's exactly because it is so big and important that it is unlikely to be allowed to simply fail, the way U.S. authorities did with Lehman. Here are some questions and answers about the bank and what it might mean for the rest of the world. ___ US consumer spending at weakest pace in 5 months WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. consumers scaled back their spending in August to its weakest pace in five months, reflecting a drop in spending on autos. Income growth also decelerated as wages and salary gains slowed following four strong months. Consumer spending was unchanged last month after solid gains of 0.4 percent in July and 0.3 percent in June, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the poorest showing since a similar flat reading in March. ___ From Ferraris to SUVs: 5 cars that shone at the Paris show PARIS (AP) -- An obscenely powerful hybrid sports car, a family-friendly SUV with enough space for seven adults, and an electric vehicle that promises to keep going for over 300 miles (500 kilometers) on a single charge — these are some of the notable vehicles shining on the display stands under bright overhead lights at the Paris auto show. Executives at this year's show are talking about how the industry can adapt to — or, better yet, profit from — disruptive change such as electric engines, networked vehicles, car sharing, and autonomous driving. All that could start coming together between 2020 and 2025, some think. Read More Right now, however, they have some cars they want to sell. Here are five of the vehicles getting the most attention at the Paris Mondial de L'Automobile, which opens to the public Saturday and runs through Oct. 16. If you are lucky enough to be in the City of Light, an adult ticket costs 16 euros ($17.90). ___ US closes probe of Jeep automatic braking; no recall sought DETROIT (AP) -- U.S. safety regulators have closed a yearlong investigation into the Jeep Grand Cherokee's automatic braking system without seeking a recall. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began the probe in June of last year after getting complaints that the system braked for no reason, increasing the risk of rear-end crashes. ___ BMW issues recall for new Takata air bag problem DETROIT (AP) -- Another potentially deadly problem has surfaced with Takata air bags, this one forcing BMW to recall over 4,000 SUVs in the U.S. and Canada. The new problem was traced to improper welds, and it's separate from the trouble that has caused the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. ___ Subaru recalls about 593K cars; wiper motors can overheat DETROIT (AP) -- Subaru is recalling nearly 593,000 vehicles, some for a second time, because windshield wiper motors can overheat and increase the risk of a fire. The recall affects certain Legacy and Outback cars from the 2010 to 2014 model years. The company says that due to contamination, parts in the wiper motor cover can interfere with one another. If snow or ice stops the wiper arms from stopping in the proper position, the wiper motor could overheat. That could disable the wipers and melt the cover. ___ American hopes IT switch doesn't snag flights this weekend DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines will make a big technology change this weekend involving planes and pilots, but passengers won't notice a thing if all goes well. Nearly three years after the merger that created the current American, the airline is switching to a single flight-operating system instead of running three separate systems. American expects the change to boost efficiency, but like anything involving technology and airlines, it comes with risk. In a memo to employees Friday, executives said hundreds would be staffing "command centers" around the clock in case of hiccups. ___ Eurozone inflation doubles as low oil price impact fades LONDON (AP) -- Inflation in the 19-country eurozone doubled in September to near two-year highs as the impact of lower oil prices began to fade, official figures showed Friday, in a development that's likely to ease pressure on the European Central Bank to provide more stimulus next month. Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, said the annual rate of inflation rose to 0.4 percent in September. The increase, which was in line with market expectations, took inflation to its highest level since October 2014, when it was also 0.4 percent. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager for Anglophone West Africa, made the disclosure in Lagos on Friday. Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager for Anglophone West Africa He said that information about the suspicious online financial scheme had relevance for Nigerians. Kola-Ogunlade said that many Zimbabweans were obviously wishing they could turn back the hand of the clock after losing their money on a popular online pyramid Ponzi scheme. He said the information was particularly relevant to Nigeria as the scheme had already surfaced in the country and was receiving good attention. “The Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox (MMM) Global Zimbabwe is a scheme that advertises itself as a mutual aid fund with a promised monthly investment returns of 30 per cent. “Under the scheme, members contribute money to assist others. However, it is a network that relies on growing numbers of new members to pay off the old. “It is linked to a fraudulent history that goes as far back as 1989. “This scheme is currently in Nigeria and it is called MMM Federal Republic of Nigeria. The business has started to receive attention from Nigerians. “On another day, there was another hoax in which some pranksters decided that the best way to honour number one Nigerian billionaire and Africa’s richest man in 2015 was to declare him dead.’’ Kola-Ogunlade said that the news of the billionaire Dangote dying in Germany after a short illness went viral on social media and was followed by emotions, including shock and surprise. “But hey! Dangote had this to say via Twitter, ‘I am hale, hearty and alive’, Kola-Ogunlade added. “People’s attention online was also captured by Google coming officially of age in some countries of course (and without rite of passage). “Now that Google is 18, it can vote, buy alcohol, cigarettes and do other grown-up stuff. “Google celebrated its ‘maturity’ on Sept. 27 with a special doodle displayed on its homepage around the world. “Although Google’s birthday has been marked on Sept. 27 for the past 10 years, it has not always been so, as history has it that Google.com was registered on Sept. 15, 1997 and incorporated on Sept. 4, 1998. “Furthermore, Google celebrated 2003 on Sept. 8; 2004 on Sept. 7; and 2005 on Sept. 26,’’ the Google spokesman explained. He said that the Mexican Peso reacted with a rise, in what would be the first in a series of presidential debates between U.S. presidential candidates Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. “Anxious viewers watched a demonstration of raw energy as the candidates argued over race, terrorism and jobs. “The debate was also a battle of emotional constraint, which saw Clinton wearing calm to force Trump into a defensive while the internet has been agog with who won the debate,’’ Kola-Ogunlade said. The Google manager said that passion moved Okiemute Ighorodje, former band lead singer and model, who had gone on to win N5 million and a brand new SUV in MTN Project Fame Season 9. “The 25-year-old graduate, with her contagious smile, emerged as a winner in the event, after an eight-week musical competition between commendable contestants. “Elizabeth emerged first runner-up, while Kitay was the second runner-up, each taking home a saloon car with N3 million and N2 million, respectively.” Kola-Ogunlade said that a much-loved series premier, Empire Season 3 was backed with fans (and perhaps the cast) already anxious for the next episodes. “Picking off where Season 2 left off, the cliffhanger scene between Rhonda and Anika — fans who were eager to know who fell off the building discover it is Rhonda. “But will that mean fans will not get to see her character anymore? “Another highlight Empire fans can look forward to is ‘Kitty’, a mega-superstar played by guest star, Mariah Carey, who is close friends with Cookie Lyon in the series,” the Google manager stated. Google Trends, launched in May 2006 allows one to see how popular search terms and their demography have been over time on the search engine.

Security robots. Customers feeling shaken by recent attacks at U.S. malls may not notice huge changes — but mall operators are testing and putting in place new technologies and other measures to offer people more protection without intruding too much on their shopping time. Mall executives say shoppers have been adamantly opposed to airport security tactics like metal detectors. So they're trying other things, and increasingly using mass notifications that let them send text and email alerts to tenants within seconds in case of a crisis. ___ A year of Alphabet: Great for Google, less so for moonshots SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Reorganizing itself under the umbrella company Alphabet has done wonders for Google — but less so for a grab bag of eclectic projects ranging from robotic cars to internet-beaming balloons, which are suffering costly growing pains. A year after Alphabet took shape, Google's revenue growth has accelerated — an unusual development for a company of its size. That success, however, also underscores Alphabet's dependence on the fickle business of placing digital ads in core Google products like search, Gmail and YouTube video. As a result, it remains vulnerable to swings in marketing budgets and stiffening competition from another equally ambitious rival, Facebook. ___ Stocks say 'never mind'; reverse recent losses as banks jump NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks climbed Friday as banks made a rapid recovery following a steep fall a day ago. Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. ___ Q&A: Will Deutsche Bank become the next Lehman Germany's biggest bank is looking shaky and some investors fear it could collapse and endanger the wider financial system. Some even wonder whether it might become the next Lehman Brothers, the U.S. bank whose failure unleashed the worst of the global financial crisis in 2008. Experts warn against drawing such quick conclusions. Deutsche Bank's shares are down 51 per cent so far this year and it's negotiating a multibillion-dollar fine in the U.S. that it could have trouble paying. But it's exactly because it is so big and important that it is unlikely to be allowed to simply fail, the way U.S. authorities did with Lehman. Here are some questions and answers about the bank and what it might mean for the rest of the world. ___ US consumer spending at weakest pace in 5 months WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumers scaled back their spending in August to its weakest pace in five months, reflecting a drop in spending on autos. Income growth also decelerated as wages and salary gains slowed following four strong months. Consumer spending was unchanged last month after solid gains of 0.4 per cent in July and 0.3 per cent in June, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the poorest showing since a similar flat reading in March. ___ From Ferraris to SUVs: 5 cars that shone at the Paris show PARIS (AP) — An obscenely powerful hybrid sports car, a family-friendly SUV with enough space for seven adults, and an electric vehicle that promises to keep going for over 300 miles (500 kilometres) on a single charge — these are some of the notable vehicles shining on the display stands under bright overhead lights at the Paris auto show. Executives at this year's show are talking about how the industry can adapt to — or, better yet, profit from — disruptive change such as electric engines, networked vehicles, car sharing, and autonomous driving. All that could start coming together between 2020 and 2025, some think. Right now, however, they have some cars they want to sell. Here are five of the vehicles getting the most attention at the Paris Mondial de L'Automobile, which opens to the public Saturday and runs through Oct. 16. If you are lucky enough to be in the City of Light, an adult ticket costs 16 euros ($17.90). ___ US closes probe of Jeep automatic braking; no recall sought DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety regulators have closed a yearlong investigation into the Jeep Grand Cherokee's automatic braking system without seeking a recall. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began the probe in June of last year after getting complaints that the system braked for no reason, increasing the risk of rear-end crashes. ___ BMW issues recall for new Takata air bag problem DETROIT (AP) — Another potentially deadly problem has surfaced with Takata air bags, this one forcing BMW to recall over 4,000 SUVs in the U.S. and Canada. The new problem was traced to improper welds, and it's separate from the trouble that has caused the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. ___ Subaru recalls about 593K cars; wiper motors can overheat DETROIT (AP) — Subaru is recalling nearly 593,000 vehicles, some for a second time, because windshield wiper motors can overheat and increase the risk of a fire. The recall affects certain Legacy and Outback cars from the 2010 to 2014 model years. The company says that due to contamination, parts in the wiper motor cover can interfere with one another. If snow or ice stops the wiper arms from stopping in the proper position, the wiper motor could overheat. That could disable the wipers and melt the cover. ___ American hopes IT switch doesn't snag flights this weekend DALLAS (AP) — American Airlines will make a big technology change this weekend involving planes and pilots, but passengers won't notice a thing if all goes well. Nearly three years after the merger that created the current American, the airline is switching to a single flight-operating system instead of running three separate systems. American expects the change to boost efficiency, but like anything involving technology and airlines, it comes with risk. In a memo to employees Friday, executives said hundreds would be staffing "command centres" around the clock in case of hiccups. ___ Eurozone inflation doubles as low oil price impact fades LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the 19-country eurozone doubled in September to near two-year highs as the impact of lower oil prices began to fade, official figures showed Friday, in a development that's likely to ease pressure on the European Central Bank to provide more stimulus next month. Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, said the annual rate of inflation rose to 0.4 per cent in September. The increase, which was in line with market expectations, took inflation to its highest level since October 2014, when it was also 0.4 per cent. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 17.14 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 5,312. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business Deutsche Bank AG Google Inc.         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   The Zed Horde Descends Upon Gamers World-Wide as KILLING FLOOR 2 Launches for PC, PlayStation®4 Pro and PlayStation®4 Perk Holiday Shopping Study Reveals That Half of Consumers Will Shop With Mobile on Cyber Monday On BizWireTV: CES 2017 Announces Best of Innovation Honorees and a New Game to Aid Better Sleep           News Business Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Health Travel Technology Don't Miss: Happening Now Video Centre Live chats Blogs on canada.com canada.com on Facebook Most Popular Formats Sitemap / RSS Contests Blogs Photo Galleries Videos Canada.com About Us Contact Us Advertise with Us FAQs Tools Canada.com Search for a Job Buy / Sell a Car Infomart Place a Classified Ad Newsletters and Alerts My Account Flyercity.ca About canada.com | Privacy Statement | Terms | Copyright & Permissions © 2010-2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Security robots. Customers feeling shaken by recent attacks at U.S. malls may not notice huge changes — but mall operators are testing and putting in place new technologies and other measures to offer people more protection without intruding too much on their shopping time. Mall executives say shoppers have been adamantly opposed to airport security tactics like metal detectors. So they’re trying other things, and increasingly using mass notifications that let them send text and email alerts to tenants within seconds in case of a crisis. ___ A year of Alphabet: Great for Google, less so for moonshots SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Reorganizing itself under the umbrella company Alphabet has done wonders for Google — but less so for a grab bag of eclectic projects ranging from robotic cars to internet-beaming balloons, which are suffering costly growing pains. A year after Alphabet took shape, Google’s revenue growth has accelerated — an unusual development for a company of its size. That success, however, also underscores Alphabet’s dependence on the fickle business of placing digital ads in core Google products like search, Gmail and YouTube video. As a result, it remains vulnerable to swings in marketing budgets and stiffening competition from another equally ambitious rival, Facebook. ___ Stocks say ‘never mind’; reverse recent losses as banks jump NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks climbed Friday as banks made a rapid recovery following a steep fall a day ago. Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany’s largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. ___ Q&A: Will Deutsche Bank become the next Lehman Germany’s biggest bank is looking shaky and some investors fear it could collapse and endanger the wider financial system. Some even wonder whether it might become the next Lehman Brothers, the U.S. bank whose failure unleashed the worst of the global financial crisis in 2008. Experts warn against drawing such quick conclusions. Deutsche Bank’s shares are down 51 per cent so far this year and it’s negotiating a multibillion-dollar fine in the U.S. that it could have trouble paying. But it’s exactly because it is so big and important that it is unlikely to be allowed to simply fail, the way U.S. authorities did with Lehman. Here are some questions and answers about the bank and what it might mean for the rest of the world. ___ US consumer spending at weakest pace in 5 months WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumers scaled back their spending in August to its weakest pace in five months, reflecting a drop in spending on autos. Income growth also decelerated as wages and salary gains slowed following four strong months. Consumer spending was unchanged last month after solid gains of 0.4 per cent in July and 0.3 per cent in June, the Commerce Department reported Friday. It was the poorest showing since a similar flat reading in March. ___ From Ferraris to SUVs: 5 cars that shone at the Paris show PARIS (AP) — An obscenely powerful hybrid sports car, a family-friendly SUV with enough space for seven adults, and an electric vehicle that promises to keep going for over 300 miles (500 kilometres) on a single charge — these are some of the notable vehicles shining on the display stands under bright overhead lights at the Paris auto show. Executives at this year’s show are talking about how the industry can adapt to — or, better yet, profit from — disruptive change such as electric engines, networked vehicles, car sharing, and autonomous driving. All that could start coming together between 2020 and 2025, some think. Right now, however, they have some cars they want to sell. Here are five of the vehicles getting the most attention at the Paris Mondial de L’Automobile, which opens to the public Saturday and runs through Oct. 16. If you are lucky enough to be in the City of Light, an adult ticket costs 16 euros ($17.90). ___ US closes probe of Jeep automatic braking; no recall sought DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety regulators have closed a yearlong investigation into the Jeep Grand Cherokee’s automatic braking system without seeking a recall. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began the probe in June of last year after getting complaints that the system braked for no reason, increasing the risk of rear-end crashes. ___ BMW issues recall for new Takata air bag problem DETROIT (AP) — Another potentially deadly problem has surfaced with Takata air bags, this one forcing BMW to recall over 4,000 SUVs in the U.S. and Canada. The new problem was traced to improper welds, and it’s separate from the trouble that has caused the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. ___ Subaru recalls about 593K cars; wiper motors can overheat DETROIT (AP) — Subaru is recalling nearly 593,000 vehicles, some for a second time, because windshield wiper motors can overheat and increase the risk of a fire. The recall affects certain Legacy and Outback cars from the 2010 to 2014 model years. The company says that due to contamination, parts in the wiper motor cover can interfere with one another. If snow or ice stops the wiper arms from stopping in the proper position, the wiper motor could overheat. That could disable the wipers and melt the cover. ___ American hopes IT switch doesn’t snag flights this weekend DALLAS (AP) — American Airlines will make a big technology change this weekend involving planes and pilots, but passengers won’t notice a thing if all goes well. Nearly three years after the merger that created the current American, the airline is switching to a single flight-operating system instead of running three separate systems. American expects the change to boost efficiency, but like anything involving technology and airlines, it comes with risk. In a memo to employees Friday, executives said hundreds would be staffing “command centres” around the clock in case of hiccups. ___ Eurozone inflation doubles as low oil price impact fades LONDON (AP) — Inflation in the 19-country eurozone doubled in September to near two-year highs as the impact of lower oil prices began to fade, official figures showed Friday, in a development that’s likely to ease pressure on the European Central Bank to provide more stimulus next month. Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, said the annual rate of inflation rose to 0.4 per cent in September. The increase, which was in line with market expectations, took inflation to its highest level since October 2014, when it was also 0.4 per cent. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 17.14 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 5,312. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Sep 30, 2016 at 5:30PM As Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) acquisition rumors continue to grab headlines, a number of technology giants have been named as likely buyers of the social media company. Among the Silicon Valley suitors is none other than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), which likely sees value in Twitter's large user base and developing video strategy. In this segment from Industry Focus: Technology, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann discuss the pitfalls of acquisitive behavior and potential better uses for Alphabet's large cash balance. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sept. 23, 2016. Dylan Lewis: Looking at some of the rumored acquirers, on my end, it's not really shocking to see Google's name thrown into the mix, here. You see, pretty much anytime there's been rumors about Twitter being acquired, Google has gotten lumped in there. They integrate tweets in the search results, so, clearly, they see some value in what the platform provides in terms of live content. Google has over $12 billion in cash at their disposal. They have $77 billion if you include their short-term investments. That's a lot to work with. David Kretzmann: They're doing OK. They've produced about $20 billion in free cash flow over the past year. Google has no shortage of cash. From Alphabet's perspective, I think Twitter could be attractive, because they still have a sizable platform of relatively engaged users. Online advertising, obviously, is Google's bread and butter. They might be able to transfer some of their learnings and expertise to Twitter and fine-tune the strategy there. If Twitter's move into live video streaming grabs hold, that could really compliment what Google is doing with YouTube and competing against Facebook Live for this emerging market of online video. There are a fair amount of parallels where it could make sense for Google. At the same time, I still worry that, just because Google has that mountain of cash, you don't want to overpay for an acquisition, as we've seen with Microsoft's reign under Steve Ballmer. Just because you have a lot of cash and spend it acquiring a lot of companies doesn't mean it's going to work out well for shareholders. You want to be sure that just because Google or some of these other companies have a lot of cash, it's still very important that they're getting a good value for the cash that they spend on acquisitions. Lewis: And just looking at what they've done as a company in the last year or so, particularly since Ruth Porat has hopped on, of the share repurchases, is one of the other ways they can use that cash. You have gone through almost all of that authorization now. So, it'll be interesting to see what happens with that. But that's another use for that cash that, as a shareholder, I wouldn't necessarily mind. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Director Julien Codorniou Tells Us At Disrupt London This December Save £250 On Tickets Now Weekly Roundup: Snapchat’s new Specs, Beyoncé is a tech investor and SpaceX’s plans to colonize Mars Posted Sep 30, 2016 by Anna Escher (@annaescher) 0 SHARES Next Story Apple is screwing up HomeKit; here’s how they can fix it This week, Elon Musk revealed SpaceX’s plan for humans to inhabit Mars, Google rebranded its cloud services and rumors swirled about a Twitter bid. These are the top stories of the week, and you can also receive them in your inbox. 1. The little blue bird may find a new home soon. Word is that Salesforce, Google, Microsoft and Verizon are all eyeing a Twitter bid. If Google buys, there’s a perfect spot for Twitter within YouTube. But Salesforce may be the best fit of all. 2. All eyes were on Elon Musk this week as he detailed SpaceX’s plans to colonize Mars. He believes humans have two options: One path is to stay on Earth forever and eventually face an extinction event. The alternative is to become a space-faring, multiplanetary species. He clarified that less than 5 percent of the company is actually working on the Mars mission, and a 2024 launch is optimistic. 3. If there’s one company cool enough to pull off the “computer on your face” concept, it’s Snapchat. The messaging company rebranded to Snap Inc. and made its first foray into hardware with the long-rumored camera glasses, the Spectacles. Yes, they’re actually real and will cost $130. But will they end up changing our behavior?  4. Google combined all its cloud services under the “Google Cloud” brand, and rebranded its business apps to G Suite. 5. Facebook wants work to be as addictive as socializing. Facebook at Work, the company’s enterprise communication and collaboration network, is launching on October 10. 6. A week after GoPro announced its new Karma drone, DJI introduced its new folding drone, the Mavic Pro. At $999, the Mavic is smaller and better at tracking than GoPro’s offering. 7. Queen Bey is bringing her business skills to the tech world. Beyoncé and the management company she started, Parkwood Entertainment, have invested $150,000 into Sidestep, an app for buying concert merchandise and skipping the line to pick it up at the show. 8. Where will AI lead us in the future? Facebook, Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft came together to launch the new Partnership on AI. The alliance was formed for the purpose of conducting research and promoting best practices when it comes to advancements in artificial intelligence. 9. This year, ClassPass jacked up its prices from a $100 monthly payment to a $180 monthly payment, at its highest, marking the first wave of doubt over its new-found business model. Following the price hike, the company lost 10 percent of its user base, but it was also the price that had to be paid to get ClassPass back to profitability. Here’s where the company is now. 10. New tech-backed voting initiatives seem to be popping up on the daily, and Silicon Valley is ready to spend. But will VC-funded registration apps and big-dollar donations really change the course of this election? 11. Contractors are preparing to boycott online grocery service Instacart over the elimination of tips. The new payment structure is meeting criticism because it will eliminate tips, but guarantee a delivery commission. Only the full-service shoppers (contractors) are affected. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Nom Launches Redesigned App VIDEO | 3:17 | Apps Shareholders approve Tesla acquisition of SolarCity 16 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Airbnb is turning itself into an ‘experience’ machine beyond just booking places to stay 19 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Open source and coopetition are the new normal 20 hours ago | Ron Miller YC tries a new experiment: temporary partners 20 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From TechCrunch Apple adds former Wall Street Journal editor to its China PR team 1 hour ago | Jon Russell French IoT startup Sigfox confirms €150M Series E at €600M valuation 2 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden Telemedicine company Syounika Online snags top prize at TechCrunch Tokyo 3 hours ago | Haje Jan Kamps Three UK suffers major data breach via compromised employee login 3 hours ago | Natasha Lomas Comment moderation powered by Up Next Apple is screwing up HomeKit; here’s how they can fix it Posted Sep 30, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Director, Software Security @ Practice Fusion at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Developer at CastleBranch (Wilmington, NC, United States) Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Google has introduced a free version of a tool designed to help organizations deliver more personalized experiences for users visiting their websites. The company's new Google Optimize, released this week in beta form, allows website owners to test webpages and their entire site to discover opportunities for engaging visitors more effectively. With it, administrators and webmasters will be able to test different features on their site and then tweak them to deliver a more personalized experience for each customer. The tool is built on top of Google Analytics so site owners and administrators will be able to use existing site data to quickly identify areas for improvement, according to an official description of Google Optimize. A Google Optimize WYSIWYG editor gives administrators the ability to change anything on their site to test new features, without having to recode the site each time to do so. The editor lets administrators edit text, images and layouts on the fly by simply clicking on the feature they want to change. The goal is to give website owners an easy way to see how different features and tweaks on their site will work in improving user experience. "It's easy to understand and act on results," said Google Optimize product managers Jon Mesh and Dan Cary, in announcing beta availability of the tool on the company's Analytics Blog. "Google Optimize calculates results based on your existing Google Analytics metrics and business objectives. It's clear to see what you should do next to drive even more impact for your business." Google Optimize supports the ability for organizations to run different kinds of site usability tests. For instance, it lets administrators create and deploy what are known as A/B tests in which they can compare two versions of the same page to determine which one makes more of an impression on users. Similarly, Optimize enables easier creation and deployment of multivariate tests to determine the optimal combination of site features and functions, Mesh and Cary said. According to the two product managers, the free version of Optimize gives site owners everything they need to get started on usability tests for their sites. Optimize 360, the paid for version, offers more robust testing and site experiments and helps site owners more directly in delivering custom experiences for users, they said. Optimize is not the only Google analytics tool for which a free version is now available. Earlier this year, Google released a free version of its Google Data Studio reporting and data visualization product. The tool, currently in beta form, is available in 21 countries and basically enables businesses to extract insights for making better decisions regarding the usability of their websites. Google's goal in offering free versions of its analytics tools is to make it easier for website owners to compete on personalized marketing and customer experience.

Crunch Network Apple is screwing up HomeKit; here’s how they can fix it Posted Sep 30, 2016 by Daniel Conrad 0 SHARES Next Story Nutanix up 131% on first day of trading Daniel Conrad Crunch Network Contributor Daniel is co-founder of Beep Networks, and was an early product manager on Google's Android and Access teams. More posts by this contributor: Three reasons carriers are building new cell networks for the Internet of Things How to join the network The real magic of the Internet of Things happens when devices work together. It will be magic when Siri, on your iPhone, can adjust your thermostat or confirm that you locked the back door; when your door lock can tell your sound system you’re home and you don’t even have to push a button to start the music. That’s not the reality we live in today, because most devices can’t talk to each other. Without a common language, this magic can’t happen. Apple (through HomeKit) and Google (through Works with Nest) have introduced programs to enable this type of communication. As owners of the two dominant mobile phone platforms, they are both well-positioned to set standards for in-home device communication. And yet, Works with Nest adoption is light years ahead of HomeKit. Looking at the numbers: Apple’s website currently boasts HomeKit-compatible devices from 7 manufacturers. The Works with Nest page shows 95. Nest connects to washing machines, pet feeders and baby monitors. HomeKit works with Philips lights and not much else. Apple’s been making devices for a long time. They’re in a lot more homes than Nest, and their retail stores should give them a tremendous advantage in attracting partners. Also, connecting to iPhone should be easy. So why does Nest have an order of magnitude more device partners? Hardware is slow, software is fast The fundamental difference in approach is one of hardware versus software. Apple requires hardware integration. Nest does integrations in the cloud. Our team built one of the first devices that connected to Nest. The integration and certification test process took one engineer a few days to complete. Nearly everything happens in the cloud, not on the user’s local Wi-Fi network. It didn’t hurt that we were well-supported by the team at Nest, or that their documentation is publicly available and excellent. Or that Firebase is awesome. (Google actually acquired Firebase — maybe just to make Works With Nest even better?) Apple does things totally differently. You have to apply for access to the MFi developer program to even look at the documentation for HomeKit hardware integration. Seriously, you have to wait weeks for approval just to read the HomeKit device requirements. Apple requires an authentication chip be added to your hardware that you can only buy from them. Existing products can not be connected to HomeKit without this change to their electrical design. It’s like in a world with email, they’re asking us to use a fax machine. You also have to build your product with one of their approved manufacturers. If your current manufacturer is not on the list, you must move your line to a new factory. You have to test and certify your device in one of Apple’s approved labs. I understand there are only a few of them  —  a friend here in San Francisco had to send his devices to the U.K. for testing. I’ve even heard that Apple reviews your packaging to make sure the colors don’t clash with their branding schemes. I’m honestly choosing not to believe that that’s true —  but maybe it is. Integrations belong in the cloud Most importantly, Apple requires much of the device-to-device integration to happen on the local Wi-Fi network  —  rather than talk to servers, your device talks to an iPhone through the local Wi-Fi network, and the iPhone talks to the other devices. That means that HomeKit logic must be baked into the firmware on the device itself, and any future modifications or extensions of the system mean updating that firmware. This is not how it’s supposed to work in the days of the internet. Devices should be connected to the cloud. In the cloud, servers can talk to each other. We can fix bugs without risky over-the-air firmware updates. To be clear, there is a place for non-cloud connections between devices. We used to ship a music synchronization device, and the low-latency communications we needed required local communication. Nest offers the Weave platform for local communication between devices, too. Bluetooth devices can’t connect to a Wi-Fi access point, so they need to communicate with a phone directly. But there’s no reason to require integration at the device level when you can do it in the cloud. This is nuts It’s strange to me that Apple can get this so wrong. It’s like in a world with email, they’re asking us to use a fax machine. Related Articles Apple works to fit the smart home under a single roof Why Apple wants to be the smart home's nerve center Here's How To Use Siri Commands On iOS Devices With HomeKit Accessories My first thought is that they might want to limit the quantity of devices to improve the average quality. If they make it expensive enough, maybe only the best devices will get through. The Amazon reviews on First Alert’s HomeKit smoke detector suggest otherwise. In today’s day and age it’s often not the rich companies building the best devices. Maybe it’s just that Apple fundamentally still thinks like a hardware company. That is, when they think of integrations, they instinctively begin with lists of hardware requirements. Whatever their goal, the end result is that HomeKit is going to fail unless Apple changes its approach. I hope they do. God knows Nest could use a healthy competitor. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase HomeKit Description HomeKit is a framework in iOS 8 for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user’s home.

The service puts Google in competition with Uber’s UberPool and Lyft’s Line services, but with some key differences in the business model. While the aforementioned Uber and Lyft services are basically swapouts for taxis that let you split the cost of your trip with another rider headed in the same direction, Google said it intends to have the Waze app match drivers and riders already looking to move in the same direction. The driver is only reimbursed for mileage driven at a maximum of 54 cents per mile — Google says it doesn't believe drivers need to report any payment as income because it is considered gas money. Coordination, communication, and payment are automatically handled through the mobile apps. According to an account by a Wall Street Journal reporter taking a trip from San Francisco’s financial district to Oakland — roughly a 20-minute ride — Google paid the driver $6.30 and charged the rider just $3 — factoring in a discount for the service’s launch. The same ride outside of rush hour would cost $23 to $30 on Uber or Lyft, according to the companies’ apps. Those in the San Francisco Bay Area can register via the original Waze app, but riders must make requests via the separate Waze Rider app. For now at least, drivers aren't subject to a background check, nor are they required to provide a photo ID, they are just required to provide Waze with a schedule overview in addition to their home and work addresses.

The Android Wear 2.0 developer preview program will continue throughout the rest of this year and in to 2017, with watches set to get the final build early next year. Google announced the availability of the third developer preview several days ago, and the company says another developer preview will be released before the update is sent to OEMs. In the third developer preview, Google has added the Play Store to Android Wear 2.0. It may seem a little cramped, however users can now browse and install apps directly from their watch, rather than using the equivalent app on their smartwatch. Searching for apps is as easy as using voice commands, the tiny Android Wear keyboard, or handwriting. The Play Store on Android Wear also allows you to install only the watch app, provided the app supports this feature of Android Wear 2.0. This prevents apps you only use on your watch from clogging up the app tray on your smartphone. The choice to delay Android Wear 2.0 until next year seems to fit with the plans of major Android Wear OEMs such as LG, Motorola and Huawei, who decided to hold off releasing any new smartwatches during the fall. In early 2017 we could see a major relaunch of Android Wear complete with new devices running the updated operating system.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad A year of Alphabet: Great for Google, less so for moonshots By Associated Press Published: 19:16 EST, 30 September 2016 | Updated: 19:17 EST, 30 September 2016 e-mail SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Reorganizing itself under the umbrella company Alphabet has done wonders for Google — but less so for a grab bag of eclectic projects ranging from robotic cars to internet-beaming balloons, which are suffering costly growing pains. A year after Alphabet took shape, Google's revenue growth has accelerated — an unusual development for a company of its size. That success, however, also underscores Alphabet's dependence on the fickle business of placing digital ads in core Google products like search, Gmail and YouTube video. As a result, it remains vulnerable to swings in marketing budgets and stiffening competition from another equally ambitious rival, Facebook. Alphabet was supposed to speed the process of turning offshoot businesses into new technological jackpots. CEO Larry Page predicted that separating these smaller "moonshots" from the massive search-and-advertising business would spur innovation by fostering a more entrepreneurial atmosphere. FILE - In this Monday, Feb. 1, 2016, file photo, electronic screens post the price of Alphabet stock at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York. Google has been thriving since adopting Alphabet Inc. as its corporate parent in 2015, underscoring how much the company still depends on digital advertising despite spending heavily on quirky projects in search of another technological jackpot. The performance serves as a reminder of the challenge facing Alphabet as it tries to become something more than a one-trick pony and build an innovation factory. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) That hasn't happened during Alphabet's first year. MAKING THE SHIFT Until Page and fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin created Alphabet (which turns 1 on Sunday), investors complained that Google was spending too much on high-risk efforts. New Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who joined Google in mid-2015, responded by reining in expenses to keep them more in line with revenue growth. A few months later, Page announced the plan to draw a dividing line between Google and the far-flung forays Alphabet now refers to as "Other Bets." The mishmash includes smart-thermostat maker Nest; the Fiber project, a high-speed internet service; and X lab, where the company is building robotic cars and designing the stratospheric balloons designed to beam internet service to remote areas. Other "Other Bets" include the biotech firm Verily and medical-research firm Calico, which has been studying ways to stop aging. Alphabet also runs funds investing in startups and mid-sized companies. Page argued that fencing off Other Bets would make Google "even better through greater focus." CORE SUCCESSES That part of Page's vision appears to be panning out. After subtracting ad commissions, Alphabet's second-quarter revenue jumped 22 percent from the previous year to $17.5 billion. It was the best performance in four years, adjusted for changes in currency exchange rates, says RBC analyst Mark Mahaney. Alphabet shares rose 25 percent over the past year, easily outpacing major market indexes. "Folks will be hard pressed to say that Alphabet hasn't been a success," S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Scott Kessler says. Alphabet Inc. declined to comment on its first-year performance. But Sundar Pichai, who became Google's CEO in the restructuring, told investors in July, "There is an amazing energy right now." Among other things, Google has been making strides in the still-nascent field of artificial intelligence, hoping to create more convenient services that attract even more eyeballs for its advertisers. STALLED BETS But the demand for financial discipline and accountability appears to have taken a toll on Other Bets, which lose billions of dollars a year. Key leaders have defected from Alphabet's high-profile self-driving car project and its Nest line of internet-connected devices. Alphabet also has scaled back plans to expand its Fiber service to dozens of U.S. cities. Creating a holding company also was supposed to make it easier to diversify through major acquisitions. But Alphabet's biggest deal so far has been the $625 million purchase of a business software maker, Apigee Corp., which had annual revenue of just $92 million. Alphabet could make a much bigger splash if buys Twitter, as recent reports say it is considering. Twitter would give Alphabet a popular publishing outlet to monitor trends, mine data and sell even more ads. Alphabet declined to discuss whether it's mulling a bid, which would be expensive; Twitter might fetch between $20 and $30 billion, despite its problems with user growth and online harassment. LOOKING BEYOND Google is doing so well that investors aren't fixating on the losses with Other Bets, Kessler says. Only three Bets — Nest, Fiber and Verily — are generating even a smidgen of revenue. In nine months, the Other Bets companies have lost a combined $2.6 billion on revenue of $410 million. Another big loss is expected in the July-September quarter; the company reports results on Oct. 27. BGC analyst Colin Gillis still sees the gamble as prudent and expects at least one of the projects will come up with a breakthrough that lessens Alphabet's dependence on Google. Optimism is fine as Google keeps growing at a robust rate. But Wall Street will likely ratchet up the pressure if the company falters and nothing emerges from Other Bets to help pick up the slack. ___ This story has been corrected to change spelling of first reference to a biotech firm to Verily instead of Verify.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google adds detailed college info cards to Search Brittany A. Roston - Sep 30, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It’s that time of year — a bunch of people are agonizing over which college to attend, and Google plays a large part in their research. To help expedite and flesh out that research process, Google has announced the addition of detailed college data cards in Search, presenting a bunch of information about the institution in one easy-to-read place. The data presented is gathered from the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard, says Google. You can see examples of data in the screenshots below — the info you get depends on what university or college you search, of course, and includes things like the cost of undergraduate attendance, graduation rates, acceptance rates, how much it costs for those who are getting federal aid, and how much the institution’s graduates make on average after graduating. Obviously, it doesn’t cover all the aspects of a university or college, but it does provide a snapshot of some of the most important information prospective students will care about, and that quickly speeds up the research process. If you’re only interested in colleges with a certain graduation rate, for example, this makes quick work of weeding out unwanted institutions. Of course, you have the option to star some colleges if you want, and to scroll through the search results for other sources of information. When researching colleges on mobile, I’m also presented with lists of public events at the institution with dates, as well as a score for the institution based on web reviews. The information doesn’t show up in desktop searches.

With the $10 all-access individual plan, you get unlimited music and an ad-free experience on YouTube, which can be an awesome deal. But Google’s 10 device authorization limit for streaming music can sometimes get in the way… Due to copyright laws, Google wants to make sure people are not taking advantage of their Play Music accounts, which is why they have to enforce a 10 device limit. The caveat, though, is that you are only allowed to deauthorize a maximum of four devices per calendar year. While most users will probably not have an issue with this, there are times — especially if you’re an Android writer, for example — that you just don’t want to use up one of your authorizations. Thankfully, there’s an imperfect solution: streaming from your phone or tablet’s mobile browser. Full instructions below, in case you don’t know how to do this: Open up the Chrome browser on your phone or tablet Go to music.google.com. A splashscreen will load and direct you to the Play Music app to listen to music Tap on the three-dot menu icon in the upper right-hand side of the screen and check the box next to Request desktop site The website should now automatically reload with the full desktop version of the webpage You will now be able to scroll around the website and start listening to music without using one of your device authorizations Guides Android Basics View THe Guide Google Play Music View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Read this Google Maps, Offers and the big wearable technology picture Google Maps is getting a coupons and deals infusion in a move that will become increasingly handy as wearable technology accelerates. Read More Now, when you leave for a meeting, you will no longer have to open the Google Calendar app for the address attached to the event. An "Upcoming" tab within the Google Maps "Your places" section will list events pulled directly from Calendar. "With your Google Calendar events on the map, now you've got one more way to personalize and make the most of your Google Maps experience," wrote Zach Maier, product manager at Google Maps, in a blog post. The update also adds labeling for saved locations and Google Contacts integration to navigate to your friends house by searching for their name -- as long as their address is saved under Google Contacts. Earlier this week, Google added a new series of voice commands to Google Maps for Android, allowing drivers to use voice commands and ask questions without having to pickup their handsets.

The app will use Waze's navigation system to learn the routes drivers most frequently take to work and match them up with people looking for a ride in the same direction. It has previously been tested with firms around Google's office, but is now available across the Bay Area, according to the Wall Street Journal. WazeRider finds you the most convenient, affordable ride to work from fellow commuters already driving with Waze Commuters will pay fellow drivers a small fee for a ride to and from work. Google is limiting drivers and riders to two rides a day—intended to be to and from work—and made it cheap, restricting drivers from making a living on the app. Waze’s current pilot charges riders at most 54 cents a mile, far less than most Uber and Lyft rides - and, for now, Google doesn’t take a cut, the WSJ says.  It was first tested last year in Tel Aviv - but is now available across Israel.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Are geese taking over your town?

Share this article Share 71 shares Google bought Israel-based Waze, which uses satellitesignals from members' smartphones to offer real-time trafficinformation, for about $1 billion two years ago.  'WazeRider finds you the most convenient, affordable ride to work from fellow commuters already driving with Waze, the world's largest community-based traffic and navigation app,' the app page says. 'Ask for a ride, and we’ll connect you to a fellow commuter on your route who’s willing to help. The firm says the payments will be small, to 'help cover the cost of driving.' 'WazeRider will then suggest a nominal payment to help with the cost of gas & wear and tear.' The firm says the payments will be small, to 'help cover the cost of driving.'  Drivers will be limited to just two journeys a day and willnot be able to earn a salary from RideWith, a source close tothe company said, differentiating it from businesses such asUber, where drivers can turn a profit. The move will put Google in a head on battle with Uber Should RideWith be rolled out globally, this limitationcould help it avoid the backlash Uber is facing in a number ofcountries that want to protect professional taxi drivers. Waze does not expect there to be enough drivers to meetdemand at first, but as more sign on, passengers will be able toorder a ride either to or from work while chipping in a bit forthe cost of gas and wear and tear on the car, the source said. The new application, called RideWith, uses Waze's navigation system to learn the routes drivers most frequently take to work and match them up with people looking for a ride in the same direction.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats.

ALSO READ Google rebrands cloud business, adds more artificial intelligence We cannot use data of business customers for advertising: Google's global product strategist Google zeroes in on cloud offerings Google India showcases cloud-centric enterprise solutions Amazon, lifted by cloud services, reports $857-mn net income Alphabet's Google said on Thursday it renamed its business-to-business cloud computing brand and enhanced some enterprise applications using artificial intelligence, the company's latest gambit to better compete with Amazon.com and Microsoft in the lucrative cloud business. Discussing the rebranded Google Cloud, Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google's enterprise business, said the company has made good progress courting customers and improving its technology. Cloud computing uses remote internet servers to store, manage and process data, and Google offers a range of apps like word processing and email, as well as the ability to host data and offer resources for developers. The new name replaces the Google for Work brand. "We are closing the gap incredibly fast" with competitors, Greene, a former CEO of VMware who joined Google last year to ramp up its cloud business, told experts and journalists at an event. Analysts say Google trails Amazon and Microsoft in market share but is gaining under Greene. Although the business is not big enough to break out separately in its quarterly earnings statement, Google reported a 33 per cent surge in "other revenue" in its most recent quarter, which analysts said was probably due largely to gains in cloud computing. Greene has moved quickly to streamline engineering and appointed new leadership to beef up the company's cloud business. This has helped improve sales, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Earlier this month, Google acquired cloud software company Apigee in a deal valued at about $625 million.

Discussing the rebranded Google Cloud, Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google's enterprise business, said the company has made good progress courting customers and improving its technology. Cloud computing uses remote internet servers to store, manage and process data, and Google offers a range of apps like word processing and email, as well as the ability to host data and offer resources for developers. The new name replaces the Google for Work brand. "We are closing the gap incredibly fast" with competitors, Greene, a former CEO of VMware who joined Google last year to ramp up its cloud business, told experts and journalists at an event. Analysts say Google trails Amazon and Microsoft in market share but is gaining under Greene. Although the business is not big enough to break out separately in its quarterly earnings statement, Google reported a 33 per cent surge in "other revenue" in its most recent quarter, which analysts said was probably due largely to gains in cloud computing. Greene has moved quickly to streamline engineering and appointed new leadership to beef up the company's cloud business. This has helped improve sales, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Earlier this month, Google acquired cloud software company Apigee in a deal valued at about $625 million.

Google Sheets Explore More like this Free data visualization with Microsoft Power BI: Your step-by-step guide Lessons from high-profile IT failures 60+ R resources to improve your data skills Video How the FCC fast-tracked its journey to the cloud Spreadsheet software that will understand natural-language questions about your data is certainly a cool concept. Microsoft Power BI's cloud service -- its analytics platform, not Excel -- has offered this capability for a while, but having it percolate down to spreadsheets will put it before many more potential users. I've been taking Google Sheets Explore for a test drive this afternoon. First thoughts? It's got a lot of potential, but at the moment I'd caution you not to depend on it to understand exactly what you mean in the same way that, say, Google search can sometimes figure out what you want even if you've misspelled a word. Here's why. One of the sample problems Google uses in its blog post about Explore is "what are the top three items by sales price?" That's a pretty clear question and a fairly simple response: Return the three items with the largest sales price. But what if your spreadsheet has catgories as well, and you want the three priciest items in each category? I tried to find out something similar, using a spreadsheet with a month's worth of commercial airline flights arriving in Boston. When I typed in a question asking for the top three delays by airline, I got the three most-delayed flights altogether (along with which airline was responsible for each). Typing "What were the top three ARR_DELAY grouped by Airline" didn't work. Neither did "What were the top three ARR_DELAY for each Airline?" When I asked "What was the Mean ARR_DELAY by Airline" I received the appropriate response. "Average ARR_DELAY" worked as well. However, "What was the Median ARR_DELAY by Airline" returned the median for all flights. That's curiously inconsistent behavior, especially since Google Sheets pivot tables can calculate medians by group. For those who were hoping Explore would be a simple way to type out natural-language instructions whenever you want a pivot table, the platform isn't quite there, at least yet. Next up: Counts by group. "What is the COUNT of each Airline" gave me just the total number of rows in my spreadsheet. So did "What is the count by Airline" If I typed in "Airline," I got a list of unique Airlines in the data. Was this an impossible request? No, it turns out that "Distribution of Airline" is the correct phrase to get a count grouped by Airline. ("Airline Distribution," however, couldn't be understood.) "Count of [some other column] by Airline" also ended up giving me a count of records for each Airline. I'll be the first to admit that "Distribution of [variable of my choice]" is a lot easier to remember than creating a new pivot table. But if Explore is truly designed to be "natural language" as opposed to a simplified SQL requiring specific syntax, it needs some better understanding. To be fair, Power BI has similar problems understanding my queries, although it sometimes seems to provide a bit more guidance while developing questions. Being a BI tool, it has some other advantages, such as natural-language requests for visualizations -- you can ask it to generate a graph of your results. Google Sheets Explore offers some automated visualizations of your data, and you can easily add those to your spreadsheet with a single click. But as far as I can tell, if a visualization isn't generated in Explore automatically, there isn't a way to ask it to make you one. But back to Explore's natural-language capabilities. One of the best tips for using this new functionality is to look carefully at the Answer text which displays just under your question and above your results. It will tell you how it interpreted your question, such as "Average of DEP_DELAY by Airline" if you asked it "What is the mean of DEP_DELAY by airline?" That's probably the best way to ensure what you've requested is also what Sheets has understood.

18 Nov 2016 Local World Business Sports Tech titans join to study artificial intelligence Posted on 1 October 2016 - 03:38am MAJOR technology firms have joined forces in a partnership on artificial intelligence, aiming to cooperate on "best practices" on using the technology "to benefit people and society." Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Google-owned British AI firm DeepMind on Wednesday announced a non-profit organisation called "Partnership on AI" focused on helping the public understand the technology and practices in the field. The move comes amid concerns that new artificial intelligence efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society. The companies "will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology," according to a statement. Academics, non-profit groups, and specialists in policy and ethics will be invited to join the board of the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (Partnership on AI). Microsoft on Thursday meanwhile took a further step on artificial intelligence, announcing a unit devoted to "democratising" the technology, with more than 5,000 computer scientists and engineers. Microsoft expected its new AI and Research Group to speed up putting human-like thinking into virtual assistants, applications, services and computing infrastructures. "We are focused on empowering both people and organisations, by democratising access to intelligence to help solve our most pressing challenges," Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a release. "To do this, we are infusing AI into everything we deliver across our computing platforms and experiences." The new unit will include scientists from Microsoft Research, Bing and Cortana product groups, and its Ambient Computing and Robotics teams. Late last year, SpaceX founder and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI devoted to developing artificial intelligence that will help people and not hurt them. Musk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of a salvation. Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are among technology giants that have been investing in making machines smarter, contending the goal is to improve lives. "If we create some digital super-intelligence that exceeds us in every way by a lot, it is very important that it be benign," Musk said at a Code Conference in California in June. A danger, he contended, was that highly advanced artificial intelligence would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilisation as a whole. — AFP Share this news: Lifestyle Opinion Property Education Media & Marketing Community Photos Home Contact Us RSS Archive Advertise with Us View desktop version Copyright © 2016 Sun Media Corporation Sdn.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Fix Kodi’s YouTube “Quota Exceeded” Problem Are you sick of Kodi’s YouTube plugin constantly crashing, and giving you cryptic error messages like “Exception in ContentProvider” and “Quota Exceeded”? Here’s how to fix that problem with just a few minutes of work. We’ve shown you how to watch live TV on Kodi, but to be honest I don’t do that very often. YouTube is better than television, and Kodi puts YouTube right on my TV. The remote-driven interface makes it easy to browse my subscriptions, and to check out any channel’s complete archives and playlists. Binging YouTube channels is bliss. But lately, YouTube on Kodi is buggy, with error messages popping up when I try to do basic things. The problem, it seems, is related to the API keys used by add-on developers. Google (which owns YouTube) caps API usage, and Kodi’s rapidly growing user base means the YouTube plugin hits that cap every day, typically long before I start watching videos in the evening on the west coast. I was able to write these instructions thanks to steps outlined on the official Kodi forum, by forum member jmh2002. That outline is great, and I’m thankful for it, but I thought users might like easy-to-follow instructions with screenshots. Hopefully Google and the Kodi team can work out a long-term solution. In the meantime, however, you can fix YouTube yourself, by creating your own API keys. Here’s how. Step One: Set up a Project In Google Cloud Console First, head to Google Cloud Platform. Once there click “Project”, then “Create project.” Name your project whatever you like; I went with “YouTube-Kodi”. While you’re doing this, feel free to ignore any calls to pay for Google’s service. That’s for serious developers, and you’re just some person trying to get YouTube to work. Step Two: Enable YouTube Data API Next, head to the Libraries section on Google Cloud Console. Click “YouTube Data API”. On the next page, click “Enable.” There is a chance you’ll be told to create a project first, even though you just created one. If that happens, you’re going too fast, apparently. Wait a few minutes and try again, you speed demon you. You may also need to click “Create Project” and select your new YouTube-Kodi project from the list. Step Three: Create an API Key Next, head to the credentials page. Click “Create Credentials”, then “API Key”. A window will pop up with your shiny new API key, a 39-character string of numbers and letters. Copy the entire key, and save it in a document on your computer. Label it “API Key” for your own reference. Step Four: Create Some More Credentials Staying on the Credentials page, click “Create Credentials” followed by “OAuth client ID”. On the next page, click “Other”, then choose whatever name you’d like. (I went with “Kodi”.) Click “Create” and you’ll be given two new keys: a “client ID”, a 45-character string of numbers and letters followed by “apps.googleusercontent.com”. Copy this to your reference document, removing “apps.googleusercontent.com” and labeling the key “Client ID” for reference. You’ll also get a “Client Secret”, which is a 24-character string of letters and numbers. Copy this to you document, labeling it “Client Secret” for reference. Step Five: Paste Your Keys Into YouTube Now we’re ready to fire up Kodi and finally fix this thing. If you haven’t already, sign into your YouTube account inside the Kodi YouTube plugin. You’ll be asked to head to youtube.com/activate and enter an 8-digit code. You can do this on any device, not just the device Kodi is running on. Do this twice, as instructed. Next, pull up the sub-menu for the YouTube plugin. You can do this by selecting the plugin, then pressing the letter C on your keyboard. Open “Add-on settings”, then head to the “API Key” tab. Ensure “Enable Personal API Keys” is turned on, then paste the keys you gathered earlier in the appropriate places. (My keys are blurred out in the image above so you don’t steal them. Get your own keys, guys.) A Few Features Are Still Broken After setting up my own API keys, YouTube basically works for me again. Browsing my subscriptions and popular videos is fast, as is browsing YouTube channels. Error messages are a thing of the past. Having said that, two features still don’t work for me: my Watch Later List, and my History. These features have problems outside the API, and hopefully will be patched in future releases of the add-on. Beyond that, I couldn’t be happier. I have YouTube back in Kodi, and all is right with the world. I hope this tutorial helps you too. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (1 REPLY) Got Feedback?

If you’re not paying attention 24/7, it’s easy to miss some of the best stuff. Each week we will highlight five of the best new or overlooked apps and games. You’re sure to find some hidden gems in these recommendations. Go forth and download! 1. Revolution Icons There’s been a lot of talk lately about Google mandating round icons for Android. We don’t know for sure how that will end up, but if you want to try the circular look, Revolution is an excellent icon pack. Over 1,500 icons have been recreated with the circle theme in mind. Apps that don’t have custom icons are automatically converted to circles. The icon pack is free and has no ads or permissions. DOWNLOAD: Revolution Icon Pack – Google Play Price: Free In-app Purchases: No Rating: 4.1/5 Installs: 10,000 – 50,000 2. News Pro News Pro is a unique news reader from the Microsoft Garage team. The app delivers a customized selection of news stories based on the networks you choose to use. If you tweet a lot about football you’ll find stories about the NFL. You can tap on a topic to see more stories and customize the news by tapping “see more” or “see less like this.” If there’s a specific website you don’t like you can prevent it from showing up in the app. DOWNLOAD: News Pro – Google Play Price: Free In-app Purchases: No Rating: 3.6/5 Installs: 100 – 500 3. Candid Candid is a place for discussing your favorite things candidly. Everything is anonymous, which means you can say what you really want to say without anyone knowing your identity. You can see posts from people in your neighborhood or dive into broader topics to have conversations with people from around the world. Anonymous communities can get toxic, but moderators keep the conversations civil. You might be surprised what you find. DOWNLOAD: Candid – Google Play Price: Free In-app Purchases: No Rating: 3.7/5 Installs: 100,000 – 500,000 4. Orbt Orbt is a game all about orbiting planets. All you have to do is touch the screen to stop your planet from being sucked into a black hole. Every time you touch the screen the orbit pulls away from the black hole. As you’re orbiting there will be all sorts of things being sucked in around you. Avoid those obstacles and the black hole as long as possible. The closer you are to the black hole the more points you can earn. DOWNLOAD: Orbt – Google Play Price: Free In-app Purchases: Yes Rating: 4.7/5 Installs: 1,000 – 5,000 5. Roofbot In Roofbot you are in control of a hovering robot on rooftops. To play the game you simply swipe in the direction you want to move. You can only move one space at a time, and the space you were previously on drops away when you move. To finish a level you must pick up and drop shapes in the correct spots and get to the end. The path you take is very important because you can’t go over the same space twice.

This can be a helpful tool because now, instead of opening up a calendar event and then copying the address into Maps, you can just pull up a list of upcoming events without leaving the Google Maps app iself… Once you have received the latest version of Google Maps — which is currently rolling out worldwide to Android users — open up the sidebar and tap on “Your places.” Here you will find a list saved addresses, saved locations, and now a new tab called “Upcoming.” Here you will see all of your upcoming events from Google Calendar as well as any reservations or bookings from Gmail. To make sure that your events will appear on Google Maps you first have to make sure an address has been added to the “where” section of a calendar event. As long as Google sees that the event has an address and you’re using the same Google account for Calendar and Maps, you should have a list of everything that is upcoming. In addition to these changes, you can now add custom labels to specific addresses so that you can navigate to them more easily. Simply type in the address, click on the label button, and add a custom name to the location. The next time you plan to take a trip to that address, all you need to do is either start typing in the name of the place or use a voice command to set up directions. Lastly, you’ll now be able to see all of your Google contacts addresses from within Google Maps and have full control over what personal content you want to see on your maps. Simply go to the Settings menu from the slide out menu and toggle on or off whatever content you want or don’t want to show. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

By Angelica Mari for Brazil Tech | September 30, 2016 -- 19:09 GMT (12:09 PDT) | Topic: Google Google has announced plans to launch its cloud platform in Brazil to cater for growing service demand from local organisations. Brazil will be the first Latin American country to be part of the Google Cloud Network and becomes the eighth region of the portfolio in addition to Northern Virginia in the US, Singapore, Germany, Australia, India, Finland and the UK. The Industry Cloud: Why It's Next Read More The Brazil-based infrastructure will be available from 2017 and will serve businesses that require local data hosting. The location will remain undisclosed for security reasons and services will be charged in US dollars. Google's global infrastructure expansion is part of an overall refocusing of its cloud strategy and plans to become predominantly a cloud services provider by 2020. The firm is eager to catch up with other providers such as Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, who have been making investments to accommodate cloud demand from Brazilian businesses. According to IDC, the Brazilian cloud services market should see yearly growth of 20 percent by 2020. The segment - which was largely spared by the recession as local users sought to boost efficiency while reducing cost - should also see a jump in market revenues from $328.8m in 2013 to $1.1bn by 2017, according to Frost & Sullivan.

Google controls a majority market share in India in search, email and on smartphones through is Android operating system. It also has a significant presence in offering enterprise applications such as mail and other services, but lags behind Microsoft and Amazon in its cloud business. Amazon has three data centres, one each in Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, with over 75,000 customers, including taxi hailing app Ola, Tata Motors and television network NDTV, on its cloud. Last year, Microsoft set up three data centres in India offering its Azure cloud to local customers. ALSO READ: Google rebrands cloud business, adds more artificial intelligence Google, which already hosts applications of its Indian customers such as Wipro, Ashok Leyland, Smartshift by Mahindra & Mahindra, Dainik Bhaskar Group and INshorts.com on its global cloud platform, expects a India presence to service local customers faster. Google calls it data centre Cloud Region. "By expanding to new regions, we deliver higher performance to customers. In fact, our recent expansion in Oregon resulted in up to 80 per cent improvement in latency for customers," said Brian Stevens, vice-president, Google Cloud, in a statement. Google Cloud Platform takes the infrastructure, machine learning and networking services used to power Google services and makes them available to businesses and developers to build high performance applications and data analysis at a low cost. As India's start-up community continues to grow, Cloud Platform provides the full stack of services to build, test and deploy their applications, the firm said. In addition to its focus on Indian customers, Google is continuing to build its partner ecosystem to support customers as they move to the cloud. In India, Google already has deep partnerships with a multitude of born-in-the-cloud partners including Searce Co-Sourcing, Cloud Cover, PowerUp Cloud and MediaAgility as well as global partners like Wipro, TCS, Tech Mahindra, PwC and Cognizant. The opening of the Cloud Region opens up newer opportunities for several new cloud partners who will benefit from building their services on Google Cloud, the firm said.

The company is just about to release a cutting-edge new smartphone and has also made big improvements to its translation app. Like just about everything else in tech at the moment, it's using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the Google Translate app. In fact, Google reckons it's now about as good as a human translator. Read More Google Trips wants to help you plan your holiday and be your personal tour guide abroad It's using a new algorithm called the Google Machine Neural Translation, which it says cuts down errors by 80% compared to previous versions. Google Translate can also capture pictures and translate them (Photo: Google) Instead of breaking a sentence down into individual words, it reads it as a whole and checks the context against a gigantic digital dictionary stored in its memory banks. Read More Google set to launch giant internet-beaming space balloons over Indonesia That means it can often figure out new ways of arriving at a correct translation and doesn't have to be told to follow certain rules. “You don’t have to make design choices,” Mike Schuster, a Google Translate engineer told Quartz . “The system can entirely focus on translation.” Read More Google Maps finally introduces offline navigation - but not everyone will get to enjoy it Suchandrika Chakrabarti using Google as her guide in Rome. Pictured - Google Translate (Photo: Daily Mirror) At the moment, the new system is only being used to translate from English to Mandarin and vice-versa. But the search giant says it'll be rolled out to other languages in due course. The Google Translate app is available for free on both iOS and Android. Because you're able to download language dictionaries to your phone, you don't have to have an internet connection to use it.

Leading the Charge to Digital Transformation With Google Cloud By Published: Sept 30, 2016 2:09 p.m. ET Share Sep 30, 2016 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- The Tier 1 Google Cloud Partner Enables Private and Public Sector Organizations to Deploy All Aspects of G Suite MINNEAPOLIS, MN--(Marketwired - September 30, 2016) - Agosto Inc., a tier 1 premier Google Cloud partner has helped 280+ companies "Go Google" -- at state agencies, Groupon, and just about every type of business in between. So as Alphabet Inc.'s largest subsidiary embarks on a mission to rebrand its widely-adopted Google Apps for Work suite to the new name "G Suite" and Google for Work to "Google Cloud", Agosto stands poised to help even more companies leverage the public cloud. Agosto President Aric Bandy attended Google's Horizon conference, an invitation-only event, yesterday in San Francisco. "Listening to Diane Greene talk about the original promise of the Cloud, and how we are delivering that promise at an enterprise level, really resonated with me," said Bandy. "The launch of Google Cloud and G Suite is more than a name change. After ten months of acquisitions and partnerships, Google has heavily invested in product updates and infrastructure, and that's how we can make digital transformation a reality for our customers." Google Cloud is the enterprise-focused division that offers the public cloud infrastructure -- Google Cloud Platform -- as well as G Suite, enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for machine learning and enterprise mapping services. G Suite encompasses the ecosystem of apps Google has built and continues to improve upon, as well as the deeper integration with machine learning and artificial intelligence, which leads to improved work efficiencies. Team Drive shifts the focus from individual users to teams, streamlining productivity facilitating continuity of progress for projects even as roles change. Agosto has been previewing Team Drives with a small set of customers, and will begin to extend this capability to more customers through an Early Adopter Program. Agosto compiled a comprehensive list of Google's new brands to explain what has changed and what will stay the same, which can be seen here. About Agosto Founded in 2001, Agosto is a cloud services company that helps organizations leverage Google Cloud products in the private and public sectors, providing technical solutions, change management and training, custom development, migration and deployment from legacy systems, ongoing admin support, and product development. Agosto is the second largest Cloud Platform reseller globally, and was named Google Global Partner of the Year for Cloud in 2013. The company has been included in the Inc. 500 | 5000 four times. Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minn., and with offices in Toronto, Ontario, Agosto's clients include 1-800-Got-Junk?, the State of Wyoming, Unilog, Groupon, Jaguar Land Rover, and the Library of Congress, among others.

SUBSCRIBE Authority & link building with real-time Penguin Google recently released Penguin 4.0, and the Penguin filter now updates in real time. Columnist Marcus Miller explores what this means for SEO and link building. Marcus Miller on September 30, 2016 at 10:37 am More So it happened. Google finally released Penguin 4.0 — the last Penguin update of its kind, as it now processes in real time as a part of Google’s core ranking algorithm. In this post, I want to take a look at what Penguin is, how this update affects the SEO community as a whole and how the brave and the bold can continue to safely improve their organic visibility without fear of repercussions from punitive search engine algorithms. The announcement After a few weeks of turbulence in the SERPs, the announcement that many had predicted was finally made. The Penguin 4.0 announcement had two key points: Penguin is now running in real time. This is really good news. There are lots of folks out there who have paid the price for low-quality SEO yet are still not seeing a recovery after removing or disavowing all of their spammy backlinks. Certainly, a house built on dodgy links will not spring back to a position of strength simply by removing those links; however, there are many businesses out there that seem to have been carrying algorithmic boulders around their digital ankles. Hopefully, these folks can now move on, their debt to a punitive algorithm update paid in full. Penguin is now more granular. This element is a little more curious, in that Penguin 2.0 seemed to add page-level and keyword-level penalties, making it more granular than the 1.0 release. However, we can only imagine that things have got much more advanced, and possibly individual links are considered rather than the seemingly aggregate approach that was taken historically. Only time will tell the degree to which this granular approach will impact sites, but I suspect it will be a good thing for those looking to play by the rules. It will also be interesting to see how this fits in with the other 200 or so factors or “clues” that Google uses to rank websites. We now we have both Panda and Penguin integrated into Google’s core ranking algorithm (though Panda does not run in real time), so it’s possible that the weight of the various known ranking factors may have changed as a result. One other interesting nugget is that there will be no more notifications for Penguin updates. Penguin now constantly updates as Google crawls the web, so tweaks to the finer points of this system will no longer be announced. Personally, I think is a good thing — folks can concentrate on doing good marketing (and SEO) rather than nervously waiting for the hammer to fall on some overused link-building tactic. Links are still important It’s important to remember that links are still important. Google has clarified this a number of times now, with Googlers such as John Mueller, Gary Illyes and even Matt Cutts clarifying the importance of links as a ranking signal, while also often warning of the problems of focusing on just links as a marketing and SEO strategy. Of course, if we can step back a little, this makes perfect sense. If you have a simple five-page website, no corresponding social or PR noise, and 5,000 links… something does not quite add up there. Why would people cite that resource so widely? On the other hand, if you have worked hard on your site and have a hundred or so great content pieces, solid reputation signals and 500 or so editorial links with wildly varied anchor text spread across the web with no discernible pattern, then this does look a little more natural. Add on some PR and social activity, and we start to see a pattern that looks like a real business. So links are important — critically so for SEO. But links are one of many factors and should not be looked at in isolation. In fact, great links should often be the side effect of great marketing. So take off your reverse-engineering hat and put on your smart marketing hat, and you are moving in the right direction. What Google wants I always find it useful to briefly analyze Google’s recommendations. You can be sure those press releases and webmaster guideline pages are carefully worded, and often we can derive more clarification of what is needed. From the Penguin 4.0 announcement: “focus on creating amazing, compelling websites.” From the Link Schemes page: “The best way to get other sites to create high-quality, relevant links to yours is to create unique, relevant content that can naturally gain popularity in the Internet community. Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it. From the Webmaster Guidelines: “Think about what makes your website unique, valuable, or engaging. Make your website stand out from others in your field.” From the original Penguin announcement: “focus on creating amazing, compelling web sites.” This is the same statement again, so they must mean it, folks! There is a common thread here: quality. Whether it’s website quality, link quality or content quality, Google clearly wants to drive this point home. “The best way to get other sites to create high-quality, relevant links to yours is to create unique, relevant content that can naturally gain popularity in the Internet community.” That statement says it all. The only problem here is that Google is often a little (wildly?) optimistic. Creating great content often is not enough on its own. You have to let people know about it. You have to build relationships with folks who may be interested in what you have to say. You want to build relationships with other bloggers and website owners. You will then want to look at ways to use these relationships to start building the kind of links that will move the needle. High quality, in Google’s eyes, means making your site valuable to your target audience. Create something that is really, truly helpful — then let people know about it. Don’t do this the other way around and start building links in volume where there is nothing of value to link to. This, in a nutshell, is the problem with most link-building efforts — they are tackled completely back to front. Links are built before on-site value has-been created. The solution to this is simple: Start with your site. Build something of value. Then layer your link building over the top. Link building tactics The following is a brief overview of some link building tactics that still have merit and are based on the thinking above. Basic prospecting. Using a range of advanced query operators, you can often find resource pages or even (shock, horror!) highly ranking and well-maintained directories that are relevant to the product or service you provide. The more content you have on your site, the easier it becomes to find sites that are linking to similar resources and that will consider linking to you. Search for your keywords +resources, +links, +directory and other terms that indicate a relevant resource. Then do the requisite research. (More details.) Competitor research. Often, reviewing the links your competitors have will reveal some sites that will consider linking to you or your content. Again, make sure you have something of value before requesting any links — and remember that just because a site links to your competitor, it does not mean that link is helping them rank. Think quality. See some smart thoughts on how to do (and not do) competitor research the right way here. Guest post prospecting. Guest posts are a still a great way to generate exposure for your business and tap into a site’s audience. Remember, though, quality must come first. Likewise, if you have an opportunity to link to a piece of content within the body of the article and it adds value, then do it in a natural way to get an editorial vote within that article. I would tend to look for blogs in your space initially and manually review whether they have guest authors. You can also prospect, again on Google, using search strings like “Keyword” + “guest post,” “keyword” + “write for us,” “keyword” + “contributor” — I favor this approach rather than tools, as the sites returned highly are likely to be authoritative. Content + outreach. Once you have a bedrock of great content on your site, you can find sites that link to other articles and then go about contacting the owners to see if they will link to your content. Ideally, your content should improve on what they already link to so that link can be swapped out or yours can be included in addition to the original link. The Skyscraper Technique can work well here; however, it is not perfect for every situation. Broken link building. This is similar to #4 in many ways, but you are looking for broken links on sites you have identified as potentially providing a valuable link (or vote) for your business. You may well need to create some content to fill the gap when you find an opportunity, but this approach where you are helping the site owner and providing a simple alternative can yield great results. Identify sites you would like a link from, then crawl those sites with Screaming Frog or Xenu Link Sleuth to find opportunities. Lots of legwork here, but you can find diamonds in those 404s! Local organizations. With local businesses, I like links that help tie you into that physical location. Often you will be able to find clubs or some such that will accept some sponsorship in return for a safe, branded link on a page of their site. Play it safe here; do this for the right reasons, and you can generate some solid ties with local businesses, leading to more eyes on your business and some great local links. Press and PR. Further to having an amazing site, doing great things in the real world can also have benefits in getting exposure in the press and relevant publications. This will, in many cases, generate a link back to your site, again helping you build trust and relevance. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, and really, I don’t like to attempt link building from a tactics perspective without having a clear and unique strategy tailored to each business. We see tactics that deliver great results for one business completely fail to deliver for another. This game is all about determining what is right for you and adding links to your site that enrich the web and make the linking page a better place. Of course, to do this, you have to focus on ensuring your site is the very best it can possibly be so the linking site is improved by the link to yours. Final thoughts The best SEO often comes down to common sense. Spammy directory listings did not make sense. They were there purely for SEO. This backwards approach meant many sites were top-heavy with links with no content. All that time and effort spent, and no real value added to the site. I talked about the psychology and history of this in a post on my own blog called “Ass Backwards Link Building” that really dives into how search engines work, the mentality of many low-end SEO agencies and how their practices are directly out of alignment with Google’s own “give, give, give” mentality. Sure, Google shows us ads. Lots and lots of ads. But they gave us free access to the world’s information. In my mind, that is a good trade-off. Unfortunately, though, we live in a world where we have folks looking for a cheap SEO solution, and there will always be some provider who will fill that gap — the demand for cheap SEO creates cheap SEO. Around and around we go… unless, of course, Penguin 4.0 finally puts pay to risky, low-value tactics. I sincerely hope that Penguin 4.0 puts and end to the often daft link-building tactics of the past. Penguin may well need some fine-tuning, but link building in 2016 and beyond will mean tackling your website first — building something great, and then letting people know about it.

SUBSCRIBE What’s new and cool at Google from SMX East 2016 At this year's SMX East, Googlers Jerry Dischler and Babak Pahlavan shared recent updates and what's coming to AdWords and Google Analytics. Columnist Mark Traphagen was on hand to cover the highlights. Mark Traphagen on September 30, 2016 at 12:31 pm More At this year’s SMX East conference, which took place this week in New York City, Search Engine Land reporter Ginny Marvin and contributing editor Greg Sterling hosted a conversation with Google executives Jerry Dischler, the vice president of AdWords (@jdischler) and Babak Pahlavan, the global head of products and director of Google Analytics (@babakph). Dischler shared recent updates and changes to the Google AdWords platform, while Pahlavan covered the same for Google Analytics. Read on for highlights from their conversations. Left: Jerry Dischler, the vice president of AdWords. Right: Babak Pahlavan, the global head of products and director of Google Analytics. Jerry Dischler on Google AdWords updates Expanded Text Ads Dischler was asked why there has been a delay in the complete rollout of Expanded Test Ads (ETA), and how they are performing for those who already have access. He reported that advertisers already using ETA seem to getting good results. Googlers tend to be optimistic, so they took on the challenge of changing the creative framework for AdWords for the first time in 15 years. However, Dischler admitted, the changeover is not happening as smoothly as they had hoped it would. They’ve found the advertisers who are embracing ETA tend to be those who always have put great care into their optimized testing of creative, and, in general, they are seeing great results. Those who aren’t seeing results are usually just dipping their toes in the water, either not using dynamic elements or using one-size-fits-all creative. Google hopes advertisers will realize that employing the best practices they should already know will yield them more success with ETAs. Dischler said Google has decided to wait until after the holiday season to make the switch final, so users can have more time to adjust to it. If advertisers don’t immediately see a CTR increase from ETAs, Dischler suggests they try more and different things, using the same best practices as they always have. He encouraged them to keep testing and learning. With non-branded, generic ETAs, there can be big differences in performance when you optimize both parts of the headline; for branded ETAs, shorter headlines work better. Reintroduction of device bidding In late spring of this year, Google announced it would bring back the ability to bid separately by device type (desktop vs. mobile vs. tablet). When asked why Google reversed course after dropping this capability previously, Dischler said advertisers told them they had legitimately different use cases for different devices. For example, a traveler in New York looking for New York hotels on a mobile device is much closer to a buying decision, so it makes sense that an advertiser would want to bid higher on mobile vs. desktop. A few years ago, advertisers seemed mobile-averse, but they’ve made a dramatic shift to mobile-first, and they needed the tools to target appropriately. What works well for device bidding is looking at current bids first from a blended point of view, then looking at performance by device and adjusting individually up or down, according to performance. On the other hand, a demonstrated worst practice is bidding down tablets, or any other device type, without giving it due consideration. Results will differ for everyone. Look at blended first, then adjust each platform up or down. Store visits In this multi-device world, we should measure the entire ROI chain — online and offline. Ninety percent of retail sales still happen offline, for example, so tracking where online ads bring someone into a physical store is critical to measuring the full value of your ads. According to Dischler, Google finds that for many advertisers, the offline benefit of ads is actually larger than the effect online. So Google has made Store Visits available to thousands of advertisers in 14 countries and is expanding their availability. The company has expanded it from search to display as well. Its desire, Dischler says, is to be able to offer a single measurement across all Google ad platforms. One of the factors that makes Store Visits tracking work is the fact that hundreds of millions of Google users have opted in to location sharing. Google augments its data with Google Maps information, as well as input from WiFi and other signals. The company also employs human reviewers who will physically go to a location so they can tune precision. Dischler says Google is now able to pinpoint the location of a shopper with over 99-percent accuracy. Greg Sterling, Ginny Marvin and Jerry Dischler react to an audience comment at SMX East 2016. Audience targeting Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA) have been a runaway success. Some advertisers are saying it’s the biggest change in the last five years for better targeting and ROI. Larger advertisers should certainly try out RLSA, Dischler suggests, adding that advertisers will be able to manage RLSA at the campaign level in the next few weeks. Cross-device RLSA will be out this week as well, allowing targeting of users across devices. Customer Match is designed for customers whose email address you’ve collected online or offline, allowing you to target them in search by matching those addresses to users. It also can be used to create persistent customer IDs for analytics. Dischler also announced that Similar Audiences is now in open beta. This feature lets advertisers target their ads to audiences that are similar to the people they have on their lists. Demographics targeting is also going from open beta to release. It targets by age, gender and income. Asked about the methodology used to pinpoint similar audiences for search, Dischler notes that Google is currently using search history but is looking to improve it with more signals. Can you layer demographics with Similar Audiences? Not yet, he said. Local ads updates Google recently introduced a cluster of local ad features. They’re conducting lots of experiments, but the features are not yet broadly available. They’re exploring how to make online ads drive even more traffic to physical stores, with things like Promoted Pins on apps and multiple new ad formats. They’re putting lots of investment into this area. Local inventory ads are now more established. Best Buy drove over one million incremental store visits with them the last holiday season. As for ads in the Local Pack in Search, there are currently two different iterations, one in experiment and the other launched. The launched type shows up when a user expands from the Pack to a full list; the experimental type shows up before expansion. Babak Pahlavan on Google Analytics updates Google Data Studio Google Data Studio, a free version of Google Data Studio 360, is a dashboarding and reporting tool launched earlier this year. You can be up and running and reporting quickly by just connecting to data sources, instead of exporting first. Google has been focusing on a second notion of collaboration and sharing. The aim is to easily share reports in an organization, with the ability to collaborate on the information. Google launched 360 Enterprise and the free version for US users earlier this year. Data Studio is now rolling out, not only to the US, but also to a number of other countries. Greg Sterling and Ginny Marvin talked to Babak Pahlavan onstage at SMX East. Google Optimize free version Pahlavan said more free tools are coming. Optimize 360 Enterprise was announced earlier this year, but the objective is to improve measurement for all size users. Pahlavan announced a free version of Optimize at SMX East that will be available later this year. To get on the waiting list for it, go to G.co/optimize. It natively integrates into Google Analytics, and works right out of the box. Conversions and goals are easily brought into Optimize. Motley Fool said they went from days to minutes for the same analysis by implementing Optimize 360. A major gold and silver coin retailer was able to double their per-user revenue by using data from it to tailor on-site experiences for users. Smart Goals Smart Goals are for advertisers who have not set up their own goals. It uses machine learning to give them more potential conversion information. SG is helpful for e-commerce sites that don’t have much transaction data. It automatically sets up goals for them. Users actually get a preview of what performance could look like with a certain optimization. Pahlavan also announced a new session quality score that exposes more of the data from Smart Goals. The score shows a likelihood of conversion for a session, allowing you to optimize that user’s experiences and/or create targeted remarketing for them. Autotracking Autotrack library is a collection of plugins that shortcut complex setups. Designed for the developer community, they ended up becoming wildly popular. But Pahlavan sill advises more advanced customers to use Google Tag Manager. Another 20 tags are being announced for Tag Manager. He was asked: “If you already have your own custom HTML tag for a tracking purpose, should you drop it for a plugin?” Google recommends all customers switch to Tag Manager as soon as possible, as it gives more control and customization. Mobile app insight cards Insight cards in the Google Analytics mobile app leverage machine learning. They eventually will be available on desktop Analytics as well. Insights automatically analyzes your signals to call out trends you might want to know about. Google tests it with their own site that sells Google souvenirs to Googlers. Pahalvan shared that he got alerted to a site speed concern with the test site’s Indian servers that they might not have noticed for weeks on their own. Insights doesn’t use pre-defined benchmarks; it continually learns from your own data to call out what is truly interesting but previously might have been hidden in your data. Further insights from the audience Q&A AdWords Extended Test Ads are being tested in a lot of new ad formats. Why did they restrict Keyword Planner data from users without active AdWords campaigns? Dischler answered they wanted “good actors” using it while keeping out “bad actors.” He said the spend limits are low, so most account holders should be able to still get data, as well as agencies representing advertisers in most cases. There are no plans to extend Store Visits for channels outside paid search, other than the expansion to Display. Analytics Data Studio data sources will continue to expand the sources you can connect to. In October, Google will roll out templates for reports for data visualization. Five reports per account for now, but they are analyzing where more demand may exist. What about creating remarketing in AdWords vs. Analytics? Is one better than the other? You can use your Google Analytics lists in AdWords; they are complementary. There are no plans to add more ad slots in Google Search. They have to look at the space available to both expanded ads and organic results on a query-by-query basis according to intent. What is Google doing about Analytics referrer spam? Dischler said they have an active project in the works to combat such spam. They don’t share stats externally, but they do take spam seriously.

New Google Tilt Brush demo shows what it’s like to paint with friends in VR Posted Sep 30, 2016 by Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story So now we have a federal CISO One of the more fun usages of virtual reality to have already emerged is Google’s Tilt Brush. The VR painting simulator is often one of the first things I demo to first-time VR users and it really allows people to lose themselves in a VR world and make it whatever they want it to be. Art is more fun with friends, and it appears Google is discovering that as well. Today, the company is showing off a new prototype of the app that allows you to “share ideas, draw and create with others” as you design and build VR creations. Update: Tilt Brush multiplayer isn’t available yet but Google is “exploring ways to develop this concept further.” Tilt Brush is currently only available for the HTC Vive because of controller restraints on Oculus at the moment, it’s just a prototype at the moment but the team is hoping to develop it into a full-fledged feature soon. In addition to the multiplayer feature, Google’s VR team is continuing to use Tilt Brush as an experiment in building a creative platform. Tilt Brush is experimenting with some other cool features including custom avatars, so users can personalize their VR look; Portal Brush, so they can peer out into the real world using the HTC Vive’s front camera; and a few other techniques to bring animation into the VR world. Tilt Brush is constantly checking out new updates, but this is a particularly huge one given the massive potential for increasing the scale of creations and the level of collaboration. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

The company’s philosophy is that software services run better if the infrastructure underneath is built and operated by those who know software. “It turns out services run better when people who understand software also run it,” Melissa Binde, Google’s director of Site Reliability Engineering, said during a presentation at a company conference earlier this year. These Googlers are called Site Reliability Engineers, and soon, enterprise customers of the company’s cloud services will be able to embed Googlers with similar credentials on their own infrastructure teams to ensure critical applications deployed in the Google cloud run smoothly. Part of a bigger announcement about major changes and upgrades across Google’s entire cloud business – including the announcement of eight new cloud data center locations slated to come online next year – was a note about this unusual model for cloud customer support: Customer Reliability Engineering, or CRE. Read more: Google Devs Get to Run Google Infrastructure for Six Months The “Seriousness” of Google Cloud Google, which has been slow to grow its enterprise cloud business in comparison to Amazon and Microsoft, is often criticized for not being “serious” about its cloud services. One of the criticisms was that the company didn’t really know how to work with enterprise customers, which is something other major cloud players – the likes of Microsoft, VMware, and IBM – have done for many years. Starting last year, the company has been on a mission to prove those critics wrong. The first big step was hiring VMware founder Diane Greene to lead the cloud unit, and the following steps focused on investing tons of money into a global Google data center expansion to offer more cloud availability regions and improving the feature set around cloud services, including a major focus on enhancing services with machine learning. Read more: What Cloud and AI Do and Don’t Mean for Google’s Data Center Strategy “Designed to deepen our partnership with customers, CRE is comprised of Google engineers who integrate with a customer’s operations teams to share the reliability responsibilities for critical cloud applications,” Brian Stevens, VP of Google Cloud, wrote in a blog post. “This integration represents a new model in which we share and apply our nearly two decades of expertise in cloud computing as an embedded part of a customer’s organization.” Pokémon Go: a Trial by Fire Google tested the CRE model on Niantic, the company behind the popular mobile “augmented-reality” game Pokémon Go. Niantic originated at Google but was spun out last year. While some past reports have suggested that the game runs on Google’s cloud, this is the first official confirmation by Google, for whom attracting and boasting high-profile cloud customers is another major way to prove its cloud’s worth. Some might say the outage-ridden roll-out of Pokémon Go in July is not the best customer engagement to boast about, especially as part of the announcement about a new customer reliability team. The game was plagued by downtime throughout its first month on the market, players around the world frustrated by the frequently appearing message saying the game’s servers were overloaded. A separate blog post on the launch of Pokémon Go, however, indicates that the rough start was due more than anything else to the game’s unexpected popularity. The worst-case estimate of Pokémon Go traffic on Google’s cloud datastore the team prepared for was five times Niantic’s target traffic. But once the game launched, it quickly outstripped the target fifty-fold: “Throughout my career as an engineer, I’ve had a hand in numerous product launches that grew to millions of users,” Luke Stone, director of Customer Reliability Engineering, wrote in the post. “User adoption typically happens gradually over several months, with new features and architectural changes scheduled over relatively long periods of time. Never have I taken part in anything close to the growth that Google Cloud customer Niantic experienced with the launch of Pokémon Go.” Google has not provide much more detail about the new CRE program, saying only that it will have more to share about it “soon.” Previous Article Building at the Edge Next Article Amazon, Google Detail Next Round of Cloud Data Center Launches Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Sep 30, 2016 at 1:40PM Image source: Getty Images. It was just about two years ago that Google -- now Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- executive chairman Eric Schmidt told an audience in Berlin that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is Google's biggest competitor. He noted that about one-third of product searches start on Amazon, while half as many start on Google. Two years later, Google has fallen even further behind Amazon: Fifty-five percent of U.S. online consumers now begin their product searches on Amazon.com, according to a survey conducted by BloomReach and reported by Bloomberg. Just 28% use a typical web search engine of any kind. Losing the most valuable searches Product searches are the most lucrative for Google and other search engines since there's such high demand to advertise against them. If a user searches for "best umbrella," for example, it's very likely an advertisement for an umbrella will convert into a sale. Google has been working to improve its Shopping search and advertising products. It added reviews about two years ago, and has been making it easier for stores to import their product inventory. Still, it continues to fall further behind Amazon. The impact of losing high-valued search queries to Amazon isn't readily apparent in Google's operating results. Average ad prices continue to decline as a larger percentage of its ad inventory comes from mobile and YouTube, which generally carry lower ad prices compared to desktop search. Still, it's not like Google is hurting for revenue growth. Ad revenue for the Alphabet segment increased 19% overall, year over year, last quarter. The increase was 24% for its owned and operated properties. Why users are searching Amazon instead of Google The biggest reason consumers are starting their product searches on Amazon, instead of a search engine or any other online retailer, is because they plan on buying the product from Amazon. That might sound simplistic, but the fact is that Amazon's Prime subscription has become one of the most successful loyalty programs in history. As Prime membership grows, so too does the number of people beginning product searches on Amazon. It's worth noting that Amazon, as a product search engine, provides other benefits over Google and traditional search engines -- lots of reviews, good product images, and a useful pricing benchmark. But people mostly search Amazon because they know they can get free two-day shipping and the pricing will be competitive. Amazon has an estimated 49 million Prime members, according to analysts at Cowen and Company: That's approximately 44% of all U.S. households. Additionally, Prime members spend about $1,200 per year on Amazon, compared to $500 per year for non-members. Amazon certainly benefits from most shoppers starting their online product searches on its website. Not only is Amazon more likely to win a sale over its competitors, but it can also benefit from advertising on its website from third-party retailers. Last year, Amazon generated over $1 billion from non-retail activities like advertising; that's up from $836 million in 2013. As Amazon continues to take a growing share of product searches, it could find growing demand from advertisers looking to diversify away from Google and other traditional search engines. That would all just be gravy on top of increased product sales for Amazon. Amazon's dominance in product searches ought to continue as it signs up even more households for Prime. There's still plenty of room left for the loyalty program to grow, and that could come at the expense of Google's most valuable search queries.

Firstly Christian Benteke: I think it’s a fair result tonight. I think it was a great performance from the lads. We really fought hard, we came back in the game, and one points is good. It’s never easy to play against Everton, especially when they’re at home, but we showed great team spirit. And also Damien Delaney, on the free kick that led to the first goal. I thought I pulled out of it. It’s a bit harsh to be honest. Obviously we made a hash of it in the wall, the lads should have jumped but didn’t. Probably my decision. It was one of those ones that was borderline whether we should jump or not. We spoke about it and it was my call. Obviously the wrong one. And on his disallowed goal: The referee said James McArthur was down the line with the goalkeeper. I’m not sure if he was or not. It’s a bit soft if I’m honest.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.45pm EDT 16:45 86 mins: Gueye and Bolasie combine beautifully on the right flank before the former finds Coleman scampering into all sorts of space.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.40pm EDT 16:40 82 mins: My new friend Banker, who appears to have some kind of refereeing affiliation, emails about that disallowed Palace goal: “Oh lord Simon, the disallowed goal was two of the hardest situations combined for the assistant to deal with. Firstly, the player at the back stick was in an offside position when the ball was played but did not become active. I don’t think the assistant has flagged for that. Then McArthur runs close to the ball in front of the goal. Is he ‘clearly attempting to play a ball which is close to him when this action impacts on an opponent’? I don’t think the assistant can decide that. We can only hope that the officials have talked over the intercom and that Moss has used his better angle to interpret the situation. This just highlights the impossible job officials have with some offside situations.” Doesn’t it just.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.52pm EDT 15:52 Oh, actually they’re wrong. Clearly the referee thought Delaney was kicking or attempting to kick Jagielka, rather than simply engaging in dangerous play: A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences against an opponent in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force: charges jumps at kicks or attempts to kick pushes strikes or attempts to strike (including head-butt) tackles or challenges trips or attempts to trip Updated at 3.54pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.51pm EDT 15:51 “Jags handled the ball just before his face was narrowly missed but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t clearly a foul against him,” writes Banker. “The real problem is that Moss should have awarded an indirect free kick for playing in a dangerous manner. Where is Clatts when you need him eh?” On a similar theme: Preston G Foolson (@homeydawg) @Simon_Burnton not to let Delaney off the hook for almost booting Jagielka's head into Row Z, but isn't high boot/dangerous play an IFK?

Here’s the relevant part of Law 12: An indirect free kick is awarded if a player: plays in a dangerous manner impedes the progress of an opponent without any contact being made prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from the hands or kicks or attempts to kick the ball when the goalkeeper is in the process of releasing it commits any other offence, not mentioned in the Laws, for which play is stopped to caution or send off a player Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.48pm EDT 15:48 As Sky cut to ads, we hear the opening bars of the Cure’s Friday I’m in Love echo around Goodison Park.

The company is expected to show off the Pixel and Pixel XL phones, Pixel 3 laptop, Google Home, and its Operating System 'Andromeda,' and more. Here’s everything you need to know about Google’s October 4th event. Google Pixel and Pixel XL Phones Google is getting ready to release two new phones called Google Pixel and Pixel XL. The Pixel and Pixel XL will be similar, except for their size. The Pixel will have a 5-inch display, while the Pixel Xl will have a 5.5-inch display. Both phones will have Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, 12-megapixel cameras, fingerprint scanners, and great battery power. Based on the images that have leaked, both phones will have sleek aluminum and glass designs. The Pixel and The Pixel XL will have headphone jacks, according to Android Police. Both phones will start at $649, which will help them compete against some of Apple and Samsung’s top phones. The Pixel and Pixel XL will be expected to launch with Android 7.1 Nougat. There aren’t too many details about Android 7.1 Nougat’s features, but we can expect it will be good. Google Home Is Amazon Echo’s Rival Google announced Google Home back at its I/O developer conference in May, so we can expect to learn a lot more about it next week, including where you can buy it and how much it will cost. According to Android Police, Google Home will cost $129. We’re not sure of the exact release date yet, but it will most likely be in stores before shopping season. With Google Home, users can do everything from playing music, adjusting thermostats or control internet-connected lights. Though, Amazon announced its $50 Echo Dog, which is available for pre-order. Google Home can help answer questions about TV shows, sports, science, or anything else you can think of.

It’s said that Andromeda will combine both elements of Chrome OS and Android, and will be for laptops and tablets. Android Police believes Google will announce the Pixel 3 laptop codenamed “Bison” which will show off 'Andromeda.' The Pixel 3 laptop will sport a 12.3-inch screen, either an Intel m3 or Core i5 processor and will have up to 10 hours of battery life. Chromecast Ultra In addition, Google’s Chromecast Ultra could be introduced at the October 4th event. It’s said the Chromecast Ultra will support 4K and HDR and will cost $70. While the Chromecast Ultra is  more expensive than the standard Chromecast, it has some pretty awesome capabilities.

Big Data Cloud Computing Fintech Infosec Internet of Things Martech Wearable Tech Around The Cloud – Tech News For The Week Posted September 30, 2016 By CloudBuzz Around The Cloud Ars Technia has been buzzing this week about how safe the Linux kernel is, calling its current situation an “unprecedented security crisis”. Linux now underpins not only server farms but also the cloud, Android phones, Chromebooks, and everything connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). It now serves as the single point of failure that, like the first domino in a line, can send all the pieces crashing down should an exploit be discovered. Kees Cook, the head of the new Linux Kernel Self Protection Project, said “…the Linux kernel needs to deal with attacks in a manner where it actually is expecting them and actually handles gracefully in some fashion the fact that it’s being attacked.” Google is planning on showing off their latest and greatest innovations at an event in San Francisco on October 4th. We’re expecting to see new phones, new pricing and release dates for Google’s Amazon Echo competitor, a new Chromecast, and a new router. But what the internet is really buzzing about are the new Pixel and Pixel XL phones, which will be showcasing Android Nougat 7.1 and Google’s new virtual assistant app called Allo. The Verge goes in more details about the Pixel phones, as well as Google Home (the Amazon Echo competitor), Chromecast, Google Wi-Fi, and a mysterious new operating system for laptops and tablets nicknamed “Androme”. In other Google related news, TIME reported today that Google has started testing their Uber competitor, Waze Rider, in San Francisco. The Waze Rider app searches to connect riders with drivers that are already traveling in the same direction as the rider. In contrast, Uber just seeks to connect a rider with the nearest driver, disregarding where the driver is headed and requiring the driver devote themselves entirely to the rider’s interests. While this results in cheaper fares for riders, it also means lower pay for drivers. However, drivers also do not have to turn it into a part time or full time job, making Waze Rider the ideal way to earn a little money while on your way to work or running errands around town. An angry French man has won the internet today with his display of passion in an Apple store. While Apple often has received praise for their high standards in customer service, evidently this man did not agree. He entered an Apple store in Dijon yesterday and started calmly smashing Apple devices with a weighted boule metal ball (used in a French bowls game) to make his point clear, perhaps because he felt that no one was taking him seriously before. Video footage of this event can be seen at The Verge. By Jonquil McDaniel Author More Articles About CloudBuzz Daily tech news snapshots and insights from around the world...

It's less expensive than its rivals, but there's a limit to how much you can use it. by Bridget Carey 1:20 Close Drag Alphabet's Google has been quietly expanding a Waze ridesharing pilot program to more people. As of Thursday, it's available to any interested Waze users in the San Francisco area, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal (paywall). Unlike typical ridesharing services, Waze really is ridesharing: it lets people already driving somewhere connect with passengers and pick up some extra cash while doing it. It maxes out at 54 cents per mile and still seems to be limited to 2 rides per day, though. Google has been gradually rolling out Waze ridesharing to San Francisco-area users for several weeks, said the Journal. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

If you're on a budget and don't mind adjusting to Google's Chrome OS, it could be worth a shot. By: Steven Bassiri | Touchscreen Laptops in Laptops | Posted: Sep 30, 2016 5:49 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 88%Manufacturer: Acer Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Physical Overview] Page 3 [Physical Overview Continued] Page 4 [Chromebook R11 Setup and Settings] Page 5 [System Performance and Experience] Page 6 [What's Hot, What's Not & Final Thoughts] Introduction     Simply put, a Chromebook is a device that bridges the gap between tablets and notebooks. Running Google's Chrome OS and supporting a wide range of applications through Google's Play Store, the Chromebook is a less expensive alternative to a Windows-based notebook while offering a higher level of productivity than a tablet. To be clear, the Acer Chromebook R11 looks like a small notebook. It has a full QWERTY keyboard and touchpad along with an 11.6" IPS panel. The panel does support touch, and you can flip it 360 degrees and turn the Chromebook R11 into a tablet.     The biggest difference between a Chromebook and a low-cost notebook is the Chrome OS. The Chrome OS is based on the Linux kernel and offers the same applications you might download for your Android phone. These days you can do most things through your browser, and since most people already use Google Chrome on their desktop, notebook, or phone, the shift from a Windows-based OS to one based on the Chrome OS should be simple enough.   Since the Chrome OS is specifically designed to work with the Chromebook R11, it should be possible to optimize user experience.

There’s good news and bad news. Cop shoots suspect after he ‘blew doors off’ squad car in 130 mph chase N.D. Jefferson expert tells University of Virginia students to ‘man up’ Gun brought by 7-year-old goes off at St. Paul elementary school Shepard Road reopens after truck driver hits bridge, is trapped in wreckage St. Paul teacher on leave following election-related remarks Adam Johnson of St. Paul spent part of his summer schlepping around a 40-pound backpack with what looks like a disco ball perched atop it. Johnson, who works for the city’s convention and visitors bureau, was on a high-tech mission to visually document for digital posterity many of St. Paul’s off-road marvels. To accomplish this, he wore on his back a tricked-out photography apparatus called the Google Trekker. That bright-green ball positioned high above his head? It has 15 cameras pointing every which way, which allowed Johnson to photograph the St. Paul area as never before. “It was an interesting adventure,” he said. Google, the Silicon Valley-based tech giant, has been lending out Trekker photo backpacks to tourism bureaus, universities, nonprofits and other groups around the country. The Trekker loan program recently marked its third anniversary. It is a part of the company’s longtime crusade to map and photograph more and more of the Earth’s surface. Street View, a feature of the Google Maps service, is a well-known part of this quest. Those looking up locations on Google Maps can click through an endless series of overlapping 360-degree panoramas that simulate what it’s like to travel down roadways. But Google’s vast fleet of Street View cars, which roam neighborhoods around the world while taking pictures in all directions, are not designed to go off-road. So, in 2012, Google came up with the Trekker unit, initially intended for use by staffers, to carry onto hiking trails, ski slopes and other places autos cannot go. Notable places that have been photo-documented include the Grand Canyon, the Taj Mahal, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the Galapagos Islands, pedestrian paths of Venice, the Egyptian pyramids, the Colorado River rapids, the Canadian Arctic, Mount Fuji, the Eiffel Tower and the world’s tallest building, known as the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai. In another Minnesota-related Google Trekker development, Turner Sports recently shot 360-degree panoramas at Ryder Cup locale Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska. All of these places, once they’re Trekker-documented, can be navigated on the web just like roads in Street View. FINDING ST. PAUL Google recently offered a Trekker on brief loan to St. Paul’s tourism bureau, known as Visit St. Paul. Johnson said his imagination caught fire. He had to have one. After Google shipped the equipment to Visit St. Paul, Johnson and several of his colleagues spent weeks painstakingly traversing several dozen St. Paul locations as the Trekker cameras automatically took photos by the thousands. Places ranged from the small (the gardens in front of the downtown St. Paul Hotel) to the vast (the State Capitol grounds, Fort Snelling, the city’s three golf courses, the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary, Como Zoo and others). They even navigated a St. Paul segment of the Mississippi River, with the Trekker securely ensconced at a pontoon boat’s bow. There were nearly two dozen locales, in all. Internet users will soon be able to navigate the St. Paul portion of the Mighty Mississippi the same way they do roads via Google’s Street View Service. The city’s convention and visitors bureau recently used a Google Trekker photo rig to capture 360-degree panoramas of the river. (Courtesy photo: Visit St. Paul) The tourism staffers ultimately shot 4,500 “panoramics,” which are sets of photos shot by the Trekker at a single spot. These got stored on a series of hard drives, which the St. Paul shooters kept swapping out as each filled up. They controlled the rig with a Google-supplied handset connected to the camera backpack via Bluetooth. As the operator walked, the ball cameras took photos every 2.5 seconds. The sphere extends two feet above a user’s head, giving its cameras unobstructed views of their surroundings. The Trekker can run about six to eight hours on a full battery charge. Johnson said he lost track of “how many people came up to us and asked if we were playing Pokemon Go.” Hauling the photo rig was hard work. “It got heavy, Johnson said. ”We were joking when packing up the Trekker that it smelled like shoulder pads from a football practice. We donated a fair amount of sweat to the (Google) cause.” The team didn’t have to pay for the Trekker. In fact, Google paid them $500 to cover the cost of meals, permits and other incidentals, Johnson said. As of Friday, Johnson and his colleagues hadn’t seen the visual results of their arduous journeys. The panoramics on the hard drive, once shipped back to the Googleplex, were to be “stitched” together into the Street View-like panoramas. Once these are posted publicly, Visit St. Paul intends to emulate the state of Michigan and its Google Trekker site, which they said is a first-rate addition to the Pure Michigan tourism site. For Visit St. Paul, the off-road panoramas will be a great way to entice potential visitors into sealing the deal. “It’s one more way to view St. Paul, to see St. Paul in a cool way,” Johnson said. Boston, Philadelphia, Austin, Texas, Dayton, Ohio, Spokane, Wash., Columbus, Ind., and backcountry portions of Nevada, Alberta and Saskkatchewan are other locations recently immortalized by Google Trekker photography. “Local organizations and individuals know their communities and trails better than we do,” said Google spokeswoman Mara Harris, explaining why the Trekker loan program came to be. “By enabling others to take charge and collect Street View imagery of their hometowns, parks and trails, they are able to capture the things that are unique about their communities,” Harris said. This fits in nicely with Google’s overall mapping mission, she said. “The more we can enable people to contribute to the (world’s) map, the more comprehensive, useful and up to date it will be.” Tags:  St. Paul,  Technology Julio Ojeda-Zapata Julio Ojeda-Zapata covers technology for the Pioneer Press’ business and features desks.

(Image: Android Developers Blog) Google announced this week that the release of Android Wear 2.0, their next-generation smartwatch platform, would be delayed until 2017. Originally scheduled to launch this fall, Google has now decided to extend the developer preview program with the company commenting that they will use the extra time to receive more feedback on the device and perfect and fine tune the software. Instead Google has launched the third developer preview this week with extra features, including the big addition of Google Play on Android Wear. The Play Store for Android Wear 2.0 will enable users to browse recommended apps in the home view and search for apps using voice, keyboard, handwriting, and recommended queries, so they can find them more easily. Users can also manage apps more easily by updating or uninstalling them in the "My apps" view on their watch, and can switch between multiple accounts. And one of the most important features, users now no longer need to have apps both on their phone and on their watch, with the new version giving users the option to install apps only on the watch, with phone apps no longer necessary.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us New Google Maps voice commands added for a total hands-free experience By R Padla - September 30, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Summer may be over but that doesn’t mean you’d stop going on a road trip with your loved ones. You don’t have to plan a big vacation. You can always go on a short trip over the weekend to a nearby town. Pack your bags, put them all in the trunk, and drive to wherever. Make sure you have your smartphone loaded with Google Maps. It’s enough to bring you to places you’ve never been. Thank heavens for modern technology. Driving and navigation these days can be easier. You don’t have any reason now why you should be getting lost because there’s Google Maps, GPS, or Waze. We’re sure there are more related apps but one of the most useful tool is the Google Maps app that is integrated with many other apps. It’s even easier now to use because of “Ok Google”. With this feature, you can simply say a voice command and the voice assistant will do as you say. No need to tap on commands or swipe on the screen because Google Now will understand you. Voice commands aren’t always possible though. You can only use the feature if you see a white microphone icon in the top right area of your screen. The icon will become a circle with bouncing dots once it’s in use. Hands-free driving is possible with Google Maps and Google Now. You just need to make sure that things are set up properly. Click on the overflow menus (3 dots), choose ‘Settings’, and then select ‘Ok Google detection’. You can also enable ‘While driving’ so your device will follow your voice commands while in Google Maps. Simple “Ok Google” commands will bring you to your destination. If you enable ‘Always on’, the device will “listen” to you from anywhere on your device. You can say a lot of commands and Google Now will understand. Google listed possible voice search and commands on Android we all can use. With the voice feature, you can quickly say commands and find information while driving for a hands-free navigation. It’s possible. Just sign in to your Google account, enable the features and settings on your Android device, and start talking. You can ask a question or tell Google Now to do something. The app is smart enough to decipher what you’re saying. Here are some of the questions and commands you can voice out as listed down by Google: NAVIGATION “How do I get to [name of place]?” “Show me a map of [name of place].” “Mute.” or “Mute voice guidance.” “Unmute.” or “Unmute voice guidance.” “Show traffic.” or “Hide traffic.” “Show satellite.” or “Hide satellite.” “Navigate home.” or “Navigate to Starbucks.” “Show route overview.” or “Show alternate routes.” “What road is this?” “What’s my next turn?” “What’s my ETA?” “How’s traffic ahead?” or “How’s traffic to home?” “Avoid tolls.” or “Enable tolls.” “Avoid highways.” or “Enable highways.” “Avoid ferries.” or “Enable ferries.” “Exit navigation.” COMMANDS “Call Mom.” “Find gas stations.” or “Find restaurants.” “Send a text to Larry.” or “Send an SMS to Sergey, I’m feeling lucky.” “What’s the weather like?” or “How’s the weather in Seattle?” “Play some jazz.” or “Play happy birthday on Google Play Music.” “What’s the closest hotel?” “When’s my next meeting?” SOURCE: Google Maps Story Timeline OK Google app lists almost all possible voice commands  Google Maps update brings more offline options, ride service comparison Speed limit info now showing up on Google Maps, Android Auto Google Maps now has blue beam for more accurate directions Google Now is (seemingly) dead; long live Assistant TAGS Android Apps Google Google Maps google now navigation Must Read Google Home Review: Feeling at home with Google Assistant This is the Huawei Mate 9 and its Porsche Design twin Huawei Fit hands-on: fitness tracker in smartwatch clothing Stay Connected 883,798FansLike 136,413FollowersFollow 102,861FollowersFollow 469,474FollowersFollow 59,555SubscribersSubscribe About Contact Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise © 2016 Android Community - Part of R3 Media LLC

Is this just fantasy?” So, what better soundtrack for a cool new virtual reality interactive called the Bohemian Rhapsody Experience? Queen paired with Google Play and Enosis VR to create this 360-degree 3D journey, which runs on both iOS and Android. Check it out at the official site, where it can be downloaded via Google Play or at the App Store. You can also watch the interactive through Google Cardboard or as a 360-degree video on your mobile device. “It’s fully interactive, where most of the things are triggered by your gaze,” Enosis founder Vangelis Lympouridis told the Creators Project. “As you view it, a lot of things pop up in front of your eyes. You don’t necessarily feel that you trigger them, but you do. Where your attention goes, that’s where action unfolds.” Want to find out more? The above video takes fans on a behind-the-scenes tour to see how the Bohemian Rhapsody Experience was created. Audiophiles will notice something too. Dolby laboratories took the original master tapes for “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which date back to the Queen sessions for 1975’s A Night at the Opera, and gave them a sparkling new remix. “Brian May said it’s unbelievable how immersive the mix is and that we a great job,” Lympouridis added. “Having the band proclaim that the audio is superior is obviously really great.” Queen Albums Ranked Worst to Best Image of Next: Top 10 Queen Songs Filed Under: Queen Category: News SHARE TWEET EMAIL More Leave a comment EMAIL Print this page Pin it!

Google on Sept. 29 consolidated its cloud offerings under the Google Cloud banner. That brand encompasses Google Cloud Platform -- the company's public cloud -- as well as Google's machine learning technologies and APIs. Google Cloud also includes Google Apps for Work, the company's enterprise productivity suite. Google Apps for Work has been renamed G Suite as part of Google's cloud update. Google also unveiled new capabilities for its cloud lineup. Tony Safoian, president and CEO at SADA Systems, an IT service and cloud consulting company based in Los Angeles, said Google, with its cloud announcement, "makes a statement that they are the cloud. They are moving away from being a sort of upstart competitor in the old paradigm." And that's a timely statement, noted Aric Bandy, president at Agosto Inc., a cloud services company based in Minneapolis. Agosto provides services around the Google Cloud Platform and Google Apps. "Google is behind in the email collaboration space and in the cloud and have to make a lot of moves in a very short amount of time to close the gap," he said. "Google has needed to make a very public and direct proclamation that they are going to be an enterprise player," he added. "Prior to this [announcement], the market hasn't heard it." Google has needed to make a very public and direct proclamation that they are going to be an enterprise player. Aric Bandypresident, Agosto Google has some advantages as it pursues its renewed cloud push amid rivals such as Amazon Web Services. Safoian, whose company is a longtime reseller of Google Apps, said Google is "isolating the fabric of its own infrastructure capabilities" and exposing them to enterprise customers. He cited elements such as Google's Cloud Vision API for image content analysis, machine learning capabilities and containerization technology. As for the latter, Google developed Kubernetes, an open source container management system, and offers Google Container Engine within Google Cloud for running Docker containers. Safoian said Google offers enterprises cloud capabilities today that "competitors have to build from scratch." G Suite refresh G Suite, meanwhile, offers updates to components such as Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Sheets and Google Hangouts. "I'm pretty excited about the new features," said Micah Thor, president at Tech Guru, a managed service provider based in Minneapolis. Tech Guru uses Google Apps in house and has some clients that use the product. Thor cited Google Calendar's use of machine intelligence to automatically pick times on a user's calendar as benefit. "That is a time-consuming process for a lot of our clients," he said of scheduling meeting times. Thor also pointed to Google Drive, to which Google has added a Team Drives feature that lets organizations manage content ownership and sharing at the team level. Google has been previewing Team Drives and is readying an early adopter program. "It's nice to see Drive mature a little bit," Thor said, noting that the file storage offering seemed to lag behind developments on Office 365. Thor said Drive hasn't been a fit for his clients, but added that more customers may adopt Drive as Google brings it up-to-date. An updated Google Hangouts also provides customer benefits, according to Safoian. Google said Hangouts will do away with downloads and browser plug-ins and let users invite participants who don't have Google accounts. Safoian said the ability to let anonymous users or people lacking Gmail or Google accounts to collaborate in real time will let organizations turn off services such as WebEx. He said organizations that drop WebEx and similar services -- as they expand collaboration within Google Apps -- will experience "hard dollar cost savings" as a result. Google said it is previewing the new meeting capabilities and will work with more customers via an early adopter program. Cloud evolution Overall, Safoian said the G Suite update demonstrates the evolution of a product that he said had stagnated in many ways. He said the productivity suite hadn't changed much in the last three to five years. "Some of the elements demonstrated today are exactly what the partner ecosystem -- and the market -- is looking for," he said. Bandy said Google's cloud investment and leadership under Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google Cloud, can set the company on track to become a dominant cloud player in the enterprise market. "They have the cash; they have the capability," Bandy said. "All they have to have is the right leadership and the right appetite. The last couple of years, that hasn't been in place. It is here now."

The unanimous decision also addresses a question that has not yet been decided in Oklahoma’s courts: whether a reference to state law in a specific statute includes municipal ordinances. Google’s Pryor investment to reach $2 billion by 2018 Google will have spent $2 billion by 2018 building and expanding its data center in Pryor, the company said. At the heart of the new construction is a recently completed four-story building meant to help the company become more efficient in land usage and data center operations, Google Oklahoma spokesman Andrew Silvestri wrote in a press release. The building’s cost is part of an additional $1.3 billion the company has earmarked for its Oklahoma operation since the last expansion in 2012. $10 million parking proposal stuns advisory group The appearance of a $10 million agenda item in the construction of a downtown Oklahoma City parking garage surprised members of a citizen advisory committee. Rather than approve a request to commit a quarter of the contingency fund to close a funding gap in the $37 million garage adjacent to the planned Omni Hotel, the MAPS 3 Citizens Advisory Board moved the question to a subcommittee for further consideration. Auto insurance rates high, uninsured drivers to blame Severe weather is one of the biggest drivers of high insurance policy premiums in Oklahoma, according to industry data. But the bigger problem is the number of drivers who lack coverage, Deputy Insurance Commissioner Mike Rhoads said. Court reverses new ammonia rules A federal court ruling has reversed a restrictive definition of ammonia use in retail sales of fertilizer, potentially saving Oklahoma farmers thousands of dollars. The D.C. Court of Appeals ruled the Occupational Safety and Health Administration violated the Occupational Safety and Health Act last year when it issued an enforcement memorandum regarding an exemption to the Process Safety Management Standard. The original OSHA action had effectively forced retailers of anhydrous ammonia, or AA, to employ stricter handling rules, which had the effect of raising market prices. Nonprofits won’t pursue McClendon probate claims The Aubrey McClendon estate has rejected claims by two nonprofits that McClendon promised donations that were not fulfilled before he died. Neither of the charities, Boy Scouts of America’s Last Frontier Council and the Arts Council of Oklahoma City, will pursue the unfulfilled pledges in probate court, however. Weather museum completes second phase The National Weather Museum and Science Center’s storefront grand opening in Norman in September signified completion of phase two of a three-phase project. The next phase is a $70 million, 120,000-square-foot building. Besides money, museum organizers are looking for weather memorabilia. OKC trash service to get overhaul Oklahoma City’s curbside waste disposal system will begin to change in 2017 toward a more efficient consumer model by the beginning of 2018, officials said. Waste Management of Oklahoma, the local unit of the Houston-based garbage collection company, has already started working out the logistics under City Hall’s direction. OKC to pursue Omni hotel proposal for convention center By the end of the Oklahoma City Council’s discussion Tuesday, officials were raising the possibility of a fourth Metropolitan Area Projects tax to help pay for a hotel attached to the new MAPS 3 convention center. Council members ultimately voted 7-2 to direct City Hall staff to open negotiations with developers of an Omni-brand hotel downtown. 4 plaintiffs awarded $13.6M in Geismar plant explosion A Louisiana jury awarded a total of $13.6 million to four men injured in the 2013 explosion at the Williams Olefins Geismar plant. A jury in Iberville Parish ruled that the company, several plant officials and its parent company were negligent and knew with substantial certainty that the deadly fire could occur. Thousands breathe easier after court upholds DUI ruling The state’s high court will let a lower court’s decision on DUI testing stand, which could affect thousands of pending driver’s license revocations. In a 7-2 ruling, the Oklahoma Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal by the Department of Public Safety in a case originally brought by Eric Sample, who was arrested on a DUI charge almost three years ago. Sample’s attorney argued that when DPS revoked Sample’s license, the agency did not cite valid rules adopted by the Board of Tests for Alcohol and Drug Influence. Mineral owners protest SandRidge reorganization A group of mineral owners is fighting SandRidge Energy Inc.’s bankruptcy proceedings. The Oklahoma and Kansas oil and gas royalty owners argue their claims against the driller shouldn’t be discharged in bankruptcy court. The royalty owners claim SandRidge owes them about $7.5 million for improper deductions on oil and gas sales. Horse trail project needs only one thing: Money For about four years, some Oklahoma City officials and residents have been working to develop a horse trail park along the Oklahoma River. But there is no money available to make the plan a reality. New grocery store headed to northeast OKC There’s at least one new grocery store coming to Oklahoma City’s northeast corridor. Architect and developer Rick Brown said he has a letter of intent from a national grocery chain that is planning to fill 18,000 square feet at Northeast Plaza, 1148 NE 36th St. Brown could not release the store’s name. DOJ subpoenas Chesapeake documents The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Chesapeake Energy Corp. for possible antitrust violations. The agency subpoenaed documents related to how the driller pays royalty owners and accounts for oil and gas reserves. Chesapeake disclosed the subpoena in a regulatory filing. Medical marijuana question will head to voters The medical marijuana petition has survived the specter of challenge and will be on a ballot. Opponents had until Thursday to question the number of valid signatures collected on the measure, which would set a statutory framework for people to grow, sell and possess marijuana products for medicinal use. It is too late to add the question to this year’s presidential election ballot. Investor objects in McClendon probate An investment group has objected to how money from the sale of 18,000 production acres in the SCOOP/STACK play will be distributed to Aubrey McClendon’s former business partners. Wilmington Trust, a major creditor in the McClendon probate case, estimates in a court document that the estate’s designated representative, Tom Blalock, might receive nearly $3 million from the sale because of his place on an American Energy Partners executive management team. An AELP subsidiary owned and sold the land to Jones Energy for approximately $136 million.

Digital Trends learned that the Mountain View, California-based search giant intends to launch virtual reality-focused pop-up events in New York City and other locations around the world from October through December — presumably featuring hardware, peripherals, and software a part of its Daydream platform. We have confirmation now, thanks to the Made By Google website. It lists a location — 96 Spring St., New York — and an October 20 kickoff date. It’s unclear just which devices will be on hand at the pop-up event’s locations, but it’s likely we’ll see all the hardware products announced at Google’s October 4 event — Google Home, Chromecast Ultra, the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, Google Wifi, and Daydream View. Daydream View will likely be the highlight, and it will be a way for Google to showcase its new Android VR platform to the masses. Related: Everything you need to know about Google Daydream Google recently launched the Google VR SDK, a collection of tools that lets developers tap into Daydream-compatible hardware. At its launch event in San Francisco, Google said more than 50 partners will bring apps and games to the Daydream platform. One of which includes an exclusive partnership with Warner Bros. to bring a Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them narrative VR game. Daydream View. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Video will represent an outsized slice of Daydream’s launch content, thanks to partnered providers including Netflix, Hulu, Imax, HBO Now, CNN, and YouTube. Several have inked an agreement to capture footage with a 16-camera rig optimized for Google’s Jump virtual reality platform, a technology which intelligently weaves individual camera feeds into a 360-degree panorama. Game developers, too, will soon begin publishing Daydream experiences in earnest  — Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, MinorityVR, NetEast, are among a lengthy list of outfits which have pledged to support the platform. And Google will be furnish development of a few titles itself — Bloomberg reports that it will spend a “high six figures” on VR video games. Google, too, will round out Daydream’s offerings with content of its own. The search giant demoed virtual reality versions of Google Play, Google Street View, Google Play Movies, and Google Photos at its I/O developer conference. A forthcoming YouTube app, detailed in a blog post this past summer, will incorporate features such as voice search, discovery, playlists, and original content. And a VR-optimized version of the Chrome browser will ship with both VR navigational controls and support for WebVR, a Javascript API that supports VR content embedded in webpages. Google Play Movies will also begin offering 4K titles in December, ones you can watch in VR. Google announced Daydream at its I/O developer conference in May. It’s perhaps best described as a holistic mobile VR solution: It sports a “home screen,” Daydream Home, from which downloaded apps and content can be launched, and settings to ensure text, social media, and other notifications come through properly. Read More Daydream, too, is in many ways the high-end alternative to Google’s debut VR effort, Google Cardboard: while Cardboard supports both iOS and Android devices and delivers mostly low-fidelity apps and videos, Daydream targets a decidedly enthusiast market. That’s almost immediately apparent from Daydream’s controller, which resembles a Nintendo Wii remote. It sports a few hardware buttons, a trigger, and a touchpad, which serve as the primary means of navigation. Manipulating lists, moving about carousels, and even flipping virtual pancakes in Daydream is accomplished with flicks, swipes, and taps. Related: An Android and Chrome OS merger may be in the works And it’s equally apparent from the high-end hardware Daydream requires. Google hasn’t publicly revealed the platform’s requirements, but a Quad HD (2,560 by 1,440 pixels) AMOLED display, Qualcomm’s high-end Snapdragon 820 processor, and 4GB of RAM appears to be the baseline. Daydream headsets aren’t any less beefy: Meanwhile, universally feature physical controls, touch-sensitive trackpads, focus wheels, and specialized sensors. Daydream devices will compete in a field increasingly crowded by competitors. In May of this year, Samsung sold more than 300,000 units of the Gear VR virtual reality headset. And in April, the Korean company announced that the headset had surpassed more than 1 million users. google daydream pop up events nyc cardboardMore google daydream pop up events nyc alcatel vision vrMore At the IFA consumer electronics convention in Berlin this year, meanwhile, Alcatel announced the Alcatel Vision, a self-contained virtual reality headset with physical controls, a rechargeable battery, dedicated processor, and cellular connectivity. The company announced content partnerships with Magic Interactive Entertainment and audio firm Fraunhofer, and said the headset will ship with a library of over 100 VR-optimized videos and over 50 games. Even chipmaker Qualcomm is making a play at the burgeoning space. Earlier this year, it partnered with silicon firm Intel to produce a VR headset capable of spatial tracking and gesture recognition — all without external sensors or hardware. It’s shipping to Qualcomm’s partners within the next two months. The motivation among manufacturers is profit, primarily. Facebook famously bet big on the VR market two years ago, spending more than $2 billion on headset startup Oculus. And smartphone maker HTC, in June, announced a $10 billion VR venture capital initiative to spurt the creation of virtual reality games and apps. More broadly speaking, the VR industry is ripe for blockbuster profits: Market research firm IDC projects that the industry will generate more than $2 billion dollars this year on shipments of 9.6 million units. By 2020, those shipments could grow to 110 million. Article originally published in September. Updated on 10-07-2016 by Julian Chokkattu: Added official confirmation from Google.

Searching for a school or university will now show relevant data within the search page, letting you check details like graduation and acceptance rates without leaving Google. Google unveiled the new cards in a post on its recently launched company blog, The Keyword, today. It comes just in time for college application season in the U.S., a period when tens of millions of students are researching universities to attend in the next year. For most of these candidates, Google is the gateway to the education providers. Until today, the search engine has revealed very little about individual universities though, making students click through to a new page. Google now surfaces information including graduation rate, applicant acceptance rate, undergraduate tuition fees and average salary after graduation in a card on each university or school's search page. Typing "howard admissions stats" or "uc-riverside admissions stats" will show detailed information for the respective university. The card includes a map of its location and a short description of the establishment, provided by Wikipedia. Google now displays university information within search results Google The information is presented in a much clearer format than many university comparison sites provide. It's also quick and easy to access with a single Google search. The feature could cut out a lot of time spent browsing the web for university stats, helping students make their important decisions. Google is sourcing its information from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scoreboard. "By surfacing this information directly in Search, people will have access to detailed information and data as they approach decisions about higher education," said Google. "Now whether they’re looking for average tuition costs with financial aid, searching for a school with a high acceptance rate, or projecting how long it will take to pay off student loans based on average salary after graduation, Google can provide that first step into deeper research online." Google has been expanding its selection of search cards recently, helping people do more without leaving its search page. The longer it can keep users on its site the more money it makes. Adding new features such as education information helps Google to be more useful, attracting new people to the Google app on mobile and ultimately saving users time. This college application season, Google will be well-placed to serve the "hundreds of millions" of searches it receives each year related to educational institutions. Whether it's information on fees or the latest post-graduation stats, the cards will make this valuable information more accessible to the people who need it most, making the application process a little simpler.

From the revolving door of artistic doodles that grace Google’s homepage to the company’s extensive April Fools Day pranks, Google, more so than most other tech companies, likes to instill a bit of whimsy across much of its software. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Google’s homepage. Now Google’s homepage is purposefully sparse as the company wants users to quickly enter in a query and find what they’re looking for. But lurking underneath the surface are a number of awesome Easter eggs that allows users to play all sorts of interesting games right within the browser itself. Here are a few of our favorites. DON'T MISS: Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding Atari Breakout If you do a Google Image search for “Atari Breakout”, your screen will magically transform into an old-school video game console and will let you play Atari’s iconic 1972 game. Interestingly enough, the game was actually designed in-part by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Pac-Man In keeping with the old-school video game theme, you can play Pac-Man within your browser simply by doing a Google search for “Pac-Man.” From there, a Pac-Man screen will pop up and you simply need to hit “Click to Play” and you’ll be well on your way. The controls, naturally, are mapped to the arrow keys. pacman-google-easter-eggMore Roll a die Another cool Google Easter egg lets you have fun with some dice.

Credit: IDGNS More like this Oracle takes Java copyright dispute with Google to appeals court Google wins retrial over its use of Java in Android Oracle seeks $9.3 billion for Google’s use of Java in Android A federal court in California has denied Oracle another trial in its long-standing copyright infringement dispute with Google over the use of Java code in the Android operating system. A jury had cleared Google of copyright infringement in May this year, upholding the company’s stand that its use of 37 Java APIs (application programming interfaces) in its Android mobile operating system was fair use, thus denying Oracle up to US$9 billion in damages that it was seeking. A number of developers and scientists  backed Google saying that APIs, which are the specifications that let programs communicate with each other, were not copyrightable and any bid to change that would stifle innovation. The administration of President Barack Obama had in its opinion sided with Oracle and said that the APIs are copyrightable like other computer code. Oracle asked the court for a new trial on, among other grounds, the claim that Google concealed information during discovery on its plans to integrate Android apps with the Chrome OS running on desktops and laptops, thus extending the scope of the infringement beyond smartphones and tablets. District Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in an order on Tuesday denied Oracle’s request for a new trial, which would have been the third in the dispute. In 2015, Google began a new project, which it called internally as ARC++. Its aim, according to court records was to “[p]rovide Chrome OS users with Play Android apps on Chrome OS without developer action.” “ARC++ would run an isolated instance of Android (with all of Android’s public APIs, including those reimplemented from Java) in order to allow users to run all Android apps on Chrome OS devices. Google planned to include its 'Play Store' — Google’s app wherein users could purchase and download other Android apps — as part of ARC++ to facilitate access to those apps,” wrote Judge Alsup in his order. The Judge did not go along with Oracle’s claim that Google had “stonewalled and had completely concealed the ARC++ project.” Google had produced at least nine documents discussing the goals and technical details of ARC++ in 2015, at least five months before trial, wrote the judge, who added that “Oracle’s failure to review the ARC++ documents is its own fault.” Judge Alsup pointed out that the evidence on ARC++ would not have impacted the trial in May because any evidence relating to implementations of Android on devices other than smartphones and tablets fell outside its scope. “It may well be true that the use of the copyrighted APIs in ARC++ (or any other later use) will not qualify as a fair use, but that will not and does not mean that Google’s argument on transformative use as to the original uses on trial (smartphones and tablets) was improper. That Oracle failed to detect the ARC++ documents in its possession had no consequence within the defined scope of our trial,” Judge Alsup wrote. Oracle had argued in its motion for a new trial that it was a mistake to limit the devices to smartphones and tablets. Google’s launch of the full Android system on the Chrome OS is even now in its preliminary stages and available only to developers and on a limited set of devices, the Judge observed. The Judge's order also dismissed Oracle's demand for a new trial because of the exclusion of what the judge described as “minor evidence and testimony” from Stefano Mazzocchi, a member of the board of directors of the Apache Software Foundation in 2008. It also rejected Oracle’s contention that the court had improperly excluded its document containing replies to the European Commission, which had asked for an explanation of the dispute between Google and Sun Microsystems, the company that developed Java and was later acquired by Oracle. Google and Oracle could not be immediately reached for comment on the order.

Excellent interface. Smart automatic responses. Stickers, emoji, and other embellishments. Free SMS messages. Cons Not integrated with other Google messengers. Little third-party app integration. Must convince others to use it. Can't draw on images. Free SMS messages come from random numbers. No tablet or Web versions. Bottom Line Allo is the first peek at Google's concept for ambient search, where the Google Assistant adds search results to your conversations. It's a great idea, but the execution in this messaging app still needs work. By Max Eddy No one knows what the next big thing in tech will be, but I suspect that it might be machine learning-powered chatbots like the Google Assistant found in the search giant's iPhone app Allo. At its core, Allo is a chat application like most others, but the Google Assistant is intended to integrate search tools directly into the conversation. It's a revolutionary idea, but one that comes up a little short when compared with iOS 10's own Messages app. //Compare Similar Products Compare Telegram Messenger (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Signal (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Hangouts (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it WhatsApp Messenger (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Snapchat (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Duo (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Peach (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Ello (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Facebook Messenger (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it 'Ello, Allo I tested Allo on both an iPhone 6 and a Nexus 5x, and had no trouble sending messages between the two devices. Google wants everyone to get in on Allo, and makes a considerable effort to bring the new service to both platforms simultaneously. I go into great detail about Allo and what it does (and doesn't) do in the review of Allo for Android, so I'll just summarize here. It's important to understand that Allo is only for text messaging. Google's companion video chat service is Google Duo. Allo's design is typically Google, in that it uses lots of white space and pops of color. It's also very fast and responsive, with elements leaping to your touch. It's an excellent experience. The app has all the usual bells and whistles of modern chat services, including stickers, and you can also send video, audio clips, photos, and emoji with ease. Allo includes eerily human canned text responses that will allegedly sound more like you over time as the service learns. I felt oddly compelled not to use the canned responses, because they felt too much like actual speech in my testing. View All 4 Photos in Gallery There are three types of messages in Allo: standard, person-to-person messages; Incognito messages; and Group messages. Group Messages smartly let any member leave or add members, or just mute the page. I particularly like the Incognito mode, which uses the Signal protocol to secure messages with end-to-end encryption. Allo also offers an effortless system for making posts that delete themselves automatically, similar to Snapchat. If the person you want to chat with doesn't have Allo, the app will send them a SMS text message for free. That's handy, and helps make Allo more accessible. But the SMS messages, which include a nudge for the recipient to download Allo, come from what appears to be a randomly selected number. I've found recipients to be bewildered, rather than grateful, to get these messages. Allo's most unique feature is the Google Assistant. Like Siri or Cortana, it's a digital assistant designed to integrate Google's search results directly into your conversations. If, while chatting with your friend, you decide that you'd like to see a movie tonight, a colorful Google Assistant icon appears offering nearby showtimes. Tap it, and cards expand revealing your options. You can talk directly to the Google Assistant in any conversation using the @Google command. It's pretty good at parsing instructions and requests, and can even be used to clarify search results. By saying "@google closer," I narrowed a search field of restaurants from .3 miles to .2 miles, for example. You can also chat directly with the Google Assistant in a dedicated channel. Allo on iPhone For the most part, the Allo iPhone experience is identical to that on the Android app. One thing iPhone users can't do that Android users can is draw on pictures before sending them via the app. It's a very odd omission, and one I hope Google rectifies soon. The Google Assistant can help you find a movie, but if you actually want to buy tickets, you'll have to do it from Chrome. If Allo had launched back when it was announced at Google I/O in May, it would have been much more impressive, but the default messaging experience on Apple just feels more capable, since it doesn't force you to leave Messages and open another app. Just last week, I tested the new iOS 10, which includes a completely overhauled version of the default Messages app. It now includes stickers, animated effects, and third-party app integrations. This last point is critical, since you can now access apps like Fandango from within Messages. Siri, too, is able to use third-party apps to carry out tasks. Booking tickets with Fandango or sending money via Venmo are handled within the app. The Allo Assistant's ability to divine when it's appropriate to respond is, to me, more important than what it can actually do. Unfortunately, my experience was rather uneven. I said "I want to get lunch" during a test conversation with another Allo user, and the Assistant appeared but when I asked the same question a few hours later the Assistant was silent. Siri and Messages apps are always there, and always available. And while I like Allo's sticker offerings, Facebook Messenger has far more, and far more tools built in to the experience. Telegram has a completely open sticker marketplace, where anyone can host stickers they create. On the issue of security and Allo, some experts have said that Allo should have end-to-end encryption turned on by default (and not only in Incognito Mode). But Google is not alone in its approach. Facebook Messenger has a secure chat mode, similar to Allo's Incognito mode, that uses the Signal protocol to encrypt messages end-to-end. Others have pointed out that Google stores your Allo chats on its servers. The idea is to use them to better return search results and tweak other tools. Only when you delete conversations in Allo will Google remove them from its servers. Any missives sent through the Messages app from iPhone to iPhone (or to another Mac) use Apple's iMessage system. This encrypts all messages end-to-end by default, and has done such a good job that the FBI has been complaining about it for years. The Signal app also offers end-to-end encryption on the iPhone, and it works cross platform, too. Allo a No-Go? Allo is full of potential. It has an excellent design, with spiffy selection of fun features. It also offers easy sign up, encrypted private messaging, and free SMS messaging. The Google Assistant shows off the power of machine learning, as well as a new paradigm for engaging with the services and information available on the Web. Despite all that, Allo doesn't seem compelling enough to get people to sign up for yet another messaging service. Its free SMS messages are difficult for recipients to parse. And its central feature, the Google Assistant, is currently little more than dressed-up search results, and not much easier to use than Google Now. Third-party app integration is critical, and right now that's just not part of what the Google Assistant does. Finally, Allo has to compete against Google's own widely used Hangouts, which is tied directly to Google user's accounts and supports video and SMS messaging. The Android version gets a slightly higher score for its photo drawing feature, and because Allo just can't compete with iOS 10 Messages. For now, I'll continue to use Messages on my iPhone, Editors' Choice winner Facebook Messenger, and Telegram when I need to communicate outside of SMS.

The move comes amid concerns that artificial intelligence efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society. The companies “will conduct research, recommend best practices and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness and inclusivity; transparency, privacy and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability and robustness of the technology,” a statement said. Academics, nonprofit groups and specialists in policy and ethics are to be invited to join the board of the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society. Microsoft on Thursday took a step further on AI, announcing a unit devoted to “democratizing” the technology, with more than 5,000 computer scientists and engineers. Microsoft expected its new AI research group to speed up putting human-like thinking into virtual assistants, applications, services and computing infrastructures. “We are focused on empowering both people and organizations, by democratizing access to intelligence to help solve our most pressing challenges,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a release. “To do this, we are infusing AI into everything we deliver across our computing platforms and experiences.” The new unit is to include scientists from Microsoft Research, the Bing and Cortana product groups and its “ambient computing” and robotics teams. Late last year, SpaceX founder and Tesla Motors Inc CEO Elon Musk took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI, which is devoted to developing AI that will help people and not hurt them. Musk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of salvation. Google, Apple Inc, Facebook and Microsoft are among technology giants that have been investing in making machines smarter, contending the goal is to improve lives. “If we create some digital superintelligence that exceeds us in every way by a lot, it is very important that it be benign,” Musk said in June. A danger, he contended, was that highly advanced AI would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilization as a whole.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Oct 01, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Indonesia officials raid Google after tax audit refusal Bloomberg Google’s Jakarta office was raided by Indonesian authorities after they warned the company for refusing a tax audit. Officers visited Google’s office in central Jakarta “many times” over the past two weeks to collect data and repeatedly sought meetings with senior company officials, Muhammad Haniv, the head of special taxpayers at the Indonesian Ministry of Finance, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “Everyone must comply, whoever they may be,” Haniv said. “If you refuse to be audited, then we will keep chasing you,” Haniv added. The government had earlier written to the company warning it for refusing a tax audit, which can result in criminal punishment, he said. Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s government is following in the footsteps of European authorities in pushing Google to pay more taxes, as it steps up efforts to earn more revenue from Internet companies. He is under pressure to do so, as this year’s state revenue is set to suffer an estimated 218 trillion rupiah (US$16.75 billion) shortfall, while earnings from a tax amnesty program are set to miss his target. Indonesia has been asking Internet companies to set up permanent local entities for tax purposes since as early as April. It is also promising lower rates compared with the 30 percent corporate income tax and 25 percent value-added tax that would otherwise apply to Google’s sales of advertisements to local companies, Haniv said. Google has “paid all applicable taxes in Indonesia,” Google spokesman Taj Meadows said by e-mail, adding that the company is cooperating with the government. This story has been viewed 1059 times.

Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « A$AP Rocky Named Creative Director Of MTV Labs | Main | Rock And Roll Magic In The Cloud [Jack Isquith, SVP Of Slacker Radio] » What Whore Houses, Meth Labs And YouTube Have In Common [Op-ed by Maria Schneider] In this op-ed from Maria Schneider, the five-time Grammy-winning composer/bandleader explores the alarming similarities between the operations of YouTube and more conventional criminal organizations. ____________________________ Op-Ed by Maria Schneider on Music Technology Policy [Editor Charlie sez: We’re pleased to publish this guest post on YouTube written by Maria Schneider, a five-time GRAMMY-winning composer and bandleader, a board member of the Council of Music Creators, and an active supporter of MusicAnswers.org.]  By Maria Schneider OK, I know: that title really hits below the belt. I apologize. After all, it’s not fair to legal whorehouses that pay their share of taxes to lump them with meth labs and YouTube. When a nail salon or spa has a back room for illegal prostitution, we shut down the business. When a dry cleaning plant is a front for a crystal meth lab, the government comes in with guns ablazing. Businesses that cover for illegal activity get boarded up and their owners thrown in the slammer. Just because a business carries on facade of legal activity—even offering us a good value from the facade—doesn’t mean we turn a blind eye to the criminality going on. Before buying YouTube in 2006, Google execs, themselves, acknowledged the video site’s throbbing criminality by describing it as a “rogue enabler of content theft,” whose “business model is completely sustained by pirated content.” Ten years later, it is still commonly understood that a good percentage of YouTube’s music and films are, indeed, stolen content. And just like the tactics of the seedy businesses described above, YouTube has undertaken elaborate measures (much of it through its Content ID technology) to cover for endless unlawful acts that take place in its own illicit digital backroom. Before I move on—for those of you who think the three illegal activities I describe don’t carry the same weight—plant these facts in your brain: prostitution, in some forms, is legal in many places in the world, including Holland, but copyright infringement and piracy is illegal and criminal virtually everywhere. That’s right, everywhere; even in North Korea. Money Laundering: A Meth Lab often uses completely separate businesses to cover income and launder the revenue generated. Beyond the violations of drug laws involved in meth, state governments crack down on these labs because money laundering denies them tax revenue. YouTube, while not technically laundering money, has its own neat and clean, built-in way to hide and convert the income it siphons from copyrighted content, so it’s a wonder that every one of our 50 states, and cities and aren’t hopping mad. Google and YouTube facilitate the theft of billions of dollars in stolen intellectual property. It’s impossible to calculate the losses to photography, journalism, music, movies, cartoons—the list goes on and on. These creative works were bringing billions in “sales tax” into our city and state tax systems as well as contributing billions in “income tax” to state, local, and federal governments. As we’ve all seen our incomes plummet amidst the theft of our creative works, so have the amount of taxes we pay plummeted. When all the value is siphoned off our work, making someone else rich, that “someone else” must be paying the tax, right? Wrong. No one is paying that sales tax, and the vast majority of state, local, and federal income tax has vanished into thin air, too. Remember, the biggest economic value in this “free” pirating culture comes to the big data lords in the form of data, and the “value” that data creates. It’s the mountains of information about all of us that’s then turned into artificial intelligence from analytics. Their market capitalization in the hundreds-of-billions is based largely on the trade secret IP of their big data that was harvested on our backs. That market value was created with no state, local, or federal income consequences. And even if there ever is an IPO or other stock event where investors in companies like Spotify (another big data company) might be making money off this scheme, they are paying the lowest (capital gains) tax rate there is. And we all know that corporations have a whole host of tax loopholes (loopholes we regular folks don’t have) to hide the real dollars that they do make on things like ad revenue. Governments should be furious. We, the people, should be furious. Can our economy survive when, more and more, we “pay” by watching endless ads? All that tax revenue vanishes, poof. It doesn’t go back into our schools, our roads, our healthcare, our police force, into the arts, protection of our water, air, and the many things that make our society function—this untaxed fortune mushrooms in size within the secret vault of a worldwide giant that uses it to further devour us for its own gain. Through this “redistribution” of assets, they drain our cities, states and national culture of vitality. Now tell me, how is that different than an illegal whorehouse or meth lab? Their crime is actually more insidious, because it’s so well hidden amidst all the entertaining content and Google/YouTube cutesy-ness. And just like the other businesses,addiction benefits them, too. YouTube Hides the “Source” of its Music to Encourage and Protect Piracy When we view/listen to a musical work on YouTube, YouTube provides no information about if (or how) the music is licensed. It seems clear that—like any criminal enterprise—they simply don’t want us to know. YouTube’s pirated videos look exactly like legitimate videos. Even if we want to avoid pirated music on YouTube, we can’t, since YouTube hides the identity of users who upload content to their site. YouTube could easily determine a large amount of what’s illegally uploaded, as it’s painfully obvious just from reading what the uploader writes in their comments. But YouTube acts as if they don’t know and can’t know. While they make the takedown process incredibly demanding, they don’t ask even the tiniest bit of scrutiny from uploaders. We deserve better. As a culture, we place great value on the “sourcing” of our food, medicine, clothing, water, and even our coffee, demanding that they come from a trusted or sustainable source, without exploitation or criminality. But when it comes to music, we have collectively allowed these big data companies to pull the wool over our eyes and serve us up a steaming cow pie of exploitation and piracy. Enormous sums are spent by “big data” to convince the public that “piracy” is not a legitimate crisis. Like a broken record, they push propaganda messages through their surrogate affiliates, like the EFF (Electronic Freedom Frontier) and FFTF (Fight for the Future), promoting false justifications to drown out the cries of musicians, and to divert the public’s attention from their own backroom business. Their propaganda goes something like this: “Musicians want to take away your “fair use” rights! “Copyright enforcement will create a chilling effect on the internet!” “Musicians are doing fine and can just earn plenty of money from concerts and t-shirt sales.” “We pay out billions to artists!” “Copyright lasts too long anyway, so it’s OK to pirate things.” “Get over it you whining, self-entitled musicians. This is the digital age and you just have to learn to adapt.” “Music should be free.” Each of these seven justifications is preposterous. Myth 1: “Musicians want to take away your “fair use” rights!” Of the many DMCA takedowns I’ve been forced to file, not once did any user ever assert their “fair use” rights were violated, nor are they likely to, as I’ve never violated someone’s “fair use” right to my music in a takedown. I’ve actually never encountered a “fair use” of my music uploaded on YouTube. I’ve yet to meet any other musician who has ever been challenged on fair use grounds either. The massive volume of piracy violations on YouTube completely dwarfs “fair use” complaints. For YouTube to assert that wrongful takedowns of “fair use” content justify not cracking down on piracy, is beyond perverse. Fair use is an important legal concept that absolutely must be protected, but it’s completely irrelevant when it comes to full-track uploads of music. There is no “fair use” of a whole track or whole CD, especially when the YouTube video image is a still photo of the CD cover art. Despite that, YouTube refuses to accurately educate its users with the facts about full-track or full-CD use. Why? Because losing mountains of pirated work from their site would cost YouTube hundreds of millions. The lack of education on this point among users is obvious when you start doing “searches” of user upload comments. Type in, “I don’t own this,” and you’ll find endless users admitting they don’t have the rights to put something up, or type in, “fair use,” and you’ll find endless users incorrectly justifying their upload is covered by “fair use,” as if saying it’s so, makes it so. YouTube knows this, ignores it, and continues encouraging this behavior with inane and misleading “copyright education” videos. Are we to believe the most powerful analytics company in the world, one that created language translations, maps of the world, virtual reality, and is developing self-driving cars, can’t locate such blatant admissions on their own website? They can and should warn their users to take the content down or face removal of their YouTube channel. For any user who feels their “fair use” rights were violated through a wrongful “takedown,” the DMCA gives every uploader a very straight-forward way to file a “counter notice.” And when they do, YouTube is required to put the video right back up. It will then stay up, unless the copyright owner somehow (never happens) files a federal lawsuit at a cost of thousands. So even when there might be a bad “takedown,” the uploader has an immediate, free, and relatively painless way to make sure the video in question goes right back up, and stays up. Myth 2: “Copyright enforcement will create a chilling effect on the internet!” YouTube and its surrogate mouthpieces like EFF love to say that the enforcement of our constitutional copyright rights will somehow slow the growth of the internet. That’s hogwash for three reasons: 1- the internet is full of very successful legitimate services, businesses and applications that don’t depend upon stealing copyrighted work; 2- where else do we justify the criminality of a business because it somehow allows for economic growth? Just think of the historic implication of following that twisted reasoning, and imagine the world we might be living in if that logic ruled the land; 3- YouTube’s value and growth has skyrocketed at an unparalleled pace and its parent company is now the most powerful and richest company in the world. “Chilling effect” on Alphabet and Google? Are you kidding me? Myth 3: “Musicians are doing fine and can earn plenty of money from concerts and t-shirt sales.” This piece of propaganda is the most offensive and demeaning of them all. Even if it was true (which it definitely isn’t), theft should never be justified because the victim has other avenues to earn income. Let’s start with the fact that not all songwriters and composers “perform.” Add that no musician can perform continually. Remember that the touring life of a band or a musician may not be that long. But how about the principle of the matter—we don’t justify stealing apples from an orchard because the farmer can plant some other fruit in between the trees. People don’t work a lifetime to have their work ransacked by companies that aren’t inventive enough to make money except by stealing it. The irony is that many musicians “perform” at a great financial loss in order to promote their records. Now we’re told to tour just so everyone can steal our music? Myth #4: “We pay out billions to artists!” All the big streaming businesses that are gutting music creators, love to spout this misleading mantra. The figures may sound impressive in the aggregate, but they’re an illusion. A billion dollars when spread across all the music in the world, in the context of the many billions of users and trillions of “plays,” is peanuts. The simple truth is that income for independent musicians,worldwide, is plummeting across the boards, largely at the hands of one American corporation. Remember, YouTube isn’t just exploiting music from the U.S.; this American company is exploiting the entire world’s music. And the amount of YouTube ad revenue that ends up in most musicians’ pockets is mere pocket lint. It’s not even worth talking about. It’s even less than Spotify pays, and the money Spotify pays out is so horrifically low that artists again and again publicly share in disgust the amounts they’ve received. The whole streaming “model” based primarily on ad revenue is fatally flawed. It can’t ultimately work if it’s not sustainable for the people that create the music. And if it does continue, it can only happen at the peril of creative culture as a whole. Read this passionate letter to the European Commission from 20,000 of Europe’s creators. And T-Bone Burnett’s recent keynote at Americana Fest Nashville, illuminates truths about the power of art that we all need to hold at our core. Thank God artists are waking up out of our collective technology coma and are speaking out. Myth #5: “Copyright lasts too long anyway, so it’s OK to pirate things.” Nice try. First off, a philosophical disagreement should never be used as a justification for theft. Furthermore, the length of time that a copyright lasts in the U.S. is the same as in almost every major country. It’s consistent with major international treaties. But just as important, there is a long history, involving centuries of thought and major figures in literature and the arts, that justifies the length of the copyright term. The debate involves strong copyright advocates, withcompelling statements from people like Mark Twain and Victor Hugo. Copyright encourages the creation of music, literature, and art that define the very core of who we are as a culture and as a nation. This is exactly why it was written into our Constitution. There is zero justification to shorten the term of copyright in the U.S. to somehow be different from what it is in the rest of the world. Do we really respect art and culture less than North Korea? Myth #6: “Get over it you whining, self-entitled musicians. This is the digital age and you just have to learn to to adapt.” It’s amazing that we celebrate the wealth of those who made their fortune off of the digital world, like Steve Jobs and his 260­–foot yacht, yet a musician who makes significant income is demonized and told that they have enough. Why is it OK for a musician’s main asset in life, their music, representing a whole life’s work, to be distributed for free involuntarily? The internet puts almost zero copyright protection into place to the financial benefit of a host of corporate monsters, and to the benefit of a population at large that, before all of this insanity, had been perfectly happy paying for recorded music for a hundred years. These are Constitutional rights we’re talking about. For many musicians that invest in their own recordings, their music and recordings become their main asset. A good share of recordings cost the same as many folks spend on a house, with budgets going from $15,000 to $200,000 and more. Additionally, the creation of the music often requires years of work. It’s not only equivalent to investing in a home, it’s like building it, too. We wouldn’t expect we could take over someone’s home and say, “Oh, you can figure out another place to live and put your things.” And almost all recordings certainly cannot be produced for less than the cost of a new car. We don’t steal cars justifying, “Oh, you can find some other way to drive to work.” If my music files are “just digital files,” not worthy of protection, then logic follows that I should be able to similarly raid my neighbor’s Fidelity 401(k) account; after all, it’s just a digital file, too. We all know, if someone robs a house, steals a car, or illegally accesses someone’s bank account, they will (and should) go to jail. We certainly don’t say to the victim, “Oh, quit your moaning and learn to adapt!” There’s no “adapting” when assets are stolen, again and again, leaving one in debt every time one invests in one’s own work. Myth #7: “Music should just be free.” Even for someone who believes this myth, the reality is music isn’t and can never be free.  It costs those who create it everything they have—their time, training, talent, technology, and more—to bring it to the audience.  What’s more, everyone who uses YouTube, thinking how wonderful it is that all this music is available for a couple of clicks, is forgetting a crucial aspect of the transaction: they’re paying their internet or cellphone service provider—and they’re paying them a lot to gain access to all that “free.”  Furthermore, users are in the end, paying for the ads when the advertising cost is factored into the price of the products they buy, and finally, users are paying by allowing these data lords to hijack their own privacy rights, as the ads they see are based on their private activity.  And the more powerful artificial intelligence gets, the more focused the ads will get, which will push the cost of the ad more directly on to each user.  It’s a fleecing for our entire society in the end.  There’s an old saying, “If it’s too good to be true, it probably is,” and that’s certainly the case with free music.  In Closing I believe the average YouTube user would wish to respect the rights of all who make music if they fully understood the reality. If they could truly see the destruction this whole system has brought to musicians’ lives, and if they became cognizant of what it’s ultimately sucking out of their own lives, I believe they’d be horrified. They’d not only be concerned about the musicians it’s directly hurting, but they’d also be worried for music, the arts, and culture itself. The worst offense of the data lords is the manufacturing of a new culture to feed their own greed, a culture they systematically trained, an unwitting audience that’s now fully indoctrinated to expect music for “free.” The calculated effort was described by none other than Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, when he said, “Music needs to be like water. It needs to be ubiquitous.” I guess Mr. Ek thinks that water, like music, will just be there forever, no matter how much we exploit and abuse the source. The current “era” of institutional music theft will not last long. In 30 years, society will look back on this era with embarrassment and disbelief. We all know it’s wrong. Our justifications for allowing “piracy” to fuel the most powerful company in the world are as poor as they were for allowing big companies to illegally pollute or to abuse worker’s rights. It’s time we demand more from these big data corporations. It’s time, we as a culture, force them to step out of the shadows, own up to their abuses, and convert to being legitimate businesses that employ every available measure to uphold the constitutional rights of creators, and assure users that the music hosted on their sites is there lawfully. ______________________________________ Are you a performer, songwriter, composer, producer, or fan, who wants to to help protect the future of music?  Sign on at musicanswers.org.

Home CSC.com CSC Blogs Applications Big Data Business Cloud Cybersecurity Mobility Workplace November 18, 2016 Google gets its cloud together September 30, 2016 by Cloudy Weather 3 Comments Confused by what was what with Google’s various cloud offerings? Join the club! We were all members. Now, Google is integrating its offerings under one brand: Google Cloud. According to Google, Google Cloud includes all of Google Cloud Platform (GCP); its user-facing collaboration and productivity applications, renamed G Suite; all its machine learning tools and application programming interfaces (APIs), the enterprise maps APIs; and the Android phones, tablets and Chromebooks. Why is Google doing this? Insiders tell me it’s because Diane Greene, Google cloud chief and founder and former CEO of VMware, has finally succeeded in her goal of pulling together Google’s disparate cloud projects under one cloud umbrella The name makes it official. A large part of this is Greene’s desire to make the Google Cloud offerings first and foremost about the enterprise. As TechCrunch‘s Ron Miller wrote, “[O]ne of the reasons for this single Google Cloud view was her experience at VMware, where they valued integrated execution across the company. She felt that in order for this to work well, all these cloud pieces had to be working in sync with a consistent message up and down the entire cloud stack.” Specifically, Greene said, the new “Google Cloud has been engineered in an enterprise appropriate way, with integrated systems that include guarantees at the service level — all components integrated and meeting the service level agreement (SLA) for whatever price point the customer chooses.” The new Google Cloud isn’t just for the Enterprise with a capital E. Google states that “Google Cloud products are for customers of all sizes, from the self-employed and startups all the way to the world’s largest enterprises, including Google itself.” One of the ways Google is doing that is by expanding the reach of the Google Cloud Platform, its Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering. Google announced eight new Google Cloud Regions — Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland and Frankfurt — and more regions will be announced next year. The net result? Better latency for you, the customer, no matter where your offices are located. At the same time, Google has improved its container DevOps tools, Kubernetes 1.4. With the latest Kubenetes and Google Container Engine (GKE), 1.4 will gain improved cluster monitoring, one-click cluster spin-up, improved security, integration with Cluster Federation and support for the new Google Container-VM image (GCI). Finally, there’s G Suite, the renamed Google Apps for Work. G Suite is a set of intelligent apps — Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Hangouts and more — designed to bring people together, with real-time collaboration capability built in from the start. Put it all together and what do you get? Google putting its money and resources behind the goal of becoming the top cloud player. Look out Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google is coming your way.

The numbers are quite impressive in light of the data collection and privacy concerns surrounding the smart messaging app from Google.  ( Google Blog ) Advertisement The latest "smart" messaging app from Google dubbed Allo is finding favor with Android users and has notched up a whopping 5 million downloads on the Play Store in just a week since it was made available. The 5 million downloads for Allo is only for Android, which if combined with the installations for iOS could result in a higher number. Earlier on Sept. 24, we reported that Google's Allo app had hit the milestone of 1 million downloads in the Google Play Store as users hurried to download the latest messaging app with nifty features despite privacy concerns. The milestone made Allo a part of the million downloads club, joining the ranks of video messaging app Google Duo, which was released in August and has raked in over 10 million downloads. The popularity of Allo is evidenced by the fact that it was the top free Android application in the United States over the last weekend. Five million installations in barely a week of release is impressive to say the least and could perhaps be a sign of good things to come. However, the million dollar question is: can Allo sustain this growth or the spike in downloads is just a flash in the pan? The fact that Allo ranked number one in the Top Charts on the Play Store five days ago —and is now sitting pretty at number eight— is reflective of the fact that perhaps it was anticipation and excitement for the messaging app that fueled users to download the smart messaging mobile app. Interestingly, the fast growth and declining interest pattern for Allo is comparable to that of Google Duo. When the video messaging app from google launched, it quickly captured the number one spot in just two days of the rollout. In a matter of nine days, Google Duo had amassed 5 million downloads. Allo, on the other hand, also took two days to climb to the number one rank on the Play Store. However, it reached the magical 5 million downloads mark in seven days instead of nine. If this trend is anything to go on, then by the time Allo attains 10 million downloads like Google Duo, it would have slipped to number 127 on the Top Charts. While users may be pleased with Google Assistant's inclusion in Allo, making it a smarter messaging app, the privacy concerns (as highlighted by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden) could overshadow its popularity in the long term. Moreover, considering Allo is already number eight on the Top Charts in five days, the future doesn't look too bright for the Google messaging app. If you wish to add to the five million downloads, you can get Allo from the Play Store.

The release includes improved performance, a revised user interface and expanded support for cellular connections but has been delayed for testing. Android Wear 2.0 was announced alongside Android 7.0 "Nougat" at Google I/O earlier this year. The company said Wear 2.0 would launch "this fall," a vague window implying the last quarter of the year. Google has now decided against the original plan though, opting instead for "early 2017." In a development blog post, it said it has decided to extend the current preview program into the new year. It suggests Google is still testing the updated software, fixing bugs and tweaking issues. The company thanked developers for their feedback so far. Google also announced several more features coming with Wear 2.0. It released the third developer preview of the software, bringing with it a version of the Play Store designed for smartwatches. Users can browse recommended apps from the home screen. It is possible to search for apps using recommended queries or keyboard, voice and handwriting inputs. Play Store for Android Wear includes support for multiple accounts and the ability to opt into and out of alpha and beta tests. Apps can be managed directly from the watch, allowing users to update or uninstall them without using their phone. In Android Wear 2.0, apps will be entirely decoupled from their phone counterparts. It's now possible to install an app to just the watch, a regular request from users. Google said it has brought the Play Store directly to smartwatches in response to feedback from developers and customers. It ran studies that found users "repeatedly looked for and asked for" a way to find and install new apps on their watch, without having to head to their phone. Android Wear 2.0 will make this possible. The third developer preview includes a few other tweaks and changes. There's now support for Smart Reply when responding to a message notification. It generates replies using an intelligent on-watch machine learning model, letting users send a response with a single tap. Additionally, Android Wear has a new interface component that makes it easier for developers to display vertical lists of information. The features join those present in the existing developer preview builds. Android Wear 2.0 is the most significant update to the wearable platform since it launched in 2014. It has integrated messaging, more watch faces and an onscreen keyboard for the first time. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections are handled in a new way, enabling apps to directly interact with them, and the entire OS has been sped up by storing apps on the watch rather than on a paired phone. The update is still in development while Google finishes off the last few features and improves the existing ones. The company said Developer Preview 4 will arrive before the public release, suggesting it still has more to reveal.

Niantic's Pokemon Go had a very rough launch in July as the viral popularity was not anticipated. Now the Google Cloud team gives some insights what happened in the background. In the first days of Pokemon Go server downtimes and failed login attempts have been part of the life as a Pokemon trainer. Niantic even had to cripple the app to get to the point the servers can stabilize and allow Niantic to expand into more countries. The server stability was such a big issue that the community build tools to check if the servers are up or not.  Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals A blog post by a member of the Google Cloud team paints a heroic picture of how Niantic and Google Cloud developers managed to keep the service up during the launch. The key problem was the dramatic and unexpected amount of traffic Pokemon Go was driving. When planning the cloud resources Niantic and Google Cloud put the worst case traffic at 5x the anticipated traffic. The teams got to confronted with 50 times the estimated traffic. Now clearly 50x is a huge factor. On the other hand this is Google. I understand that scaling a cloud infrastructure by big factor takes time, but it took about two weeks until Pokemon Go servers settled to deliver near 100% uptime. The blog post gives some insight in what has caused the instability, but does not cover all issues. There was more to it than just scaling the server resources. The application logic for Pokemon Go runs on Google Container Engine (GKE) powered by the open source Kubernetes project. Google Cloud and Niantic engineers had upgrade to a newer version of Google Container Engine that would allow for more than a thousand additional nodes to be added to its container cluster, in preparation for the launch in Japan.  Pokemon Go was the largest Kubernetes deployment on Google Container Engine ever. Due to the scale of the cluster and accompanying throughput, a multitude of bugs were identified, fixed and merged into the open source project. Niantic and Google engineers also replaced the Network Load Balancer, deploying the newer and more sophisticated HTTP/S Load Balancer in its place. The HTTP/S Load Balancer is a global system tailored for HTTPS traffic, offering far more control, faster connections to users and higher throughput overall. Since the launch in Japan, Pokemon Go servers have been up for the most time. A DDOS attack on July 18 has knocked out the service, but since then there are no reports that hackers have been able to take Pokemon Go down despite threats. Pokemon Go appears to have a state-of-the-art architecture that will be a solid basis for going forward. Why it takes Niantic now that long to bring back Pokemon tracking is unclear. Now the question is if the Google Cloud can make Pokemon Go also secure. It is actually essential for Google Cloud that the upcoming new encryption is holding up against the 3rd party developers. The blog post by Luke Stone, Director of Customer Reliability Engineering has not too many technical insights, but gives some idea of what has been going on behind the scenes during the massive launch of Pokemon Go.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Editorials Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Editorials Sat, Oct 01, 2016 - Page 9　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Reluctance to invest in security created conditions for Yahoo hack By Nicole Perlroth and Vindu Goel  /  NY Times News Service, SAN FRANCISCO Six years ago, Yahoo’s computer systems and customer e-mail accounts were penetrated by Chinese military hackers. Google and a number of other technology companies were also hit. Google cofounder Sergey Brin regarded the attack on his company’s systems as a personal affront and responded by making security a top corporate priority. Google hired hundreds of security engineers with six-figure signing bonuses, invested hundreds of millions of US dollars in security infrastructure and adopted a new internal motto, “Never again,” to signal that it would never again allow anyone — be they spies or criminals — to hack into Google customers’ accounts. Yahoo, on the other hand, was slower to invest in the kinds of defenses necessary to thwart sophisticated hackers that are now considered standard in Silicon Valley, according to a half-dozen current and former company employees who participated in security discussions, but agreed to describe them only on the condition of anonymity. When Marissa Mayer took over as chief executive officer of the flailing company in mid-2012, security was one of many problems she inherited. With so many competing priorities, she emphasized creating a cleaner look for services like Yahoo Mail and developing new products over making security improvements, the Yahoo employees said. The “Paranoids,” the internal name for Yahoo’s security team, often clashed with other parts of the business over security costs, and their requests were often overridden because of concerns that the inconvenience of added protection would make people stop using the company’s products. However, Yahoo’s choices had consequences, resulting in a series of embarrassing security failures over the past four years. Last week, the company disclosed that hackers backed by what it believed was an unnamed foreign government stole the credentials of 500 million users in a breach that went undetected for two years. It was the biggest known intrusion into one company’s network, and the episode is now under investigation by both Yahoo and the FBI. Certainly, many big companies have struggled with cyberattacks in recent years. However, Yahoo’s security efforts appear to have fallen short, in particular, when compared with those of banks and other big tech companies. To make computer systems more secure, a company often has to make its products slower and more difficult to use. It was a trade-off Yahoo’s leadership was often unwilling to make. In defense of Yahoo’s security, a company spokeswoman, Suzanne Philion, said that the company spent US$10 million on encryption technology in early 2014, and that its investment in security initiatives would increase by 60 percent from last year to this year. “At Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure,” she said. The breach disclosed last week is the latest black eye for Mayer, whose failed turnaround effort resulted in Yahoo’s agreement in July to sell its core operations to Verizon for US$4.8 billion. It is unclear whether the episode will affect the sale. Although Yahoo’s e-mail users are its most loyal and frequent customers, the company has been losing market share in e-mail for years. “Yahoo is already suffering. I don’t think they’ll suffer more because of this,” said Avivah Litan, a security analyst with the research firm Gartner. 1 2 3 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1528 times.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Mobile World FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Allo Developer Lists 7 Most Requested Features, Including SMS Support GO Another requested feature is Duo integration Sep 30, 2016 16:19 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google released its latest application, Allo, earlier this month and it wasn't that well received by critics, although its number of downloads on the Play Store continues to increase. The app surpassed the 5 million downloads mark a few days ago, but its rating is lower than Duo's at 4.2 stars for the chat app, compared to 4.4 stars for the video calling application. A quick glimpse at the user reviews in the Play Store reveals that many users wish the application had more features, like Google voice support and SMS support. According to Phone Arena, Justin Uberti, a Google developer working on Allo, put together a list of received suggestions for features to be integrated into the app. The list contains 7 items, the first of which is Assistant features. Allo comes with Google Assistant integration, which provides users with suggestions of replies, even to photos. While the feature is truly useful and helps users come up with replies more easily, it did cause some concerns. Users requested quick replies, file sharing and themes Back in May, when Google first announced Allo, the company said that messages wouldn't be stored on the company's servers, but Assistant needs as much information as it can get in order to function at optimal parameters. Instead, Google provided an Incognito mode with end-to-end encryption for messages, just like WhatsApp's default feature. The second item on the list is a desktop Allo application, followed by Duo integration and file sharing. In addition, users requested quick replies, SMS support and additional themes that they would apply. There surely are more suggestions that didn't make the list, as Justin Uberti mentioned that he condensed the list to fit a single tweet. It's unclear at this point whether Google will actually start working on these features and integrate them in an Allo update, so we'll just have to wait and see.

Expected to go live in 2017, the India cloud region is aimed at offering Google Cloud Platform services to Indian developers and enterprise customers. The local region will help make Google Cloud Platform services even faster for Indian customers, enhancing differentiators that are already motivating companies to choose Google as their partner. With more than 1 billion end users, Google Cloud has gained significant traction in India and across the world. Brian Stevens, Vice-President of Google Cloud, said:“By expanding to new regions, we deliver higher performance to customers. In fact, our recent expansion in Oregon resulted in up to 80 per cent improvement in latency for customers.” Google Cloud is a portfolio of products, technologies, and services that let customers operate in a digital world. It takes the infrastructure, machine learning and networking services used to power Google services and makes them available to businesses and developers to build applications and data analysis. As India’s start-up community continues to grow, Cloud Platform provides the full stack of services to build, test and deploy their applications.

(CBC) Related Stories California Sandwiches employee distraught Google won't remove offensive review A restaurant review that complained about the appearance of a female employee's face has been removed by Google after her co-workers brought their story to CBC.  California Sandwiches employee distraught Google won't remove offensive review Workers at California Sandwiches, located at 3701 Chesswood Dr., contacted CBC frustrated by a Google review they say crossed the line and amounted to a personal attack on Carmella Ciccone, a beloved 20-year employee.  The review was posted last week by someone identifying himself as Jeff Chambers. In addition to complaining about a steak sandwich, the reviewer also said the worker who served him had a "very nauseating face." Those comments prompted Christopher Bernaudo, who works with Ciccone and describes her as "practically like another mother," to convince the tech giant to remove the post.  Bernaudo cited Google guidelines that prohibit "reviews that represent personal attacks on others." Although the review didn't mention Ciccone by name, employees of the popular Italian-style sandwich shop said anyone who knows her, including regulars and other employees, would know who the review was about.  One day after CBC's Stephanie Matteis wrote the story, Google contacted the shop to tell them the review had been taken down.  "I want to thank you and CBC for feeling that the issue was something that needed attention," wrote Bernaudo in an email sent to CBC this morning. "I'm happy progress was made thanks to you, but very disappointed that these were the measures that needed to be taking just to do what was right and just." Carmella Ciccone says an online review has a personal attack on her. A coworker has unsuccessfully contacted Google to get it removed.

Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager for Anglophone West Africa, made the disclosure in Lagos on Friday. He said that information about the suspicious online financial scheme had relevance for Nigerians. Kola-Ogunlade said that many Zimbabweans were obviously wishing they could turn back the hand of the clock after losing their money on a popular online pyramid Ponzi scheme. He said the information was particularly relevant to Nigeria as the scheme had already surfaced in the country and was receiving good attention. “The Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox (MMM) Global Zimbabwe is a scheme that advertises itself as a mutual aid fund with a promised monthly investment returns of 30 per cent. “Under the scheme, members contribute money to assist others. However, it is a network that relies on growing numbers of new members to pay off the old. “It is linked to a fraudulent history that goes as far back as 1989. “This scheme is currently in Nigeria and it is called MMM Federal Republic of Nigeria. The business has started to receive attention from Nigerians. “On another day, there was another hoax in which some pranksters decided that the best way to honour number one Nigerian billionaire and Africa’s richest man in 2015 was to declare him dead.’’ Kola-Ogunlade said that the news of the billionaire Dangote dying in Germany after a short illness went viral on social media and was followed by emotions, including shock and surprise. “But hey! Dangote had this to say via Twitter, ‘I am hale, hearty and alive’, Kola-Ogunlade added. “People’s attention online was also captured by Google coming officially of age in some countries of course (and without rite of passage). “Now that Google is 18, it can vote, buy alcohol, cigarettes and do other grown-up stuff. “Google celebrated its ‘maturity’ on Sept. 27 with a special doodle displayed on its homepage around the world. “Although Google’s birthday has been marked on Sept. 27 for the past 10 years, it has not always been so, as history has it that Google.com was registered on Sept. 15, 1997 and incorporated on Sept. 4, 1998. “Furthermore, Google celebrated 2003 on Sept. 8; 2004 on Sept. 7; and 2005 on Sept. 26,’’ the Google spokesman explained. He said that the Mexican Peso reacted with a rise, in what would be the first in a series of presidential debates between U.S. presidential candidates Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. “Anxious viewers watched a demonstration of raw energy as the candidates argued over race, terrorism and jobs. “The debate was also a battle of emotional constraint, which saw Clinton wearing calm to force Trump into a defensive while the internet has been agog with who won the debate,’’ Kola-Ogunlade said. The Google manager said that passion moved Okiemute Ighorodje, former band lead singer and model, who had gone on to win N5 million and a brand new SUV in MTN Project Fame Season 9. “The 25-year-old graduate, with her contagious smile, emerged as a winner in the event, after an eight-week musical competition between commendable contestants. “Elizabeth emerged first runner-up, while Kitay was the second runner-up, each taking home a saloon car with N3 million and N2 million, respectively.” Kola-Ogunlade said that a much-loved series premier, Empire Season 3 was backed with fans (and perhaps the cast) already anxious for the next episodes. “Picking off where Season 2 left off, the cliffhanger scene between Rhonda and Anika — fans who were eager to know who fell off the building discover it is Rhonda. “But will that mean fans will not get to see her character anymore? “Another highlight Empire fans can look forward to is ‘Kitty’, a mega-superstar played by guest star, Mariah Carey, who is close friends with Cookie Lyon in the series,” the Google manager stated. Google Trends, launched in May 2006 allows one to see how popular search terms and their demography have been over time on the search engine.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A You May Be Overlooking the Most Powerful Marketing Tool at Your Disposal by Matt Press  |   September 30, 2016  |  1,971 views Tweet Kindle Email Top The meta descriptions for your Web content could be just about the most powerful marketing tool at your disposal. You're almost certainly underusing meta descriptions, yet they won't cost you a thing. Let me explain... As a savvy marketer, you know how important SEO is. You're aware that ranking highly for commercially valuable keywords is crucial to the digital health of your business. However, the human element of SEO often gets overlooked. The fact is that we need to tailor our marketing strategies for people as well as machines. The trouble with SEO is that it's sometimes easy to focus too much on the techie side of things. And as it turns out, there are a lot of traditional marketing techniques that we can apply to an SEO action plan. The Case With Google For example, Google requires us to have good sales skills. The company recently revealed that it uses click-through rates as a ranking factor in searches. It's now no longer enough just to get your business to page one. Now, you also must show that you're a popular search result when you get there. Let's say that you rank in fifth position on page one for a certain keyword. Google will monitor how many people click on your page. If your Web page hoovers up a lot of clicks, Google will probably bump your page up the search results. The reverse is true. If no one clicks on your page, your ranking is likely to drop like a stone. (And, if it gets an appropriate level of clicks in relation to the other pages on the SERP, it'll probably stay where it is.) From a strategic point of view, this approach makes total sense for Google. After all, it's Google's job to deliver the most suitable search results. A CTR can really tell Google a lot about how relevant your content is. Remember, reaching page one of Google is only part of any ongoing digital marketing battle—that won't translate into profit on its own. The Importance of Excellent Meta Descriptions You need good meta descriptions for the next phase. For your SEO to be successful, you need people to head to your website and learn about your brand. Meta descriptions are marketing ammunition. They're powerful sales weapons. It's been hard enough to get your site in front of eyeballs, so now you've got to ensure that you clinch the deal. So, the question is, how do you write a good meta description? Well, at the moment, you've only got about 160 characters to play with. That's not a lot of room, so you'll have to make your point quickly. The only rule is that, from an SEO point of view, all your meta descriptions should be unique. Here are a few techniques that some of the biggest brands in the world use. Meta descriptions should... Include a latest offer or discount Reaffirm a brand promise or slogan Tease in readers with some sort of clever hook Include contact details (so users don't have to click on any links after making their search) Include fun facts about their product or service (to stand out from the crowd) Mention a free download or lead magnet (that will appeal to their target audience) Include a relevant keyword (not for SEO gains but to reassure searchers) Allude to a popular pain point that their company's product or service helps with (creating desire) There are endless possibilities with your meta descriptions. There's no right or wrong answer; the trick is to test different methods and measure the results. Ultimately, put yourself in your customers' shoes. If you were looking for a particular product or service online, what would convince you to click? And if you're still to be convinced about the importance of meta descriptions, just consider how many people use PPC ads. Businesses and agencies agonize over the copy for PPC ads because they need searchers to click on the website in question. Searches must click through or the campaign fails. It's as simple as that. The meta descriptions for organic results are no different. And in fact, because people have a real trust issue with sponsored ads, the descriptions for natural search results take on greater significance. Meta descriptions are your one and only chance to convince people that you're their best option. The rest of your SEO strategy is clearly working. Now, it's time to tick that final box. Meta descriptions are the one true crossover between traditional marketing and modern SEO. So embrace the human element of SEO and let everyone know the value of your web page. Don't give Google a chance to nullify any of your SEO gains. As powerful as SEO is, you still need to market your business before you've sold anything. The little details matter.

Anyone in the San Francisco area can now hail a ride through the Waze app. Google expands Waze ridesharing to all in San Francisco 0 Share: Auto Tech by Lori Grunin September 30, 2016 8:18 AM PDT @LoriGrunin Up Next Jaguar's electric I-Pace concept will land at dealerships in 2018 Google takes on Uber with its own cheaper ridesharing app Waze Rider is expanding as an alternative to Uber and Lyft. It's less expensive than its rivals, but there's a limit to how much you can use it. by Bridget Carey 1:20 Close Drag Alphabet's Google has been quietly expanding a Waze ridesharing pilot program to more people. As of Thursday, it's available to any interested Waze users in the San Francisco area, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal (paywall). Unlike typical ridesharing services, Waze really is ridesharing: it lets people already driving somewhere connect with passengers and pick up some extra cash while doing it. It maxes out at 54 cents per mile and still seems to be limited to 2 rides per day, though. Google has been gradually rolling out Waze ridesharing to San Francisco-area users for several weeks, said the Journal. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Partnership on AI, formally unveiled Wednesday, includes Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, Google and its 2014 acquisition DeepMind. Each company is investing untold billions of dollars in developing AI technologies, betting on a future defined by computer systems that can perceive, reason, advise, and decide. (Microsoft, meanwhile, announced a new 5,000-person group Thursday dedicated to the development of AI technologies and products that use them. Harry Shum, an executive vice president in charge of Microsoft’s Technology and Research group, is heading the new unit, called the Microsoft AI and Research Group.) Setting aside the profit motives of the founding companies—which pledged an undisclosed sum to support this effort for multiple years—the partnership is being designed as a “fiercely independent” nonprofit organization that will balance its board of directors with non-corporate representatives from the worlds of policy, law, science, and society, says Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft technical fellow and director of the research lab at its Redmond, WA, headquarters, and co-chair of the partnership. (Horvitz, is pictured above at left with founding members of the partnership, Francesca Rossi, IBM; Yann LeCun, Facebook; and Mustafa Suleyman, Google/DeepMind. Not pictured is Ralf Herbrich, Amazon.) The goal is to create an open platform that deliberates in public, includes views from a broad range of stakeholders, supports unbiased research, and develops a set of best practices for developing and implementing AI technologies. The partnership comes as public interest in artificial intelligence reaches levels unprecedented in the 60-year history of the field. In a recently published paper, Horvitz and Stanford computer science PhD student Ethan Fast analyzed the last 30 years of articles about artificial intelligence in the New York Times. “General interest, awareness, and discussion about AI has waxed and waned since the field was founded in 1956,” they write (PDF). “We find that discussion of AI has increased sharply since 2009, and that these discussions have been consistently more optimistic than pessimistic. However, when we examine specific concerns, we find that worries of loss of control of AI, ethical concerns for AI, and the negative impact of AI on work have grown in recent years.” Horvitz says 2009 was an important year in the advancement of machine learning technologies. Also around that time, Horvitz, then the president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, organized a study where AI researchers assessed the likelihood of artificial “super-intelligence,” the results of which were covered on the front page of the Times. “We have been at an inflection point in the fielding of AI technologies for the last five-to-seven years in terms of large amounts of data becoming available, computational resources becoming much more powerful, and our algorithms keeping up, and getting refined,” Horvitz says in an interview with Xconomy. As the technology has advanced, so has the competitive landscape. “The company that has slighter better algorithms to do X, Y, or Z gets a lot more attention and eyeballs, and that actually is fuel for the AI industry to work harder and better and faster at these systems that can classify and recognize patterns more quickly and more accurately,” he says. But research into the social and ethical implications of this technology and business surge—and appropriate practices to mitigate potential harm—has not kept pace. That’s part of the impetus for the Partnership on AI, Horvitz says. “For example, we’re seeing signs now of algorithms that are … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Benjamin Romano is editor of Xconomy Seattle.

"This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE. Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors, Nissan and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars. However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020. At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise. Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analyzing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters.

China may be stockpiling more oil than anyone realized The Washington Post 9/30/2016 Steven Mufson © Orbital Insight/ satellite imagery: DigitalGlobe/Orbital Insight/ satellite imagery: DigitalGlobe Orbital Insight uses algorithms to calculate how much oil is in tanks by examining roofs, which rise and fall depending on how much oil is being stored. One of the mysteries of the oil market is the question of how much crude oil China has squirreled away in commercial and strategic stockpiles. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN ▼ 404.56 -15.52 -3.69% Sanofi SA SNYNF ▼ 81.85 -0.95 -1.15% SolarCity Corp SCTY ▲ 20.40 +0.58 +2.90% Now a satellite-imaging firm called Orbital Insight claims to have an answer. It says Chinese inventories in May stood at 600 million barrels, substantially more than commonly thought and nearly as much as the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Chinese storage capacity, which includes working inventory, is four times widely used estimates, Orbital Insight says, adding that the firm has not only counted storage tanks but has also used imaging techniques to figure out how much oil is in the tanks. The issue could influence expectations in oil markets. If China has built larger reserves than previously estimated, that means much of what looked like oil demand over the past couple of years was not a result of higher consumption but of strategic planning. It would make OPEC’s task of cutting output to drive up prices­ more difficult. And it could provide a buffer for China in the event of a sudden disruption in imported supplies. The new estimate comes from a firm founded by James Crawford, who formerly worked on Google’s book-scanning project. Crawford said that he recruited some NASA scientists and left Google to start Orbital Insight because the price of Earth-orbiting hardware was falling and the amount of satellite images was booming. He has received backing from the investment firms Sequoia and Google Ventures. The firm pays a percentage of its revenue to satellite-image providers. “The broad vision is to take large volumes of satellite imagery and make sense of what we’re doing on the Earth and what we’re doing to the Earth,” Crawford said. For its Chinese analysis, Crawford said the firm went back to images taken from 2010 to 2014 and counted the number of oil storage tanks built and destroyed and came up with a figure of 2,100 storage tanks, far more than the 500 tanks in the industry standard database in TankTerminals.com. Orbital Insight also used its own algorithms to calculate how much was in the tanks by examining their roofs, which rise and fall depending on how much oil is being stored. “As the reservoirs are filled and emptied, the roofs rise and fall, reflected in the crescent moon-like shadows from the walls of the reservoir,” the company said in a release. Orbital Insight honed this technique on about 6,000 tanks in the United States, comparing its figures with those of the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Recently the firm said it could come up with statistics faster than the International Energy Agency, something that could be valuable to oil traders — customers the firm is trying hard to woo. The firm, however, cannot discern whether there are underground storage facilities. Orbital Insight’s estimate far exceeds the figure given in a rare glimpse of China’s oil supplies by its government. On Sept. 2, the state-owned Xinhua news agency reported that China had 287 million barrels of oil in strategic storage sites in eight cities as well as in commercial facilities at the beginning of the year. Started in 2004, the Chinese strategic stockpile would be enough to cover only 36 days of oil imports, Xinhua said, based on data from the China National Petroleum Corp.’s Research Institute of Economics and Technology. China’s goal is to have large enough strategic stockpiles to cover 100 days of imports, a target the government’s five-year plan said might not be completed by the 2020 goal. The U.S. reserve is large enough to cover about 150 days of imports. However, with low prices, China has been on a buying spree, many analysts believe. Investment banks and other analysts have estimated that China has been importing 600,000 to 1.2 million barrels a day more than it needs for consumption. If China has just been bargain hunting, it could cut imports and help keep prices low. Or it could press ahead to reach its 100-day goal. If Orbital Insight is right, that could be closer than anyone thought.

Chromification Continues: Firefox May Use Chrome's PDF and Flash Plugins GO Mozilla testing PDFium and Pepper Flash integration Sep 30, 2016 14:50 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Mozilla announced today Project Mortar, an initiative to explore the possibility of deploying alternative technologies in Firefox to replace its internal implementations, as a cost-cutting measure. The project's first two goals are to test two Chrome plugins within the Firefox codebase. These are PDFium, the Chrome plugin for viewing PDF files, and Pepper Flash, Google's custom implementation of Adobe Flash. "In order to enable stronger focus on advancing the Web and to reduce the complexity and long term maintenance cost of Firefox, and as part of our strategy to remove generic plugin support, we are launching Project Mortar," said Johnny Stenback, Senior Director Of Engineering at Mozilla Corporation. "Project Mortar seeks to reduce the time Mozilla spends on technologies that are required to provide a complete web browsing experience, but are not a core piece of the Web platform," Stenback adds. "We will be looking for opportunities to replace such technologies with other existing alternatives, including implementations by other browser vendors." Firefox lost a massive amount of users, surpassed by Safari With a market share that has plummeted in the past year, Firefox is losing users and search engine traffic that helps the organization pay the bills. Firefox development is difficult not only because of the multitude of bugs Mozilla engineers have to fix but also because of the costs that come with having to support a huge staff to fix those issues. Currently, several sources place Firefox under Safari in terms of market share. Gone are the days of Firefox fighting for the top spot with IE, and here come the days of fighting for the fourth position with Edge. Browser market share (via W3Counter) As a direct result of this downward spiral, Mozilla's leadership is looking into cutting down costs by replacing some of their code with open-source projects managed by Google. "In order to keep costs low, we may use APIs internally that are not considered web standards," Stenback continued. "The project will start by investigating how Firefox handles PDF rendering followed by looking into lower cost approaches to providing Flash support as it’s usage continues to decrease." Firefox may use the inferior PDFium over PDF.js For the rest of 2016 and the start of 2017, Mozilla engineers will be testing custom Firefox builds that use the Chromium project's PDFium plugin as Firefox's PDF file handler. Currently, Firefox uses the PDF.js library. Even if PDF.js is a superior product to PDFium, with many more features, the costs of maintaining PDFium are supported by Google, which is an attractive point for Mozilla. Asked what would happen to PDF.js, Stenback answered, "This should have no real impact on PDF.js as a standalone project. If our efforts on using PDFium in Firefox gives us a bigger bang for the buck, Firefox will most likely switch to PDFium and no longer use PDF.js though. I don't see why PDF.js wouldn't continue to live on and continue to be used by others." Nobody will miss the Flash NPAPI plugin Pepper Flash, which is the custom version of Adobe's Flash Player that ships with some Chromium browsers, is also a bulletpoint on Project Mortar's list, but no tests have been carried out yet. Firefox still uses the NPAPI (Netscape) version of the Flash Player plugin, but Mozilla said in October 2015 that it plans to ditch all NPAPI plugins by Firefox 53, scheduled for release next year. Google has designed a newer version of the Flash Player NPAPI plugin, called Flash Player PPAPI plugin (or Pepper Flash), which it began shipping with its browser since version 21, released in July 2012. "If successful, this work will allow us to completely remove NPAPI support from Firefox once NPAPI is disabled for general plugin use," Stenback said. According to the official Project Mortar wiki page, if approved, PDFium and Pepper Flash will be added to Firefox as system add-ons. The exact release date has yet to be decided.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Firefox#Chrome#Flash#PDFium#Mozilla subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Firefox Gets Floating Video and Web Screenshot Support via Test Pilot Program Mozilla Pulls the Plug on Firefox OS for Good Adjust This Setting Before Firefox Wears Down Your SSD Drive Mozilla Narrows Down New Logo Options to Four Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Microsoft Can’t Kill Linux Right Now, The Linux Foundation Director Says iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “Touch Disease” Repairs Cost $149, Apple Says German Police Considering Move to Windows Phones to Fight Traffic Jams Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Leaks in Press Render NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk 2 photos    Firefox may integrate some Chrome plugins Related Apps Dbvisit Replicate: Create a duplicate for your Oracle database for backup or migration purpose with the help of this advanced and effective program POPcon PRO: Advanced program that helps you retrieve messages from POP3 mailboxes and deliver them to your Microsoft Exchange Server mailboxes using antispam, archive, antivirus engine, rule-based distribution and scheduled tasks MirrorSync: Synchronize an offline database running on FileMaker Go or FileMaker Pro with a multi-user database hosted by the FileMaker Server Web Pictures Downloader: Effortlessly download large numbers of images and thumbnails from various websites, with the help of this easy-to-use piece of software HTTPS Checker: Make sure that your website's content works with the HTTPS protocol and that the visitors' sensitive data stays untouched with the help of this useful mixed content checker Enigmail: Add OpenPGP encryption and authentication to the email messages you send from Thunderbird, thanks to this user-friendly extension Caret: Convert text to HTML with the help of the Markdown language, within a minimalist and stylish user interface by relying on this efficient app Reader comments Load old comments   President-Elect Donald Trump Says He’ll No Longer Go Bananas Online more on: Donald Trump i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

After changing the name of its business services cloud from ‘Google for Work’ to ‘Google Cloud’ and ‘Google Apps for Work’ to ‘G Suite,’ the company has now changed its Official Google Blog to The Keyword. The company news source can be found at blog.google and aggregates all the content it publishes from across 19 blogs into one place — ranging from posts on Street View images to reducing energy use in its data centers. In a post welcoming readers to the new publication, editor-in-chief Emily Wood states that Google’s first post on the Official Google Blog was published more than 12 years ago, “before Chrome, before Android, before YouTube.” Since then, thousands of posts have been published across its large family of blogs. The aim with The Keyword, says Wood, is to create a blog that will grow and change with the company. “So as we introduce new products and technologies they can find a home here,” writes Wood, adding, “It will also guide you to the big news of the week while leaving room for smaller, fun updates from that afternoon.” As for the new name, The Keyword is a nod to the origins of search, and thus the origins of Google.

A Google self-driving Lexus was involved in a crash in Mountain View, Calif. on Friday afternoon. Fortunately, no one was injured. According to a report from local TV station KRON, the Google car was, indeed, driving autonomously at the time of the crash, but was not at fault. The incident happened at around 1:30 p.m. near El Camino Real and Phyllis Avenue, when another vehicle ran a red light and hit the passenger side of Google's car. "A Google vehicle was traveling northbound on Phyllis Ave. in Mountain View when a car heading westbound on El Camino Real ran a red light and collided with the right side of our vehicle," Google said in a statement to PCMag. "Our light was green for at least six seconds before our car entered the intersection." The tech giant also used this opportunity to remind everyone why it's developing self-driving cars. "Thousands of crashes happen everyday on US roads, and red-light running is the leading cause of urban crashes in the US. Human error plays a role in 94 percent of these crashes, which is why we're developing fully self-driving technology to make our roads safer," Google said. According to KRON, a human was behind the wheel of Google's car at the time of the incident. The Google vehicle (and presumably the human behind the wheel) sensed the other car crossing the intersection, at which point the human took over and applied the brakes, but the crash was unavoidable. //Related Articles Driverless Cars: When the Internet Takes the Wheel Images captured by bystanders show that the Google car with a huge dent on the passenger side, as you can see above. The incident comes after a Google self-driving Lexus in February struck the side of a passing bus. That time, the Google car was at least partially responsible for the collision.

Google will have other hardware on display during the event, but the company is also expected to unveil a massive milestone for Android. Andromeda, as a new operating system is internally called, might be the most important thing coming out of Google’s October 4th event. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 review “We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we’ll be talking about Oct 4, 2016,” Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer said cryptically on Twitter during the weekend. That’s the kind of message the often-accurate Android Police can interpret differently than most of us. The Android site has been sitting on information that something big is coming at Google’s event on October 4th. The announcement is greater than Pixel phones and bigger than Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, and Google WiFi, the site says. It’s probably Andromeda, Android Police thinks, the Android version that incorporates Chrome OS. Google has been rumored to merge the two platforms for a while now, and it may all happen next year. An Android operating system that has Chrome OS abilities would put Google in a position where it could propose buyers decent PC computing alternatives to Mac and Windows. Not to mention that Andromeda might be compatible with all Pixel-branded gadgets. We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) September 24, 2016 Lockheimer’s tweet is certainly interesting even if Android Police’s explanation isn’t true. If Google is going to tease anything Android-related on October 4th, it’s definitely something that will affect the entire future of Android. Color us intrigued, Google!

Google Expands Waze Ride-Sharing Test To San Francisco Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Expands Waze Ride-Sharing Test To San Francisco Image courtesy of JayRaz September 30, 2016 9:32 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk the carpool bandwagon carpooling Waze Rider waze google ride-sharing transportation san francisco What’s that sound? It’s Google knocking on Uber and Lyft’s doors to tell them it’s come out to play: the technology giant is taking one step further into providing transportation by expanding its pilot ride-sharing program to San Francisco. Anyone in San Francisco with a smartphone — surely, there must be a few people — can now download the Waze Rider app and request carpooled rides to and from work, The Wall Street Journal reports. Drivers on the platform use Google’s Waze navigation app. Last May Google launched a test of the service for workers at some area employers, but Waze Rider has been slowly rolling out to San Francisco users for several weeks, Google confirmed to the WSJ. As for how well the service works, a WSJ reporter went on a Waze Rider trip this week and said there were a few hiccups, like the app’s failure to show the rider where the driver’s car was before it arrived, and the driver had trouble using Waze’s navigation service. All told, he gave it a thumbs up. There are some limits on the program, as Google’s goal is to make the service simply a way to connect drivers and riders headed in the same direction: drivers and riders have a two-trip daily limit as the service is intended for carpooling to and from work. It’s also too cheap right now for drivers to make a living from the app. For example, on the reporter’s test ride, the driver — who doesn’t work for Lyft or Uber because she has a full-time job, she says — made $6.30 for the 20-minute ride, and the rider paid a special discounted price of $3. She said she signed up to be a driver because it was “hassle-free,” and that she’ll likely do it again as an easy way to earn a few extra bucks on her commute. “I think it’ll catch on,” she told the WSJ. “It’s cheap and it’s easy.” Google Quietly Expands Ride-Sharing Service [The Wall Street Journal] September 30, 2016 By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk the carpool bandwagon carpooling Waze Rider waze google ride-sharing transportation san francisco Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related carpool competition Google Launching Actual Ride-Sharing Pilot To Compete With Uber, Lyft riding in cars with strangers Waze Taking On Uber, Lyft In San Francisco With Carpool Service get me to the church on time Lyft Partners With Waze In Effort To Be Faster, More Efficient Than The Competition hello new friends Uber Testing Bus-Like Feature That Gives Passengers A Discount For Getting Picked Up Along “Smart Routes” this is a good spot Uber Testing Feature That Suggests Safe, Convenient Pickup Spots When Customers Request A Ride Previous Wells Fargo On The Hook For $24.5M Over Servicemember Abuses Next Instacart Replaces Tips With “Service Amounts,” But Are Workers Being Stiffed?

According to Android Police, Google will be unveiling a new operating system, currently nicknamed ‘Andromeda,’ which combines its two major software platforms. That’s in addition to previously rumored announcements of two Pixel phones, a new Chromecast, a new Wi-Fi router, and a release date for Google Home (an Amazon Echo competitor). Mind you, Andromeda is separate from the company’s ongoing project to bring Android apps into Chrome OS. In fact, Andromeda appears to be the opposite: it’s based off of Android, and pulls in features from Chrome OS. It’s also separate from the Fuchsia OS we reported on last month, which is focused on IoT devices. The company may also announce a new laptop codenamed ‘Bison’ (nicknamed Pixel 3). The report emphasizes that the laptop will not be marketed as a Chromebook, but instead as its own entity. Rumored specs suggest the laptop will take a page off of Microsoft’s Surface Book; the 12.3″ device will supposedly include a ‘tablet’ mode and stylus. Internally, there may be two models with “either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM.” All this will fit in a device under 10 mm thick. Unfortunately, this laptop wouldn’t be due until Q3 2017, and a lot could change about the hardware between now and then. Still, a legitimate Google laptop sounds like an exciting prospect. Part of the issue with Chrome OS is that while you can do a lot on the Web, you will almost always have to turn to something more powerful if you want to get serious work done. But Andromeda could mitigate this by building off of Android with a legitimate laptop form factor and specs. Perhaps we will see a true contender to Windows and Mac OS at last. In any case, the Andromeda launch seems fairly likely at this point. At the very least, Google thinks October 4 will be a big deal; Senior VP of Android Hiroshi Lockheimer tweeted this out over the weekend: We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) September 24, 2016 Comparing the upcoming event to the original Android launch is no small statement.

The Mountain View company is delaying the launch of Android 2.0, the software’s forthcoming revamp, from the fall of this year to sometime in early 2017. The good news? Google released a consolatory new preview: Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview 3. In many ways, Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview 3 represents, as its long-winded name might suggest, a milestone for the work-in-progress operating system. But an addition that stands above the rest is the Play Store for Android Wear, an app store optimized for smartwatches. It’s replete with a list of recommended apps and games, the ability to switch between different accounts, buttons for enrolling in alpha or beta programs, and a “My apps” screen from which you can update or remove installed apps. And on the distribution side of things, it allows developers to publish apps exclusively to Android Wear — they won’t appear appear visible in the Play Store on Android phones. Related: Android Wear 2.0 brings handwriting recognition and smarter watch faces The addition of the Play Store to Android Wear was the result of “studies” on user behavior, Google said. Most smartwatch wearers, the search giant found, expected to find apps right on their wearable. “[They] told us [they] wanted to make it easier … to discover apps,” Google said. A miniaturized Play Store presented the perfect solution. “The Play Store on the watch helps users find apps right where they need them.” You’d be forgiven for assuming a wrist-bound app store obviates the need for phone-based management. That’s largely the case — the Play Store is accessible when the watch is connected to Wi-Fi or, on devices with cellular capabilities, a carrier network. But you can’t quite leave your phone at home: purchases for paid apps must be authenticated on a paired handset. (Google said it plans to eliminate that requirement down the line.) An app store isn’t the only big improvement in tow with Android Wear 2.0. Another major enhancement is Smart Replies, a feature of Google’s artificially intelligent Google Assistant platform that supplies canned responses to messages and emails. Uniquely, the Android Wear incarnation generates replies using an “entirely on-watch” machine-learning model, Google said. “No data is uploaded to the cloud to generate the responses.” image01More Related: Developer Preview 2 of Android Wear 2.0 is out now! Here’s what’s new Meanwhile, Complications, the information-rich animated icons that dot custom watch faces, default to developer-specified settings in Developer Preview 3. And two new development tools, WearableRecyclerView and Inline Action for Notifications, help make it easier for developers to create vertical lists and let users take action on notifications “right from the stream.” Read More Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview 3 is available now, but only for a select few watches: the Huawei Watch and LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition. If you’re the lucky owner of either of those, you can nab the appropriate build from the Android Developer website. A word of warning, though — installation isn’t a cakewalk. The steps require a familiarity with Android’s developer suite, and Developer Preview 3 contains a few bugs that some might consider deal-breaking. Google’s fitness platform, Google Fit, isn’t available with Preview 3; “OK Google” voice detection doesn’t work reliably; and Smart Reply is only available if your watch’s system language is English. Alternatively, you can test Developer Preview 3 on an emulator. image03More Related: Google is reportedly making two Android Wear smartwatches integrated with Assistant Android Wear devices, some might say, are stuck between a rock and a hard place. They’re by nature pitted against Apple’s juggernaut wearable, the Apple Watch, which commanded a 33.5 percent share of the U.S. smartwatch market in the three-month period that ended with July (see: Kantar Worldpanel). And they compete with smartwatch offerings from the likes of Samsung and Tencent, which run proprietary operating systems with incompatible app stores. Analysts say that has generated hesitancy on the part of Google’s partners: though Asus, Fossil, Michael Kors, Polar, and Nixon announced Android Wear smartwatches this year, Motorola, Huawei, and LG did not. (Huawei, in fact, may be considering a move to Samsung’s Tizen operating system.) Google may be poised to take matters into its own hands. In July, rumors emerged of two Google-made Nexus smartwatches, code-named Angelfish and Swordfish. The former, Angelfish, reportedly features “smooth housing shape that curves where the watch band meets the body,” three physical buttons, and myriad sensors including a heart-rate monitor, GPS, and LTE connectivity. The latter, which sports a “gentle and rounded” shape, by contrast, is said to resemble the Apple Watch.

Google got the core of their experience off the ground, however users have been requesting additional features that could only help to enhance the service. Thankfully, the app’s lead developer isn’t shy about acknowledging them. Justin Uberti has listed the 7 most request Allo features. In no way does his publicizing the list mean any or all of these featues will eventually make it in, but it’s nice to see what folks are clamoring to have. Let’s take a look at all of them and their probably of making it into the Allo app: Assistant Features: Not an unreasonable request, but also one that will obviously be fulfilled. Google Assistant’s “preview” tag already confirms it’s not 100% ready, and Google has expressed their desire for Assistant to be an ever-growing entity since announcing it at Google I/O. Desktop App: Allo was never meant to be a Hangouts replacement, it seems, so we’re not sure a desktop companion will ever arrive. Coupled with the belief that Google wants Allo to be geared toward mobile — something that’s supported by the fact that it uses phone numbers for registration and currently doesn’t allow usage across multiple devices — we’ll opt not to hold our breath on this one. Duo Integration: Allo was always seen as the perfect companion for Duo, and Uberti has expressed plans to get better integration between the two in the past. Mark this one as a go File Sharing: Allo already has photo sharing, but full-fledged document sharing is becoming standard in any premier messaging app. It’s unclear if Google will ever want to overcomplicate their experience with anything like Google Drive integration, but it’ll need more than just photos if it wants to be a WhatsApp competitor. Quick Reply: The automatic quick response options are nice, but sometimes they aren’t perfect, and we’d think Allo is the perfect app to make use of Android Nougat’s new Quick Reply feature. We see no good reason for Google not to add this (aside from maybe a sly way to showcase Google Assistant’s sublime AI). SMS: This is the controversial one. It’s the single biggest issue keeping many from making Allo their go-to app. If Google is suffering any usage issues — and early polls suggest they are — they could cave and add true SMS fallback. We’re going to bet Google is working on better SMS support, especially since Uberti doesn’t seem interested in ruling it out just yet. Themes: Google’s “be together, not the same” mantra hasn’t exactly extended to many of their products. Google Keyboard is the only notable situation we can think of where Google allowed free customization of the way an app looks. But mostly, you get what they’re willing to give you. Aside from perhaps a dark mode, we’re going to say the chances of this one are slim. Note that these requests aren’t ordered by anything other than the order of the alphabet. Uberti isn’t letting loose word on whether any of these are in the works or, if they are, how far along they’ve gotten. But it’s nice to see what’s sitting atop their request list and hopefully it closely matches whatever’s currently written on their priority development board.

Yes, of course you do. Google’s highly successful $35 dongle has been a hit among consumers, but its virtues may expand far beyond that. According to an exclusive Variety report, in fact, it may well have proved to be a proper Trojan horse for Google, who’s now seeking partners’ attention to build yet more appliances around its technology… The upcoming Google Home — which is, essentially, Mountain View’s answer to the Amazon Echo — is not only powered by the firm’s smart Assistant, but also fuelled by the same Google Cast that is in fact giving life to the millions of Chromecasts around the world — and that is a big deal. A kosher Trojan horse, we were saying, paraphrasing an expression used by one of the attendees of Google‘s secret meeting which immediately followed the original Home announcement back at this past May’s I/O keynote. Alongside representatives of the search giant, several of “the biggest names of home audio” took part, to talk about Assistant and its forthcoming invasion of people’s homes. And, apparently, the crux of it was Google’s essential opening to third parties to take advantage of Google Cast and enable a platoon of Home peers, with some of these brands allegedly “ready to unveil speakers with integrated microphones and a connection to Google’s assistant as early as next summer”. And it’s precisely Google Cast — whose engineering team is largely responsible for Home, too — that may represent a turning point for both Google and manufacturers, scared by Amazon’s move taking users away from its more natural search bar habitat and other brands like Sonos respectively. Cast-compatible streaming apps are in fact already out there, with Spotify, Tunein, Pandora, NPR One and SoundCloud being some of the most notable examples. But Home — and other potential Assistant-powered speakers — is also a Cast sender, which means its integrated microphones will let you yell at it and have other Cast-compatible devices complete the task for you; for instance, you could ask Home to play YouTube on your TV (granted that a Chromecast is already plugged into it), or ask your Cast-enabled devices, like Chromecast Audio-connected speakers, to play music for you in unison. However, there’s still much to be seen before making this a reality. For one, it was said that during the aforementioned meeting Google truly flexed its negotiating muscle, demanding that such Google Cast-enabled, Assistant-powered third party hardware should not allow for any other digital assistant to share the room, something Variety claims “ultimately led to talks breaking down” regarding “similarly far-reaching demands made in negotiations with another big consumer electronics manufacturer”. Google certainly is planning a general hardware invasion, but as far as the home goes, we will have to wait and see how it’ll all play out.

The plans include expanding the geographic footprint of its datacentre portfolio to eight more regions during 2017, spanning London, Frankfurt and Finland, along with Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Northern Virginia and Sao Paulo. The company currently operates five regions, with Tokyo to come online later this year. “By expanding to new regions, we deliver higher performance to customers,” wrote Brian Stevens, vice-president of Google Cloud, in a blog post. “In fact, our recent expansion in Oregon resulted in up to 80% improvement in latency for customers.” Google is the latest cloud giant to share its datacentre expansion plans, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) announcing its intention on 29 September to create a region of its own with Paris to better serve the needs of its European customers. The latency improvements Google mentioned in its blog post are not the only reason why AWS, Microsoft and others are investing in growing their global datacentre presence. Ever-shifting data protection legislation has also created demand for locally hosted cloud services from enterprises, with regulators in various industries insisting that companies must host their data in the same country as the customers they serve. The company is also taking steps to take a more hands-on approach to support issues with its enterprise customers by creating the customer reliability engineering role within the Google Cloud Platform team. Read more about Google Cloud Platform Google seems intent on spending 2016 reminding enterprise CIOs that it is not just the Amazon, Microsoft and IBM clouds they should be considering when working out where to move their on-premise workloads. Google is to open 12 datacentre regions between 2016 and 2017, as it steps up its efforts to grab a larger slice of cloud infrastructure services market. Google said these engineers would work closely with customers’ own operations staff, and would share responsibility for ensuring their cloud applications remain up and running. “This integration represents a new model in which we share and apply our nearly two decades of experience in cloud computing as an embedded part of our customers’ organisation,” the blog post said. In a similar vein, Google has announced a partnership with Accenture to bring to market jointly created services and products aimed at the retail, healthcare, consumer, energy and finance sectors Machine learning for all Earlier this week, at its Ignite conference in Atlanta, Georgia, Google cloud rival Microsoft opened up about its machine learning and artificial intelligence ambitions, in terms of how it is embedding these capabilities into its cloud platform and services. Google, meanwhile, has confirmed the roll-out of its machine learning tools to business users of its cloud storage, data warehouse and big data processing services to help enterprises make better use of their information. The company said this would be backed by the introduction of certification programmes to speed up the time it takes businesses to get to grips with its machine learning technology.

Oracle denied new trial in copyright dispute with Google over Java John Ribeiro | Sept. 30, 2016 A federal court in California has denied Oracle another trial in its long-standing copyright infringement dispute with Google over the use of Java code in the Android operating system. A jury had cleared Google of copyright infringement in May this year, upholding the company’s stand that its use of 37 Java APIs (application programming interfaces) in its Android mobile operating system was fair use, thus denying Oracle up to US$9 billion in damages that it was seeking. A number of developers and scientists  backed Google saying that APIs, which are the specifications that let programs communicate with each other, were not copyrightable and any bid to change that would stifle innovation. The administration of President Barack Obama had in its opinion sided with Oracle and said that the APIs are copyrightable like other computer code. Oracle asked the court for a new trial on, among other grounds, the claim that Google concealed information during discovery on its plans to integrate Android apps with the Chrome OS running on desktops and laptops, thus extending the scope of the infringement beyond smartphones and tablets. District Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in an order on Tuesday denied Oracle’s request for a new trial, which would have been the third in the dispute. In 2015, Google began a new project, which it called internally as ARC++. Its aim, according to court records was to “[p]rovide Chrome OS users with Play Android apps on Chrome OS without developer action.” “ARC++ would run an isolated instance of Android (with all of Android’s public APIs, including those reimplemented from Java) in order to allow users to run all Android apps on Chrome OS devices. Google planned to include its 'Play Store' — Google’s app wherein users could purchase and download other Android apps — as part of ARC++ to facilitate access to those apps,” wrote Judge Alsup in his order. The Judge did not go along with Oracle’s claim that Google had “stonewalled and had completely concealed the ARC++ project.” Google had produced at least nine documents discussing the goals and technical details of ARC++ in 2015, at least five months before trial, wrote the judge, who added that “Oracle’s failure to review the ARC++ documents is its own fault.” Judge Alsup pointed out that the evidence on ARC++ would not have impacted the trial in May because any evidence relating to implementations of Android on devices other than smartphones and tablets fell outside its scope. “It may well be true that the use of the copyrighted APIs in ARC++ (or any other later use) will not qualify as a fair use, but that will not and does not mean that Google’s argument on transformative use as to the original uses on trial (smartphones and tablets) was improper. That Oracle failed to detect the ARC++ documents in its possession had no consequence within the defined scope of our trial,” Judge Alsup wrote. Oracle had argued in its motion for a new trial that it was a mistake to limit the devices to smartphones and tablets. Google’s launch of the full Android system on the Chrome OS is even now in its preliminary stages and available only to developers and on a limited set of devices, the Judge observed. The Judge's order also dismissed Oracle's demand for a new trial because of the exclusion of what the judge described as “minor evidence and testimony” from Stefano Mazzocchi, a member of the board of directors of the Apache Software Foundation in 2008. It also rejected Oracle’s contention that the court had improperly excluded its document containing replies to the European Commission, which had asked for an explanation of the dispute between Google and Sun Microsystems, the company that developed Java and was later acquired by Oracle. Google and Oracle could not be immediately reached for comment on the order.   You might be interested in Apple will cut App Store fees for video streaming apps by half Apple saves iPhone call history to iCloud, but barely mentions it Azure October Roundup: Price drops, data analysis, and more Snapchat parent reportedly headed for an IPO APAC marketers are looking into more mobile and cross-device advertising Sign up for our enewsletters Home

In this post, we’ll go through ALL of the default applications that come installed with Apple’s desktop operating system, explain what they do, and whether you should care about them or not.

Automator.app (Very Useful): This app provides a way for you to automate hundreds of different system actions that you can combine and use to perform complex tasks without any programming or scripting knowledge. Do you need it? Not really. Should you learn it? Absolutely. Ads by Google Calculator.app (Useful): I personally use this app on a daily basis, whether to update my personal budgets, calculate estimated tax payments Yes, You Need to Pay Taxes on eBay & Craigslist Sales Yes, You Need to Pay Taxes on eBay & Craigslist Sales Read More , or just offload whatever bit of mental math I don’t feel like doing at the moment — but it’s often faster to use Spotlight’s instant math feature instead Search More Efficiently In Mac OS X With Our Top Spotlight Tips Search More Efficiently In Mac OS X With Our Top Spotlight Tips Spotlight has been a killer Mac feature for years, with Cupertino regularly schooling Redmond in the art of desktop search. Here are a few tips to help you find more on your Mac. Read More . Calendar.app (Very Useful): This app is a clean and efficient way to manage your day-to-day tasks. It may not be the most advanced calendar app out there, but it’s more than enough for most users who aren’t, say, running a small business. Syncs with iCloud. Chess.app (Not Useful): Why is Chess a system application in Mac? Furthermore, why did Apple think it was necessary to protect it with System Integrity Protection What Mac Users Need To Know About El Capitan Security What Mac Users Need To Know About El Capitan Security Security is the biggest change to OS X 10.11 El Capitan.

Chess is just a straightforward offline-only chess app. Contacts.app (Useful): This app is essentially a digital Rolodex that stores contact information on your friends, family members, and acquaintances. It syncs with iCloud, allowing the information to be used in other iCloud apps like Mail. Dashboard.app (Useful): Dashboard provides a central screen that you can load up with widgets. A widget is like an interactive “mini-app” that only resides on Dashboard, like a calendar viewer or a weather forecast. And yes, you can install third-party widgets if you want 11 Mac Dashboard Widgets You'll Actually Use 11 Mac Dashboard Widgets You'll Actually Use How long has it been since you used your Mac's Dashboard?

Dictionary.app (Useful): A simple but potentially useful app if you ever need access to a dictionary, thesaurus, or Wikipedia. Provided by the New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford American Writer’s Thesaurus, respectively. I personally never use it. DVD Player.app (Not Useful): This app may as well be obsolete. Modern Macbooks, iMacs, and other Apple machines don’t come equipped with DVD drives anymore, so DVD Player is only useful if you have something like an external DVD drive. Besides, apps like VLC can handle DVD playback anyway. FaceTime.app (Useful): FaceTime is basically the Apple version of a more streamlined Skype: you can initiate and receive both audio calls and video calls with other FaceTime users. Unfortunately this means you can only use this between Apple devices. If you have friends or family on Windows or Android, you’ll need Skype, Google Hangouts, and so on. Font Book.app (Very Useful): Unlike in Windows or Linux, Mac comes with a built-in font management utility that makes it a breeze to install, preview, and delete font families from your system. I like it because I’m a big font freak Spruce Up Your Website With These 12 Beautiful Google Web Fonts Spruce Up Your Website With These 12 Beautiful Google Web Fonts Over the past decade, I've started a number of personal blogs that I never really followed through with, but some of my fondest memories rest on theme design and font tweaks.

Game Center.app (Not Useful): Game Center is meant to be a central area where you can find games, both single- and multi-player, to play on your own or with friends. It requires your Apple ID as a sign-in. Unfortunately there aren’t many games, and the ones that exist aren’t noteworthy. For Mac App Store games, Apple forces developers to use Game Center for multiplayer — hence why you’re often better off buying elsewhere instead Why You Should Avoid Buying Games From The Mac App Store Why You Should Avoid Buying Games From The Mac App Store The Mac App Store doesn't hold a candle to the same store used by iPhone and iPad users to guzzle apps, games and in-app purchases.

A lot of new musicians use this as a stepping stone to more complex apps like Logic Pro X, and it’s so useful that this app alone is one reason why some Windows users convert to Mac in the first place. iBooks.app (Useful): iBooks is like iTunes for ebooks. It comes with a built-in store where you can purchase thousands of titles (including recent mainstream releases) or you can import your own if you have ebooks on your system. I primary use it as an ebook reader and manager — and I love it because it’s both simple and beautiful. Supports both EPUB and PDF formats. iMovie.app (Useful): A simple and intuitive movie editor that you can pretty much think of as “GarageBand for movies”. You can import raw clips and images, edit them together, and polish off with text, music, and basic post-processing effects. You’d be surprised by how many YouTube videos were made using iMovie! iTunes.app (Useful): Everyone knows about iTunes — even those who have never touched a Mac in their life! Over the years, it has morphed into a kind of all-in-one media manager for music, movies, TV shows, and iOS devices. but I primarily use it for managing and listening to podcasts 15 Top-Notch Podcasts for Programmers & Software Developers 15 Top-Notch Podcasts for Programmers & Software Developers Podcasts are a fantastic way to learn more about programming.

Read More because iTunes is bloated and can be slow at times. Image Capture.app (Not Useful): If you have a scanner or camera connected to your computer, you can use Image Capture to take images. Some older digital cameras may rely on an app like Image Capture to import directly from the device, but most now have Wi-Fi sharing (or you can just pop the SD card into your reader). Keynote.app (Useful): Keynote is Apple’s answer to Microsoft PowerPoint. With it, you can create all kinds of interesting presentations Create Elegant & Cool Multimedia Presentations Using Apple's Popular Keynote [Mac] Create Elegant & Cool Multimedia Presentations Using Apple's Popular Keynote [Mac] The best demos of Apple's multimedia program, Keynote, are the ones co-produced by the legendary Steve Jobs.

It can import and export to PowerPoint formats, so no need to worry about compatibility. Launchpad.app (Not Useful): Launchpad was added as a way to unify the experience between iOS and Mac, but I’m not sure this was necessary. Its primary function is to help you find and launch apps, but Spotlight can do the same thing (and Spotlight is objectively better in every way, especially because it can find lost files in a heartbeat How to Find Lost Files on Mac OS X How to Find Lost Files on Mac OS X We've all been there: you finish working on a document, save it, close the window, and... where'd it go? Read More ). You can access launchpad by hitting F4, or pinching with four or more fingers on a trackpad. Mail.app (Useful): The default app for handling email accounts and inboxes. It’s actually quite good if you ask me, but I don’t use it because there are a few interface quirks that I don’t like. Instead, I use Postbox as an alternative mail client, 5 Apple Mail Alternatives for Mac OS X 5 Apple Mail Alternatives for Mac OS X Every Mac comes with a free email application, but it's not the be-all and end-all of OS X email solutions.

Maps.app (Useful): To be honest, I really like Maps because the interface is straightforward without being primitive and the animations are buttery smooth. You can also send directions straight to your iPhone or iPad via the Share button, which is nice. Unfortunately it’s still not quite as good as Google Maps 13 Google Maps Tips for Smarter Navigation on Your iPhone 13 Google Maps Tips for Smarter Navigation on Your iPhone Google Maps is a "communication tool" now. Let's look into the benefits – some new, and some old – which can help us make sense of the world around us. Read More . Messages.app (Useful): Messages lets you send and receive unlimited text messages with other iMessage users, and these messages can include photos, audio clips, and other kinds of files.

This makes it really easy to switch from one app to another without command+tabbing a bunch of times, especially if you have ten or more apps open. It’s also great for managing multiple virtual desktops How to Use Multiple Desktops in Mac OS X How to Use Multiple Desktops in Mac OS X Multiple desktops were originally added Apple’s desktop operating system in 2009, but a large number of users are still surprised to find the feature exists at all.

It’s too bad that Apple chose to name it this way — the app itself is great, but the name is vague especially when looking for Numbers tips online. If you do a lot of spreadsheet work, you’ll use this one a lot. Pages.app (Useful): Here we have Apple’s answer to Microsoft Word and the trend holds true here: simple, straightforward, but nowhere near as feature-rich.

Photo Booth can do that using your Mac’s built-in camera, or an externally-connected camera, in three modes: single photo, four quick photos, or a movie clip. You can also add over 20 different effects if you want to have some fun. Photos.app (Useful): A central library that makes it easy to organize and manage your photos and videos. It won’t take photos or videos (use Photo Booth for that) but it’s great for storing albums and creating “projects” like slideshows, prints, cards, and so on. It can even edit RAW files, but serious photographers should still consider using Lightroom 3 Reasons All Photographers Should be Using Adobe Lightroom 3 Reasons All Photographers Should be Using Adobe Lightroom A lot of people aren't quite sure where Lightroom fits into things.

I'd like to think I have a good reason (I don't). I have worked with / for Apple for over a decade. I believe if you really considering switching to Apple devices now in the late 2016, not knowing what some native applications (doesn't) do is the least of your troubles... This is my take on the list above clearifying some of the reasons: AppStore - source of "iOSque" software. Only rarely can you find something usefull here. Good developers woldn't touch it with a bargepole. Automator - yes, you can stick with bash, that is why you have bought a unix based device in the first place, ain't it? (Alternatively you don't know what UNIX is and than you are a victim). Calculator - useless, but common Calendar - useless, famously unreliable, will not play well even with OS X Server. Chess - I've been using Macs for over a decade, this is the first time I have noticed! Contacts - the iOS have duplicated your contacts? This app has decent chance of fixing it without loosing too much data. Dashboard - useless feature a lot of people are surprised still exists Dictionary - useless DVD player - useless FaceTime - hw specific chat software, like a bread you can only cut with a golden knife, useless Font Book - old as os x itself, usefull for dealing with font issues (if you are the sort of person who has font issues). Game Center - bad joke GarageBand - audio editor for pre-teens iBooks - compared to Calibre useless iMovie - video editor for pre-teens iTunes - a prison for your iPhone ImageCapture - because iPhone will not act as Mass Storage device Keynote - so little features and so much hype, 10 templates chosen with taste Launchpad - "iOSque" program launcher, useless Mail.app - yes, you need to restart this app 7 times a day to make it catch up with your iPhone Maps.app - On desktop? I don't get it! Messages.app - the face time faux-pas all over again, should be noted that it does not play well with OS X server Mission Control - very uneffective task/window switching Notes.app - hw specific note taking app (unlike evernote, simplenote or onenote) Numbers.app - hw specific spreadsheet app - you'll do better with libre office Pages.app - hw specific text editor app - you still haven't installed libre office? PhotoBooth.app - because taking selfies with a phone is so hard Photos.app - the reason one does no longer use local photo managers (unless you are a professional and you are ready to suffer for it) Preview.app - universal file viewer, usefull! QuckTimePlayer.app - some usefull features offset by its inability to play most video / audio formats. Replace with VLC Reminders.app - remind me what reminders are good for? Safari.app - the lest used (and least useful) os specific browser in the world. Stickies.app - really surprised it still exists Time Machine.app - with the arrival of ssds the most reliable method of loosing all your data while having the warm feeling of daily backups. Specially dangerous in combination with the Time Capsule. Ask at your local data recovery provider :D Honorable mentions: Terminal.app - exactly what it says, very usefull HomeBrew/MacPorts - the appstore you were looking for AirPort Utility.app - so you have expected to setup your new apple router with browser? Dream on! Disk Utility.app - the only volume management app I have seen that will not read S.M.A.R.T. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Man Up Running a background check before a first date can seem a bit invasive. Finding out personal details, or even personal writing can feel too intimate, especially if you haven’t been on a date yet. But a quick Google search can also reveal important, previously withheld information, including a larceny charge or a secret significant other. Still, should someone research their date, or is it an enormous invasion of privacy? If you’re the type who wants to know everything about a first date, including where they grew up and their college major, finding a stranger online isn’t all that difficult. Here’s a quick tutorial: Simply Google everything you know at once, and the future date is sure to pop up. Combine their school, hometown, job, current location and name, and a Facebook page is bound to appear. If all else fails, put their phone number into Facebook’s search bar and a profile will appear, giving you their last name. In under five minutes, you will know who you’re dating. After asking around, the consensus seems split about this version of cyber stalking, with people either strongly for or against scrutinizing their romantic interest. “I absolutely Google stalk every single date before I go out. Sometimes I wish I wouldn’t, because I create thoughts in my head about who I think they are before I meet them. But I’ve seen one too many Dateline specials, and I don’t trust people anymore. I’ll typically do the Googling before a first date is even set. I’ve unmatched myself from people after seeing their Facebook or Twitter accounts,” one single said, explaining that she had also previously unmatched with someone after discovering their political views. Catfish has made most millennials wary about who they’re actually talking to on the internet. MTV A 20-something Brooklynite said, “Back in my Tinder days, I Googled a future hang-out and found his god-awful stand-up comedy sets on YouTube and immediately ghosted. [I’m] not proud, but not ashamed either.” Other women cite racism, sexism, mugshots, and airing dirty laundry online as reasons to cancel. Sometimes, a background check can be useful. The app Stud or Dud was made for online daters to discover whether or not their partner is lying. The app only accesses information that is readily available online, so don’t expect to find a well-hidden mugshot. They will, however, supply criminal records, property ownership (including home value), court records and work records. For one woman, Stud or Dud certainly would have proved useful. After she was introduced to a man by his mother, they began dating, and at first there were “no red flags.” After suggesting a weekend trip away, her significant other started making excuses about why he couldn’t go on a romantic vacation. She started to wonder if he was married, and began her research. Instead of discovering a wife, she found that he had shot a man in his face during a bar fight about video poker. Stud or Dud wants to find out if your date has a criminal record. Stud or Dud Catfishing isn’t only online. A New Orleans woman met a man at a bar after a few cocktails. He told her that he was in late 20s, but when she looked him up she found his high school senior picture from 1995 (close to the year that she was born). For some women and men, it’s better to find out about someone during the date, not beforehand. After all, there’s no point in knowing someone’s life story if you’re only going to join them for a single cocktail. But others warn that you should do your research, to avoid learning about someone’s indiscretions once you’re already invested.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Oracle loses latest appeal in its case against Google over Java APIs By Anthony Spadafora Oracle has once again lost an appeal regarding its ongoing legal case over the use of its Java APIs in Google's Android operating system. Shares Oracle has once again been unsuccessful in its latest effort to obtain a new trial in its Java API copyright claim against Google. Judge William Alsup of the San Francisco District Court has denied Oracle's latest motion to have its case reheard on the grounds of misconduct on the part of Google's lawyers. Since 2010, the two companies have been in an ongoing legal war that was ruled in Google's favour. However in the six years that have passed, Oracle has repeatedly appealed the ruling multiple times. The latest appeal is based around the fact that the search engine failed to disclose its intent to develop tools to run its Android mobile operating system on the desktop using the Android App Runtime for Chrome (ARC). Oracle has made the case that this move nullified Google's previous argument that its use of Java APIs was limited to mobile devices and could be considered as fair use. Judge Alsup was quick to deny Oracle's motion and reasoned that the two companies had agreed beforehand that the focus of the case was only limited to how Java APIs were used on Android smartphones and tablets. He expounded further on his decision, saying: “It may well be true that the use of the copyrighted APIs in ARC++ (or any other later use) will not qualify as a fair use, but that will not and does not mean that Google's argument on transformative use as to the original uses on trial (smartphones and tablets) was improper. That Oracle failed to detect the ARC++ documents in its possession had no consequence with the defined scope of our trial.” According to Judge Alsup, Oracle has also been picking and choosing what data in the case should be admitted and what should be omitted. He made the point that though the ARC++ information might be useful to the company's claim, a document that was left out of the original trial could have been used to back up Google's claim that Oracle/Sun had offered an open Java API years earlier. Alsup explained his argument, saying: “Sun itself had given away Java (including all of the lines of code in suit) in 2008 via its open-source OpenJDK.  In 2015, Google used OpenJDK to reimplement the Java APIs for the latest relase of Android, which it called Nougat. “Google wished to use this evidence under the fourth fair use factor to show that its infringement did no more market harm than Sun itself had already invited via its OpenJDK release.”  Image Credit: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock ABOUT THE AUTHOR Anthony Spadafora Anthony currently resides in South Korea where he teaches and experiences Korean technological advances first hand.

In short, you are suppose to type in a query, click the button and be taken to the first site Google lists in their search results. With Google Instant, Google dropped that feature but it did work when you went to settings and turned off Google Instant. There were also hacks to get it to work. But now, even with the hacks and Google Instant off, the Im Feeling Lucky button doesn't take you to a site. Instead it takes me to the search results or somewhere else. For example, if you went to https://www.google.com/search?q=Electric+Universe&btnI=Im+Feeling+Lucky adding on that parameter would typically trigger the feature but now, nope, it doesn't work. Hat tip to V3.co.uk for writing about this first. I asked Google for a comment on this and will report back when we hear. Forum discussion at Google Web Search Help and Reddit.

The impact five days after its launch was minimal to ay the least. The recoveries supposedly started on Wednesday afternoon and will take a few days to roll out. The algorithm probably rolled out in part before the 23rd and then in several parts after. Penguin 4.0 is real time but also it devalues versus demotes and I get into those details. Google said Penguin 4.0 was one of their nicest launches. Google said expect one thing, that Google will continue to have the search results change. Google began showing AMP results on desktop by accident and it broke the web for an hour or more. Google told SEOs to stop fussing about redirects. Google said the app indexing ranking boost is still in play even with AMP around. Google added science datasets to the structured data support. Google is showing green checkmarks emojis in the search results. Google said at SMX they restricted the keyword planner because of bad actors, did he mean SEOs? Google AdWords has a new site links format they are testing. Google My Business added recommendations for hiring third parties. Google My Business updated their API. Google’s I’m Feeling Lucky button is broken. Google celebrated their 18th birthday this week. That was this past week in search at the Search Engine Roundtable.

Google’s October 4th Pixel event is just around the corner and is set to be one of the company’s biggest keynotes ever. Rumours and speculation surrounding this year’s October Google launch event have run especially rampant, so we’ve sifted through everything in order to provide you with a solid summary of what to expect from the October 4th keynote. Pixel and Pixel XL All rumours point to Google dropping the ‘Nexus’ brand in favour of ‘Pixel,’ possibly jettisoning the Nexus name completely. It’s expected that along with the new name, Google’s Pixel smartphones, which are purported to be manufactured by HTC, will be a significant aesthetic revamp for the tech giant. Android Police, as well as a variety of other websites have confirmed the new phone’s moniker through a variety of sources. Similar to the Nexus 5X and Huawei 6P, it’s expected that Google will once again release two different sized smartphones this year. Development codenames, t50 (also sometimes known as Sailfish) in the Pixel’s case and t55 for the Pixel XL (also called Marlin), indicate one device will feature a 5-inch display with the other opting for 5.5-inch glass. It’s rumoured that the Pixel will be priced at $649 USD (about $852 CAD) and the Pixel XL will cost $749 USD (approximately $983 CAD). Prolific leaker Evan Blass has shared multiple leaked official press photos of both devices, which also include new Pixel-specific icons, a special pixel launcher — which has led some to believe that HTC and Google’s Pixel devices won’t run stock Android — redesigned on-screen buttons and a new, upgraded version of Google Now called Google Assistant. Other specs for the Pixel include a 1920 x 1080 pixel AMOLED display, quad-core Snapdragon 821 processor with 4GB of ram and either 32GB or 128GB or storage with no microSD slot. The phone is expected to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera with a 8-megapixel front shooter, USB-C charging and a 2,770mAh battery. The Pixel XL on the other hand, is rumoured to feature a 5.5-inch 2560 x 1440 pixel quad HD AMOLED display, Snapdragon 821 processor with 4GB of RAM, 32 or 128GB of storage and no microSD card slot, 12-megapixel rear shooter and an 8 megapixel front camera, USB-C and a larger 3,450mAh battery. Both devices will reportedly come in black, silver gold and white colour variants. Google now evolves into ‘Google Assistant’ The October 4th event may see Google’s newest AI helper, Google Assistant, explained and highlighted in further detail. It was first introduced at the Google I/O developer conference alongside Google Home, a hardware competitor to the popular Amazon Echo. Extending from the functionalities of Google Now, Google Assistant is the company’s latest version of a virtual assistant. According to the company it will be “conversational” allowing for an “ongoing two-way dialogue.” Google Home After revealing Google Home at I/O 2016, rumours indicate that the Mountain View, California-based company’s October 4th event will give us a closer look at its first attempt at a voice-activated smart home assistant. It’s expected that similar to Amazon’s Echo, Google Home will be compatible with a wide variety of devices and will link directly with Google’s services. Along with Home, Google is expected to reveal a new ‘smart’ router called Google Wi-Fi. 4K Google Chromecast Ultra It appears likely Google will release a 4K-enabled Google Chromecast Ultra which could cost around $69 USD — more than double the original Chromecast. Mobile tipster Evan Blass leaked images of the device that show a subtle change in branding, with the removal of the Chrome logo. Andromeda We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) September 24, 2016 Long-time rumours have spread the idea that Google is unifying its Chrome and Android operating systems into one system known as Andromeda, which could be shown at the 10/4 event. Leaks provided by Android Police and 9to5Google have suggested that the new OS will be on a modular laptop in 2017 and perhaps a Huawei-made tablet. Those sources noted, however, that the OS might see release in Q3 2017. But whether or not we see a full release, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google’s senior vice president focused on Android and Chrome OS, has hinted that operating system history will be made on October 4th. Google Wi-Fi Home Router A leak from Android Police suggests the device will retail for about $129 USD and look like a white Amazon Echo Dot. Users with multiple routers will reportedly be able to turn them into a Wi-Fi mesh network like the Eero. Google Daydream VR It’s possible that Google could release its own proof-of-concept Daydream VR headset at the October 4th event, or at least make an announcement regarding the headset. Daydream was announced at the Google I/O developer conference this May and its dedicated web page currently states: “Coming in Fall 2016, Daydream provides rich, responsive, and immersive experiences with hardware and software built for VR.” It’s currently unclear what hardware partners will develop for Daydream. Pixel 3 Laptop Google reportedly has plans to launch a modular laptop that will run Andromeda, the OS hybrid of Chrome and Android. Android Police has stated the codename is Bison and will hit the market in 2017, but it may be announced at the October 4th event. Huawei Tablet Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 VentureBeat reporter and renowned tipster Evan Blass has stated Google will release a Huawei-built 7-inch tablet with 4GB of RAM before the end of 2016. The October 4th event would be a logical time for launch. Whether or not all the devices and additions listed are debuted, Google’s October 4th launch event is sure to be jam-packed. To tune in, fans will likely be able to head to Google’s YouTube page or launch event page at 12 p.m. EST, or follow the breaking news on MobileSyrup.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Share My Ride Google Is Giving Uber Another Reason to Worry Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Share My Ride Google Is Giving Uber Another Reason to Worry The Silicon Valley giant just took a big step onto Uber’s turf. by Maya KosoffSeptember 30, 2016 8:28 am Email Facebook Twitter From AFP/Getty Images. The relationship between Uber and Google is a complicated one. Google Ventures invested $250 million in Uber several years ago, and you can book an Uber ride through the Google Maps app on your phone. Uber, however, has expressed few qualms about poaching Google employees. Last year, former Googler Rachel Whetstone was hired as Uber’s S.V.P. of policy and communication, replacing David Plouffe, and she took with her a whole group of Google employees to re-start Uber’s communications team. Alphabet senior vice president of corporate development David Drummond, who had served on Uber’s board, has been barred from attending the $68 billion company’s board meetings “for the better part of a year,” and stepped down from Uber’s board. And Uber and Google have similar ambitions in several spaces, including autonomous vehicles, delivery and logistics, and, yes, ride-sharing. Now, the rivalry between the two companies is beginning in earnest. The Wall Street Journal reports that Google has quietly rolled out its Uber carpooling competitor, called Waze Rider, that allows riders to request rides to and from work using Waze, the navigation app Google bought for a reported $1.3 billion in 2013. After beginning to test the app in May, Waze Rider is now easily accessible to anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area. It’s not exactly like Uber and Lyft—its intention is to match a driver with a rider headed in the same direction, and drivers are not allowed to drive more than two rides per day, nor do they make much off of the rides. In contrast, Uber drivers can pick up as many passengers as they want in a given day, and their destination isn’t a factor in accepting passenger rides. In other words, Google doesn’t seem to want Waze Rider drivers to use driving as a source of income; instead, it’s a way to make a couple extra bucks off of their existing commutes. Riders pay no more than a maximum of 54 cents per mile. Waze is typically used as a navigation app, but carpooling will ostensibly let it compete directly with Uber and Lyft, which both have their own carpooling services. Unlike Uber and Lyft, which both do basic background checks on drivers, Waze Rider drivers are not held to the same arduous screening process. One driver who spoke to the Journal said she didn’t need to pass a background check or provide proof of car insurance to drive for the company, and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, says this is because Waze is only meant to connect two people going in the same direction. It also happens to be a way for Alphabet to avoid some of the clunky regulatory barriers that Uber and Lyft have both had to overcome. Waze isn’t Google’s only push into ride-hailing. Alphabet is also working on a service called “Chauffeur,” the Information reports. (Waze has also partnered with Lyft, Uber’s only formidable U.S. rival, in the past.) Google and Uber are working on similar projects in self-driving vehicles, too, and both offer delivery and logistics services—Google through Google Express, and Uber through its food-delivery app, UberEATS, as well as its courier service UberRUSH. Though they’re painted as different services, it’s hard not to draw parallels between the two companies’ carpooling offerings. With Google and Uber both racing to get a foothold in the emerging self-driving-car market, the competition is just beginning.

Just. Stop. It. Google has renamed Google Apps to G Suite. Yeah. Explain that to your users. In this not-really-a-rant rant, David Gewirtz explains how so many product name changes can be a complete and total pain for customers, IT folk, and even purchasing agents. By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | September 30, 2016 -- 12:38 GMT (05:38 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Getty Images/iStockphoto Pop quiz, Hotshot. Is Sierra 10.10, 10.11, or 10.12? Is it Mac OS or OS X or macOS? What's Yosemite and how does that relate to Mountain Lion? Why doesn't iOS have place names, or animal names, or sea creature names? What's the difference between Azure and Microsoft Cloud? What the heck is the difference between OneDrive, SkyDrive, Windows Live SkyDrive, and Windows Live Folders? If you answered "there is no difference," you'd be right. They're different names for the same thing. Why is iMessage called iMessage, when the apps on iOS and MacOS are called Messages? Why can't Amazon's Cloud Drive stay named Cloud Drive? Now it's Amazon Drive. That's okay because Microsoft Office Web Apps became Office Online. Why the heck not, right? Don't even get me started on Google. We had Google Talk and then Google Voice and then Hangouts. Now there's Google Allo? Allo? Can you hear me now? Seriously? So now, where there was Google for Work and Google Apps, Enterprise, we now have Google Cloud. Even though pretty much everything Google was cloud. Okay, fine. No. Not fine. Not fine at all. Because Google Drive has Google's apps. Google Drive is how you access Sheets and Docs and Slides. Google Docs was once two separate applications, Writely and Spreadsheets. Then there was Google Apps which was different from Drive and different from Google Apps for Work and different from Google Apps for Business (which were sort of the same thing). What? The. Frak! Now, forget all that. Scratch Google Apps in all its forms from your confused little brain. Google Apps is now G Suite. Seriously. Suites are frickn' back. G Suite is the new name of Google Apps. Except Google Cloud is the new name for Google for Work (which is Google Apps, but for more people) and Google Apps, Enterprise, which had a comma in its name. Okay. Okay. Deep breath. Get off my lawn! No. wait. This isn't a get off my lawn moment. This isn't just whining on the part of a tech pundit who doesn't want to remember new names anymore. I got this. I read 50 tech news articles every morning. I can keep track of this because it's my job, and we have an editorial guide here at ZDNet. But regular users don't have the time for this crap. Renaming core products has serious repercussions beyond merely my desire to rant. First and foremost, renaming products confuses users. It was hard enough trying to explain that all their files were going to be stored in something called the cloud. Once they got used to that idea, the names of things started to change. Where is their stuff? How do they access their productivity applications? On top of that are all the purchasing, bidding, and procurement challenges, which once used to pay for Google Apps or something like it, and now have to buy G Suite. Do you have any idea how many IT professionals will need to scramble to rename everything, update contracts, and otherwise hold back their justifiable desire for profanity until they reach the safe space of their next therapy session? Classic tech Classic Unix/Linux editor Vim gets first update in years Apple history: First photos of vast collection stretching back to Jobs' and Wozniak's earliest computers The 25 biggest events in Linux's 25-year history From Lemmings to Lotus 1-2-3, you can now relive Commodore Amiga's glory days Before the Apple Watch: A history of smartwatches, in pictures Marketing information, tutorials, books, even the stuff people look for on Google all generate confusion when the names change. Corporate portals have different names from what the product is named now. Do you take the Google Apps course on Lynda.com, or wait until they scramble to rename it G Drive (even though the actual videos won't change for a few months)? I get it. I used to be a product marketing guy. Products and services change. Sometimes the old name doesn't reflect all that the new service can do. Sometimes the name you use ticks off another company, so you have to change it. Sometimes there's a desire to consolidate or create names that align with trends across the industry. Sometimes, products have been around so long that what they were a decade ago is radically different from what they are today, not only in function, but even in business model. Sometimes, it seems like there's a good business reason to change a product's name. But here's the thing: for every good business reason to change the name, there are millions of customers you will confuse. That's the bottom line in this discussion. The customers, the purchasing agents, the IT folks, the training people, the publishers, the writers. All of these people will fall somewhere on the range from inconvenienced to baffled to enraged because you wanted to spruce up your product categories. I'm not saying never change your name. But if you must, please make it make sense. Name changes ideally should be a very rare practice, not something you do each year because it's the only way you can get your various departments to agree on anything. Please stop changing the names of things just to get attention, or to have an excuse for another press release. Remember that this isn't an industry populated by just a bunch of geeks anymore. This is now a mainstream industry. Every time you rename a major product, it has a major impact. Imagine if the engineers at Ford suddenly decided to switch the brake pedal and the gas pedals around. It would cause serious problems. People might die. People won't die because Google has renamed their product G Suite. But the level of confusion and hassle is going to be felt all across the world. If I can leave you with any one thought, it's this: don't rename your products unless it's a life or death situation. If you do, do it only once. Do not rename your products every year or so because it makes you feel good to design a new logo. You have responsibilities now. Real people use your stuff. So cut it out.

Google Maps has gained some new voice controls that will make it easier to control Maps while you drive without having to touch the smartphone. When in navigation or driving mode, say “OK Google.” You can then issue a voice command to have the app do whatever you say without having to tap or look at the screen. When voice commands are available in the app the white microphone will show up in the top right corner. When the smartphone recognizes your “OK Google” command a circle with bouncing dots will be seen on screen. You can issue commands like “OK Google, find gas stations.” If your device won’t respond to the “OK Google” command, you can tap the microphone and then tell the app to find gas stations. You will need to set the app up to work with voice commands. This is done by tapping “settings” and then tapping “OK Google detection.” Users also have to enable the “Always on” setting or the “from any screen” setting. There are multiple voice commands the app will understand including “What’s my next turn?”, “What’s my ETA?”, “Show / Hide traffic”, “Mute / Unmute voice guidance”, and “Avoid tolls / highways / ferries.” There are many more voice commands that Google Maps can understand and Google has a cheat sheet that outlines them all here.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Apps for Work rebrands as G Suite, blog now Keywords By Ida Torres - September 30, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google is streamlining a lot of its products for the past few months and the latest to be “rebranded” is the already ten-year-old Google Apps for Work. Since we are now in the collaboration era when it comes to productivity, the goal now is to help us “work and innovate together” so that our respective businesses can “move faster and go bigger”. So now, they are calling this whole system the G Suite, which is composed of Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Hangouts, etc. Meanwhile, the official blog for everything Google will now be known as Keywords. Most of the stuff that are in the G Suite are things you may probably use already. So the rebranding may not really affect much of your personal workflow. But Google is saying that real-time collaboration will be built into this system, and they will be incorporating changes over the next few weeks into each of the apps included in G Suite. These changes include having better access to files in the cloud storage, a more intelligent way of scheduling on Google Calendar, improvements on Sheets, Docs, and Slides, etc. Meanwhile, Google has around 19 blogs focused on different products from the tech giant. So now they’re streamlining everything into one place and they’re calling it Keyword, “a new destination for the latest news from inside Google, from Android to Translate.” Basically anything new that Google wants to tell you about will be here in one place so you don’t need to follow all of those other blogs. This is good since we were getting a bit confused already. In related news, the whole enterprise platform is now being renamed into the Google Cloud. This includes the Google Cloud platform, enterprise mobility, Chromebooks, and the aforementioned G Suite. We don’t know what other changes this will be bringing, but it will be interesting to see what they will be.

It’s shielded from you because we go digging for the news to bring it straight to your inboxes and notification trays but in reality, it’s a really frustrating endeavour to find out what Google’s up to. This is because the company’s public communication spans a ton of different avenues. News from Google, whether that’s about products and apps, or just updates on their research projects and efforts, get littered throughout 19 different blogs. This is not to mention that they often only announce stuff across multiple accounts on multiple social networks, and some of those announcements come from Googlers’ personal pages. And we’re still not even taking into account newsworthy changes to their services that are only communicated on their support documents, like when new countries support Google Play Music or new banks and credit cards are added to Android Pay. So, you see, it’s been a nightmare for us. And Google is finally looking to change all of that. They’ve launched Blog.Google to streamline all their communication. We’re not sure if the blog will take those odd social media announcements they love to make often, but it should at least pull their 19 blogs into one space. And we’re still probably going to have to dig through support pages for much of the news. Going through the blog in the early going, it’s apparent that not even Google was completely ready for the transition yet. Many of their latest posts redirected to the old blogs, though there’s enough new stuff on the Blog.Google site to let us know that they will be making significant announcements there. And when I refreshed the page, a lot of the redirects were gone and replaced by native entries. So, yay! It’ll be easier to find new stuff from Google for both you and I. Google has separated their content into 2 categories: Product News: Android, Chrome, Maps, VR, whatever. This is where you’ll find news about all the new stuff Google wants you to play with. Topics: Deeper discussion on research projects like AI and health, culture and arts, and the like. Be sure to stop by their new place to take it all in for yourself! local_offer    Google   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (6) stars Further Reading New Google Live Cases available Google accounts suspended for reselling Pixel phones OnePlus 3T charging proves solid Allo gets themes, emoji suggestions, and more Google and Facebook are challenging bogus websites stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

[STUDY] SEO September 12, 2016 SEO Anna CroweSeptember 12, 2016 SEJ STAFF 1.8KSHARES 4.8KREADS 1.8KSHARES 4.8KREADS SEJ STAFFAnna Crowe 1.8KSHARES 4.8KREADS At SEJ, we’ve done hundreds of interviews, polls, and now #SEJSurveySays to learn from other SEO marketers. And, about a month ago, I sent a survey to 215 SEOs to discuss what they are currently working on. Here’s what I discovered. Over the past year, the SEO industry has done a lot of changing. We’ve all had hundreds of conversations at conferences, on podcasts, and through emails to debate the future of search marketing. At our weekly SEJ editorial meetings, our amazing news writers Matt Southern and Danny Goodwin give the SEJ team incredibly valuable insights into the changing landscape of SEO. And, when a new Google algorithm update hits or Facebook updates their metrics, the SEJ team uses it as an opportunity to learn, grow, and share with the SEO community. But one of the biggest challenges we face as an SEO industry as a whole is uniting our efforts and learning from each other. For example, I get tons of emails for new article pitches. Juicy, brilliant, (and sometimes spammy) article pitches that give me insight into the top minds and tools in SEO. And that insight is super valuable. But I haven’t been very good at turning that insight into shareable data that every SEO marketer can use to benchmark themselves. That’s why I decided to put together this survey. On July 28, I sent this email 215 SEO marketers. I was blown away by the response. I expected a few people to write me back, but my inbox quickly began to flood. I listened and learned from other SEOs to get inspired about their current projects they are working on, what their aspirations are, and what future SEO projects they have planned. I surveyed and spoke to the 64 top search and online marketers, agencies, CEOs, and consultants to bring you these insights. I hope you find them inspiring and helpful. Putting Together the SEO Survey First and foremost, I want to give a big thank you to all the 64 SEOs that took the time to contribute to our survey. I know you all have very busy schedules so I’m extremely grateful for your feedback to help make this article. You have all inspired me and motivated me to create new projects and focus on different areas of SEO! Thank you. If you participated in this, I’d love to get your comments below! Also, if you didn’t get a chance to participate in the survey, please fill out the Typeform at the bottom of this post to be a part of upcoming surveys. Since starting this post, I’ve received a few emails and responses to my survey expressing gratitude for putting this together. And, while I put this survey together for my own selfish reasons of wanting to know what others in my field are working on, I’m wishing we could all be more open about what we’re working on daily. It would help all of us — beginner SEOs and seasoned searchers alike — better understand our ever-evolving space and benchmark our efforts. Below you’ll find the questions I asked and the answers I received. I hope you find it as inspirational and actionable as I did. I’m excited to see you all start putting these ideas to use! Here’s how I broke it down… Where is the Majority of Your Time Spent? The obvious first question is: Where is the majority of your time spent? I weighed a number of questions and decided to start with this one first because it felt like a good place to build some groundwork. More than 25% of SEO marketers said the majority of their time is spent on technical and onsite SEO projects. These projects were broken down into three buckets: On-site Off-site Technical Other Other topics included: Writing Research and analysis Management Sales Finding unicorns (thanks 🙌, Larry Kim!) What SEO Tasks Do You Spend Most of Your Day Working On? Almost 72% of people surveyed said they spent most of their day creating quality content. These projects were broken down into: Removing duplicate content Navigation & UX Data (Google Analytics & Google Search Console) Keyword research Creating quality content Building relevant backlinks Editing metadata Mobile optimization Other A few of the other topics people mentioned: Convincing client and development teams to implement SEO strategies. Relationship building with bloggers and influencers. Meetings Email marketing What are Your Biggest SEO Challenges Right Now? Over 28% of marketers surveyed said one of their biggest SEO challenge was building relevant backlinks. The projects were listed as the same above: Removing duplicate content Navigation & UX Data (Google Analytics & Google Search Console) Keyword research Creating quality content Building relevant backlinks Editing metadata Mobile optimization Other Here are a few of the other topics: Implementing optimizations in a timely way. Creating a process that is scalable. Getting company buy-in. Hiring people with the necessary focus and aptitude. Now, let’s hear from the SEO marketers themselves… What are Your Current Aspirations for SEO? Rand Fishkin, Moz: “We’ve lost rankings on many of our most important keywords, and while traffic overall has grown, we’re missing many potential customers we used to capture.” Tim Soulo, Ahrefs: “I believe that SEO starts with your product. If your product is not superior to any other alternatives – then you don’t deserve to rank, no matter how many backlinks you build. But when your product is amazing – people will link to you naturally and you will rank higher and higher in search.” Amy Merrill, Page One Power: “I would like to see content marketing, PR, social teams and onsite content teams and link building teams working more holistically. Ultimately the work being done by each group is part of a complete puzzle, but in many cases, these groups are segmented and not working cohesively which benefits no one.” Eric Enge, Stone Temple Consulting: “I’d like to see the industry better understand how important quality content and backlinks are. It sounds trite and obvious, but it’s crazy how many companies don’t invest in these things.” Bill Slawski, SEO by the Sea: “Understanding how a thematic model and an entity model can work together to improve the quality of a website.” Dan R Morris, Blogging Concentrated: “Our goal is to teach people you can’t “SEO a website”. SEO is a culture you build into your business. It’s not a task. It’s how you operate.” Maddy Osman, The Blogsmith: “I hope that as search engines become smarter, it will be easier to be found for quality content without such a keyword focus. I want to be able to create content that’s 100% for the human, not the machine. Katy Katz, Inturact:  “While there are priorities that are unique to both SEO and content, a lot of the major qualifications for success in these two realms overlap. Today, you cannot be successful at one without the other. It is my hope that businesses will understand the interconnectedness of SEO and content marketing and build a strategy to support it.” Jason White, Dragon Search: “We’re marketing and we should speak in marketing/business terms. Tie tactics to ROI. Keep our client’s best interest first. Empower them to own their own data and not be beholden to a provider.” Rocco Baldassarre, Zebra Advertisement: “Creating quality content that people want to share. That sounds easy but it is very difficult to achieve on a constant basis.” Kristen Glehan, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation: “For there to be greater ease in building a more immediate authority of multiple topic sites, especially on an enterprise level.” Stoney deGeyter, Pole Position Marketing: “Quality work, quantity results.” What are Your Aspirations for the Future of Your SEO Efforts? Chris Berkley, Seer Interactive: “SEO needs to integrate more with CRO, specifically. Several of my clients have relaunched websites and lost conversions because of on-site issues that have nothing to do with traffic or rankings. We can’t just say “that’s not an SEO issue, sorry.” Prashant Puri, AdLift: “To have Google use a more 360-degree approach to qualifying a website. Internally at AdLift, we’re seeing some of this happening. Example: Landing page metrics are being used as ranking signals – however, we’d like to see a deeper integration into social signals.” David Farkas, The Upper Ranks: “I believe links will remain one of the core ingredients to the algorithm for the foreseeable future. And here at The Upper Ranks, we plan to continue building the heck out of them.” Larry Kim, WordStream: “Crazy-high organic click-through rates!” Eli Schwartz, Survey Monkey: “Understanding user intent and building content that matches the intent behind the queries.” Steve Guberman, The Golf Channel: “Mobile! A lot of revenue is derived from our mobile apps. A primary emphasis for the remainder of this year is mobile.” Nick Wilsdon, Vodafone Group: “My aspirations are focused on increasing SEO capability within Vodafone group. That approach helps us effectively work with internal partners, agencies, and suppliers within the SEO program. Only together can we meet the significant digital challenges facing search over the next two years.” Jessica Roberts, Footprint Digital: “My goal is to continue to evolve my content writing and marketing skills to keep up with the ever-changing world of SEO.” Jordan Kasteler, Digital Marketing Consultant: “The future of my SEO efforts will be all about adapting to change but not reacting. Reactions, to new feature releases or statements, from Google, can leave SEOs wasting resources chasing their tale. But waiting for releases or statements to prove themselves worthy, and then adapting, is what the future is about. Otherwise, trend chasers and newcomers may be shooting themselves in the foot.” Joe Hall, Hall Analysis: “To develop more tools and software for the SEO community and my clients.” What Is the Biggest SEO Project You’re Working On? Clint Henderson, WiredSEO: “Central Security Group – We do all their Digital Marketing, they’ve seen 50% rev growth to $91M and just made the 2016 Inc 5,000 fastest growing companies in America. Our goal is to make them into the top 3 security providers in the United States.” Brian Harnish, ymarketing: “Link remediation, link removals for United Healthcare at the agency I work for: ymarketing.” Rachel Standley, Fire Mountain Gems and Beads: “Updating large sections of our existing content to reach a larger search audience.” Chris Campbell, ReviewTrackers: “We are doing an audit of the 1,000+ blog posts to understand how visitors share, engage and read our content. We are utilizing this data to better understand what articles our visitors want to read.” Allison Fabella, Atlanta-Journal Constitution: “Integrating technical enhancements with targeted content initiatives.” Roger Montti, MartiniBuster: “Managing my stable of sites that are in dozens of niches while also launching new projects. It’s like having children. Some need more attention than others.” Amanda DiSilvestro, HigherVisibility: “Content! It’s all about writing content. I’m actually currently trying to get better at creating infographics.” Garth O’Brien, GoDaddy: “Right now we are investigating our entire navigation suite and organizing our content in a meaningful manner.” Ryan Clutter, 1SEO Digital Agency: “My company is set to launch a new website, completely redesigned for the best user experience. I’m working on making sure all metas and titles are in place, while the content fully supports the topic of the page. It’s been a long process of optimizing more than 100 pages of content, but the end is near and I’m excited to see the company reach its goals with both the design of the website and the user experience on each page.“ Markelle Harden, Avista PR: “Guiding content initiatives for companies that have established brands in Europe and are expanding into the US.” What’s the One Thing That has Brought You the Most Results in the SERPs? Daniella Galuppi, Digital Marketer: “Video content hosted onsite.” Julia McCoy, Express Writers: “Adding long-form content (2000+ word blogs) around low competition keywords. Infographics with transcripts have brought us high rankings, too.” Brent Carnduff, Digital Marketer for Real Estate Industry: “The clients that I work with are small firms looking to gain local traction with the search engines. With all of the changes in search and all of the talk of the “death” of SEO, I still find that the fundamentals of SEO are most effective for them. Good on-page SEO and application of keywords have an amazing impact.” Ryan Jones, WTFSEO: “Find out what task my customers are trying to accomplish, then build something that makes it easier for them. Fill the gap that the competition isn’t properly serving.” Larry Engel, Fathom Marketing: “I’ve recently noticed a shift in Google toward showing “utilitarian” results rather than “informational” results. In other words, in our niche, Google used to show results focused on answering the What of the query. Now the search results mostly focus on the How.” Patrick Stox, IBM: “Trying a few different ways to map content by similarity so that I can generate millions of redirects from old pages (pulled from the Wayback CDX Server API) automatically.” Steve Wiideman, Wiideman Consulting Group: “Obsessing about the page performance, not the website performance has brought us the best results over time.” Mike Van Der Heijden, Konnect Digital: “Page relevance. Being able to answer a “query” better than competing websites.” Michael Hodgdon, Infront Webworks: “Local SEO- Understanding local algorithms, partnering with google’s related programs in order to obtain optimum results and stay current with best practices.” Andrew Dennis, Page One Power: “Consistently publishing in-depth, quality content on our blog as well as highly-visible, third-party industry publications.” Shane Barker, Influencer Marketing Consultant: “High authority links with great content.” Annie Singer, Heal That Pain: “I saw a pretty substantial jump in traffic after acquiring about 5 solid backlinks within about a 2-week period.” Adam Riemer, Online Marketing Strategist: “Quality content. By creating really good and engaging pieces we attract a ton of links. From there we build a strong internal linking structure to rank the main site. Quality content isn’t just written words. It’s funny stunts we pull in public to get noticed, it’s being part of an event and also just taking photos of things that people would want to share and link to.” How has Your SEO Efforts Evolved Over the Past Year With the Introduction of Rankbrain, Amp Pages, Etc.? Katina Beveridge, Strategic SEO: “My SEO methods have gone from thinking just about onsite issues and link building to more link baiting and enhancing my digital marketer. knowledge. It is now all about creating content that will please the end-user, google and bring in conversions for the client. We are offering a holistic approach to SEO. and content marketing.” Casey Markee, MediaWyse: “By further reinforcing my long-held belief that the only constant in SEO is “change.” SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. My goal is to educate clients on the role of each of these new strategies and revolutions and devise a path forward that “hopefully” leaves them better off in the future than they are now.” Will Robins, Contenthow: “The secret sauce is amplification (outreach) to get links pointed at those power pages.” Mary Bowling, Ignitor Digital: “Trying to educate clients on the new world order for content, links, and citations. Many – including agencies I consult with – still cling to old-school SEO ideas that are more likely to harm than help in 2016 and beyond.” Jordan Koene, Searchmetrics: “More so than ever before the need to understand how Google is using Schema and data to process rankings is changing the SERP. Take medical cards or carousels, for example, these elements are only available to webmasters who contribute data to Google in order to process it into the SERP.“ Anne Ahola Ward, CircleClick Media: “We are spending a lot of time on AMP and Facebook Instant Articles. It’s been a wild ride, but the hard work is definitely paying off.” Nicholas Chimonas, Page One Power: “Don’t trust the Google hype, test things for yourself. 3xx no longer diminishes PageRank? Then why does updating thousands of 302s to 301s result in an uplift of rankings and traffic? Why does updating internal links from 301s to 200s improve SEO? Maybe here’s where RankBrain or other machine learning is really playing a part; the Google engineers believe one thing when their machine is doing something else.“ Matt McKinley, Media Temple: “The basis of general SEO best practices remain the same but AMP becomes more important depending on the site as mobile traffic grows. In terms of RankBrain, you can’t master a machine that teaches itself, but the fundamentals haven’t changed. As the crawler becomes more advanced, I’m considering user flow data more than ever for navigation/UX.” Kelsey Jones, Search Engine Journal: “More emphasis on mobile, both from a UX perspective and how content is broken up.” Big Wins and Key Takeaways From This Survey The big “win” from these insights of the top minds in SEO is how it is key to market to an audience niche, experiment with different types of content marketing, and continue to build backlinks. This insight is invaluable and critical to the online growth of any company. These insights can have an immediate impact on how businesses approach their SEO strategy and marketing decisions.

Amzad Sati Awesome Survey i would like to agree with Tim Soulo, Ahrefs: “I believe that SEO starts with your product” Newcastle SEO I honestly love the way the email is written out. Just a tiny tip, be human in your emails. Notice how she uses emojis, the smiley face and hilarious picture? I think thats a clue to reaching out. Just something I noticed. But great article guys, avid fan here! Rebecca Spiller Absolutely amazing post – bet it was a lot of effort Anna, but so worth it. I think the part that really stood out for me was this: “Our goal is to teach people you can’t “SEO a website”. SEO is a culture you build into your business. It’s not a task. It’s how you operate.” In fact, there were a few similar but I just enjoy the way that one was worded. It is sooooo true. You can’t just go in and SEO a site (no matter what some agencies will tell you). By creating a resource and something that hasn’t just been designed for Google, you’re far more likely to see results. It’s like so many have this get ranked (or rich or slim) fast mindset and don’t want to put the work in to create something that’s actually worth something. Forget SEO, create a resource that truly helps solve a problem and watch the natural flow of search engine traffic. Phew, that was an essay.

In fact, the policy has been in place so long that it has become a fairly common SEO best practice. So, why is it in the news again today? Google has taken it upon itself to reiterate the policy, specifically warning against “unnatural” links. Unnatural links are those that are built into a widget, and automatically placed on a site unbeknownst to the site owner. Often they contain keyword rich anchor text as well, and the worst part is site owners have no control over it. Even though the site owner may be unaware they’re publishing links on their site in a black hat fashion, Google will still penalize the use of unnaturally placed links. Upon being hit with such a penalty, Google will notify site owners through Search Console. Site owners may also receive warnings if links to their site are automatically included in widgets placed on other sites. If you have a widget out on the web that link back to your site, Google recommends fixing the problem and submitting a reconsideration request. The issue can be resolved by either removing the link(s), or adding nofollow attributes to them. As an added precaution, Google recommends checking all widgets for any unnatural links. If possible, edit the widget to include a nofollow attribute, or remove the link altogether.

There is no specific date for when the Android Wear 2.0 will be released, but Google did explain the delay. They stated that they need the time to make improvements on the OS version as well as hunt for bugs that may get in the way of a flawless wearable experience. Android Wear 2.0 Features, News & Updates Google said on their blog that in order for the Android Wear 2.0 to become a good fit for most wearables, they will continue their Developer Preview 3 until 2017. They noted that they have added Google Play on Android Wear which will make it easier for users of wearables to install apps directly. The Play Store on Android Wear can be used to look for apps in a number of ways. Wearable users can choose to search for apps using their watch's keyboard, voice, handwriting and recommended queries. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit The highlighted advantage that this feature brings in the Android Wear is that users will no longer have to use paired phone apps to be able to use the ones on their wearable if they don't want to. This means that watch-only apps can be directly installed on the wearable without going through the hassle of using a smartphone, making the smartwatch more independent. Bringing the Play Store specifically for the Android Wear 2.0 is Google's response to customer's demand for easier navigation of their apps in their wearables. While looking for apps in the new Android Wear 2.0 may not be as easy as using a smartphone, Google is continuing to develop the feature. How to Install Android Wear 2.0 For developers who want to try out the beta version of the Android Wear 2.0, they will need to use their phone to add a Google Account on their wearable in order to fully test it out. They have written a detailed instruction as well as a link to an emulator for those who don't have a watch. Tech Times noted that the Android Wear 2.0 Preview 3 is limited to certain devices including LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition with LTE and the Huawei Watch. In addition to the Play Store, the Preview 3 also allows testers to look at the new view for the wearable and an easy way to respond for notifications.

BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm Here (http://reut.rs/2dabC1B). Separately Here's Dutch rival TomTom NV on Thursday announced traffic data deals with Volvo Trucks and Skoda. Also General Motors, Nissan and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give carmakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (http://reut.rs/2daj3Wr). Can they really charge for it? However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top carmakers said this week that they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (http://reut.rs/2dcPuCy). Careful driving At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. “We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform,” Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. “Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively,” Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian carmaker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (http://reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Mercedes-Benz, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers that want to go it alone but it still sees some need for collaboration. “We need to think whether we work together analysing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case,” Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships such as the deal between Volvo and Uber to develop autonomous cars, and GM's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. “The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways,” Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters.

Google asks for airspace access for internet balloons Technology Friday 30 September 2016 - 11:59am Sri Lankan men at a tea plantation look at the wreckage of a Google balloon that crashed in the central part of the country in Gampola on February 17, 2016. Photo: STR / AFP MONTREAL - Google, which is hoping to beam the internet to remote areas of the world via balloon, went before the UN's aviation agency to ask member states to let it ply their airspace. The company's X Lab, which was created to pursue big-vision projects, said it hopes to establish a network of helium balloons floating in the stratosphere that will emit a powerful 4G signal to rural and difficult-to-access areas. The new initiative - launched in 2013 and dubbed "Project Loon" - saw its first balloon take off from South America in February only to crash at a tea plantation in Sri Lanka, where it was discovered by villagers. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, had partnered with Sri Lanka to bring the internet to remote areas there. The country's Information and Communication Technology Agency, which coordinated the tests with Google, described the landing as controlled and scheduled. READ: Jozi science teen wins big at Google Science Fair Loon has "significantly improved the balloon design, manufacture and launch procedure," X Lab told the UN's International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Wednesday, according to a document seen by AFP. "The balloons are now robust, remaining aloft well beyond the targeted 100 days, and are launched through a custom developed auto-launcher, allowing rapid multiple launches," X Lab told the organisations' executive committee. After compiling publicly available wind data with its own flight data, Project Loon was able to model the stratosphere's air flow, allowing its balloons to "change altitude to 'catch' the winds moving at the speed and direction necessary to a given service area," the document said. Alphabet requested the assistance of ICAO member states as they met for its 39th triennial assembly, asking them in particular to "establish bilateral or multilateral letters of agreement with adjacent states and Project Loon to allow Loon balloons to safely transit flight information region boundaries." "Safety and coordination with the international civil aviation community is very important to Project Loon," a X Lab spokeswoman told AFP. Loon is currently working to finalise a safety plan and set up its operations centre. In July, leading social network Facebook launched a similar attempt to bring internet access to remote areas via solar drones.   AFP Comment Now!

 Donald Trump is resurfacing an old rumor that Google hides negative search results about Hillary Clinton Avery Hartmans Sep. 29, 2016, 9:23 AM 5,176 facebook linkedin twitter email print Win McNamee/Getty Images Donald Trump thinks Google is suppressing negative search results about his opponent — a conspiracy theory that Google refuted in June. The Republican nominee made the claim while speaking at a rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Wednesday. Here's how Trump told it:  "A new post-debate poll, the Google poll, has us leading Hillary Clinton by two points nationwide and that's despite the fact that Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton. How about that." The claim likely stems from an internet rumor from June that Google was hiding search results that would paint Hillary Clinton in a bad light. At the time, a viral video created by SourceFed showed several autocomplete search results for "Hillary Clinton." One of the examples showed autocomplete results for "Hillary Clinton cri" that included "Hillary Clinton crime reform," "Hillary Clinton crisis," and "Hillary Clinton crime bill 1994," but not "Hillary Clinton criminal." The latter result was the first listed on other search engines like Bing and Yahoo. According to the Washington Post's Philip Bump, the claim was resurfaced this month thanks to a piece published by Russian media organization Sputnik News, which claims to prove the theory is accurate.  But Google emphatically shut down the autocomplete rumor in June. A statement provided by a company spokesperson in June reads: Google Autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how Autocomplete works. Our Autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person's name. More generally, our autocomplete predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms. Business Insider reached out to Google for an updated comment and will update this post if we hear back.
