By Troy Wolverton | twolverton@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 3, 2017 at 9:30 am | UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 8:49 am If you’re looking for an alternative to Comcast for pay TV, you’re soon going to have another option. But how long that option, and others, will survive may be up to federal regulators. On Tuesday, YouTube announced it will be entering the pay TV game. The Google-owned company, best known for hosting free-to-watch videos posted by individual creators or pirated from Hollywood media companies, will soon be offering, for a monthly fee, a collection of broadcast and cable TV channels. YouTube is only the latest company to offer a pay TV bundle distributed over the internet. Over the last two years, Dish launched Sling TV; Sony, PlayStation Vue; AT&T, DirecTV Now; and Comcast, Stream TV.

Net neutrality may be under attack next Google’s upcoming pay TV service won’t be the last internet-based pay TV service. Hulu has already announced that it too will begin offering a multi-channel pay TV service later this year. And Apple reportedly has long been eyeing the market. Excluding Comcast’s Stream TV, which is only available in a few areas of the country and is designed largely for in-home use, the new internet pay TV services are all similar. They each offer the same trade-off: You get far fewer channels than you’d get with a typical satellite or cable TV offering, but you’ll pay significantly less and you can cancel at any time. Unlike many traditional pay TV services, you can watch the new services on the device of your choice, be it a tablet, smartphone, computer or television. And to watch on your TV, you typically only need a low-cost digital media player like Google’s Chromecast or one of Roku’s players; you don’t need to rent a costly cable box. YouTube TV will fit right into that mold. At launch, it will offer some 44 channels, including all of the major broadcast networks except PBS. For that, the company will charge just $35 a month. The service will offer notable advantages over its rivals. It will launch with a cloud-based DVR feature, which will allow users to store recordings of programs on Google’s servers. That’s a function Sling TV is still testing and one that DirecTV Now still lacks. YouTube TV users will be able to record as many programs as they want and keep them for up to nine months. By contrast, PlayStation Vue’s cloud DVR deletes recordings after 28 days and the one Sling is testing will only store 100 hours of programming. Another feature that’s likely to please: YouTube TV users will be able to access up to three video streams from the service at a time. So, you could be watching something in the living room while your spouse watches something else in the bedroom and your kid watches a third show in their room. DirecTV Now only allows two concurrent streams and Sling TV’s base offering only permits one stream at a time. But YouTube TV will have some limitations that may make it unattractive. At least for now, the company is saying that if you want to watch it on your TV, you’ll need a Chromecast device or a TV with built-in Chromecast support. If you have a Roku box or Amazon’s Fire TV or an Apple TV, you may be out of luck. Of course, you can pick up a Chromecast for only $35, so that problem is easily solved. What’s likely to be troublesome are the channel options. YouTube TV will include Fox News, ESPN and USA, which are three of the most popular cable channels. But it will be lacking lots of others. Among the missing: TBS, HGTV, TNT, the Discovery and History channels, CNN, AMC and Lifetime. So if you want to watch “The Walking Dead,” “Project Runway” or “Fixer Upper,” you’ll have to look elsewhere. Still, the launch of YouTube TV is something to be excited about, even if its lineup doesn’t match your viewing habits. After years of being stuck with ever pricier television service from a handful of competitors — at best — we now have a growing number of lower-priced options. If you include not just the multi-channel services, but Netflix, HBO Go and the large number of individual cable channels available online, the market for internet-based TV services appears to be growing and thriving. But there’s trouble on the horizon. The business model for these kinds of video services depends on an open internet. Unfortunately, the open internet is very much in question right now, and the big broadband providers — most of which have their own video services that are under threat from the Sling TV’s and YouTube TV’s of the world — have a strong incentive to see it go away. If broadband providers could block video services that competed with their own or slow down their streams to the point where they were unwatchable, they could put rivals out of business. If broadband providers were allowed to charge rivals a toll to access the providers’ customers or ensure a fast connection to them, they could make those rival services unprofitable or prohibitively pricey. Conversely, if broadband providers, many of which limit the amount of data their subscribers can consume in a given month without facing extra charges, can exempt their own internet video services from those data caps while applying them to their rivals, they could give their own services a leg up. If one service eats into your limited data allotment and another, similar service doesn’t, which one are you more likely to use? Those notions may seem alarmist, but Ajit Pai, the new head of the Federal Communications Commission, has made it clear that he’s no fan of an open internet, at least as it’s commonly understood. He’s already given companies like AT&T and Verizon the green light to exempt their own video services from data caps they apply to their rivals. And in a speech Tuesday, he gave his strongest indication yet that he will seek to roll back the FCC’s strong net neutrality rules, which protect the open internet by preventing broadband providers from blocking or throttling or providing fast lanes to particular sites and services. Without those rules, the FCC would have no power to protect competition in internet video services. So enjoy the new pay TV competition. Shop around, find a service you like. Just be aware, this era of choice may not last.

Just recently in December, it was reported that a malware called 'Gooligan' breached accounts of more than a million users. Now, a bizarre new type of malware has been detected in around 132 apps in Google Play that had the ability to affect Windows users, according to a security firm. Palo Alto Networks discovered the malware-ridden apps and reported them to Google to have them removed from Google Play. The Internet security team in a blog post said that the apps, which were developed by several different people, managed to hide HTML-based iframe tags. The iframe tags, which are generally used to embed external elements in a webpage, like a YouTube video, was also loading elements from malicious domains. In one case, an app didn't use iframe but Microsoft's Visual Basic language to load malicious code into the app. In the report, Palo Alto Networks traces the infected apps to a common geographical location even though the developers are unrelated. Most of the apps are said to originate from Indonesia, since the country's name was attached to the names of the apps. "One common way HTML files have been infected with malicious iframes has been through file infecting viruses like Ramnit. After infecting a Windows host, these viruses search the hard drive for HTML files and append iframes to each document. If a developer was infected with one of these viruses, their app's HTML files could be infected," the report notes. The reports goes on to suggest that the malicious nature of the apps was not intentional and that the developers simply did not realise that their apps' HTML files were infected when uploading their apps to Google Play. Furthermore, the purpose of the malware was to load interstitial ads and the main malicious applications, elaborates Ars Technica. These Windows-specific malware were downloaded from domains that have long since been disabled. So while the apps themselves aren't a threat on Android devices, it still raises concerns on Google's app screening process, and why it failed to identify the infected apps.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest No, Amazon Echo’s ‘Skills’ aren’t the new branded apps Jeff Ragovin, Social Native March 4, 2017 2:33 PM Tags: Amazon Echo, Jeff Ragovin Above: Amazon Echo Image Credit: Amazon Back in early 2009, many brands realized for the first time that iPhone apps could be a branding vehicle. Suddenly, there was a frenzy of activity as marketers rushed branded apps to the marketplace. In 2017, history seems to be repeating itself. In this case, many marketers are quickly building “Skills” on Amazon Echo. Such Skills include ordering a pizza on Domino’s, fetching an Uber, and connecting to your FitBit. In early January, Amazon announced it had 7,000 Skills in its Alexa Skills Marketplace, a 7X increase in seven months. Many of those are branded Skills. For instance, GE is using Alexa as a means to provide voice control for its appliances, and BMW and Hyundai feature Alexa in their vehicles, while LG even lets people control their fridge. Despite the presence of such major brands, though, this isn’t the second coming of the App Store. Voice-control isn’t actually new, for one thing, and its use cases are much more limited than those of standard apps. Skills are less a brand-building exercise than an Echo-building exercise. The zero UI era Alexa is the most conspicuous element of home automation, but the market is growing quickly and will soon include other big players. Google introduced Google Home in November 2016. Apple’s HomeKit lets consumers turn on their lights and adjust their thermostats via Siri. Microsoft is also bringing its Cortana voice-controlled interface into this environment. Juniper Research estimates that the number of connected appliances in smart homes will rise to 20 million by 2020. In this so-called “zero-UI” environment, consumers will interact with brands via their voices, gestures, and facial recognition, among other AI-based technologies. So far, that communication is mostly happening via voice. In this context though, Amazon’s Echo isn’t really anything new. Consumers can get the same functionality from an iPhone with Siri, an Android phone with Google’s voice recognition, and Microsoft’s Cortana. In fact, you can place any recent-vintage Windows laptop on your kitchen counter and do everything you can do with Echo, including order a Domino’s pizza. Chances are you won’t, though, because you’d probably rather see what you’re ordering. That’s one major problem with voice-only interfaces: They are lousy for shopping. Imaging trying to find a new pair of shoes, for instance, by listening to Alexa read back descriptions. Voice control is also awkward to use in public and is still glitchy enough to get things wrong. Last year, J.D. Power said voice-control dashboard interfaces were the No. 1 problem for motorists. The future for voice control While voice control will invariably improve, it’s unlikely that consumers of the near future will use Alexa to call on their favorite Skills. As with smartphones, they are likely to either use generic commands like “order me a pizza” or “check my bank balance” and have Alexa fill in the relevant brands. That’s a huge opportunity for Amazon, but the company will be vying with Google, Apple, and Microsoft, among others, all of whom are working to build out voice-based search. None of those companies have yet offered a competitor to Amazon’s Skills, perhaps for good reason. Unlike Amazon, those companies don’t have to support a cute device that so far is a novelty rather than a necessity. At this point, Skills are more a value-add for Echo than a full-blown ecosystem like the App Store. That could change, but even in the App Store, most branded apps don’t get a lot of traction. In the future, when consumers talk to brands, they’ll be calling on Alexa, Google, Siri, and Cortana. The rest will be on their own.

'Bounty Hunter' Can Expose You By KI MAE HEUSSNER Nov. 1, 2010 0 Shares Email Star PlayABCNEWS.com WATCH Conversation: Cyberbullies and Trolls 0 Shares Email He has been called a bounty hunter for the digital era, and for good reason. After Michael Roberts' own name was smeared across the Internet by an online antagonist, crushing his successful business and threatening personal relationships, Roberts made it his mission to help other victims of online defamation rout out the anonymous Internet trolls trying to upend their lives. The Australian native launched a Las Vegas-based company called Rexxfield, dedicated to digital forensic analysis and online reputation defense. (Nevada was chosen as the home base because its state laws are more favorable for those suing for libel damages.) Play null Since starting the firm in 2008, Roberts said he has helped more than 150 people unmask their online attackers. His firm boasts an 80 to 90 percent success rate for positively identifying anonymous Internet posters. He recently launched the non-profit FreespeechV3.org, a pro bono arm of his company, to give victims of online defamation even more support. By the time people contact him, they've been branded whores, child abusers, liars and other vicious epithets on the Internet. They're spirits are so deflated, some consider ending their lives, he said. nullPlay null "You can hear it in the voice of the people when they first contact you," he said. "And once the problem is solved they're like a different person." Billionaires, Royalty Among Those Looking to Expose Anonymous Online Harassers Roberts counts billionaires and royalty among his clientele and two of the most recent high-profile cases involving unmasking anonymous posters were ones in which he was involved. A couple of weeks ago, one of his pro bono clients, Carla Franklin, succeeded in obtaining a court order from a New York judge instructing Google to identify people who posted defamatory content about her on YouTube. nullPlay null Another pro bono client, Vogue cover model Liskula Cohen, made headlines last summer when she successfully sued Google to uncover the name of an anonymous blogger who slandered her online. But how does this modern-day bounty hunter track down his prey? Roberts said it often starts with the Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the unique number assigned to any device connected to the Internet. IP Address Is 'Smoking Gun,' Online Investigator Says "That's the smoking gun that inexorably links the offensive posting to the address – not the person, of course, but the address," he said. Play Rutgers Students Remember Tyler Clementi With Weekend Vigil When someone goes online and posts a comment on a website or writes a blog post, an IP address connects the computer he or she is using to a physical address. That IP address is logged both by the Internet Service Provider and by the website hosting the content. It's the key piece of information that can pierce the so-called veil of anonymity online, but Roberts said that there's one problem: It's perishable information. "The moment somebody posts their smear or their diatribe, the clock starts ticking," he said. In most states, the statute of limitations for Internet libel for civil relief is one year, he said, although a few states extend the limit to two or three years. And, he added, ISPs, search engines and other websites regularly purge their systems of IP address logs. nullPlay null But IP Address Is Often Not Enough They aren't required by law to store the information for any specific amount of time, so they set their own policies governing the deletion of files. Roberts said that from his experience, ISPs tend to delete IP information after about six months; Web companies, such as Google, tend to hold on to information for longer. The information held by the ISP, however, is actually more critical, he said. While an IP address stored by a website might be able to lead a forensic expert to the ISP that enabled the Internet connection, the IP address held by an ISP can actually lead the expert to an Internet troll's front door. But Internet companies don't just hand over these keys. A subpoena and, in some cases, a court order, are necessary to force the companies to release the IP addresses. Even after Roberts obtains the requested IP addresses, his job is not always finished. "So many cases fail, whether it be harassment, wire fraud, whatever it might be, because it's like a doorway we know the person walked through, but so did 100 other people," he said. An IP address can tell him where the poster's computer may be located, but it doesn't absolutely link a specific person to that computer. To identify the individuals behind online attacks, Roberts said he uses a combination of high-tech expertise and old-fashioned instinct. Digital Forensics, Linguistics Help Identify Online Attackers "We have to triangulate the individual with digital evidence that can't be obtained electronically," he said. Assuming a victim has a sense of who might be behind the attacks (which they often do, he said), he and his specialized team reach into their black box of tricks to map out the individual's social network. Using what he called "social forensics," they figure out the person's friends, most frequented sites and habits online. "They leave lots of electronic footprints," he said. In 75 to 85 percent of the cases, those tactics are enough to positively identify the perpetrators of online attacks, Roberts said. But in some cases, he goes a step further, enlisting a Ph.D.-trained forensic linguist. "[She] can examine known samples of writing with the anonymous writings and link them together with the little idiosyncrasies in the person's prose," he said. While Roberts does take on several cases on a pro bono basis, he said, most cases cost about $5,000 to $10,000 (not including legal fees which, depending on the circumstances, can significantly inflate the price). But his clients say that the expense is worth it. Patty McPeak, founder of natural products company Nanacea, said that after she left her previous company, where she had been CEO, online commenters wrote vicious posts about her and her family. The ordeal continued for about two years, but Roberts' company helped expose the commenters. And when McPeak let them know that she had learned their identities, the online onslaught stopped. At 69-years-old, she said, she had no desire to spend her golden years suing them, but just knowing who was behind the attacks was enough. "I would have gone to my grave wondering who would have said such awful things about me," said McPeak, who lives in El Dorado Hills, Calif. "I have such peace of mind knowing who these people are. It would never have been possible without this." 0 Shares Email Star Comments Internet 'Bounty Hunter' Goes After Digital Trolls +Great Pumpkin: Secret to Growing Giant Gourds +Why Do We Like to Scare Ourselves?

Photo: screenshot News media companies in developed countries all over the world are struggling with the consequences of digital disruption: declining profits, too much news available for free online and global giants like Facebook and Google gobbling up much of the advertising revenue.    In the New Zealand Herald last weekend, Fran O’Sullivan - the head of business for NZME (the Herald’s publisher) said it was time for a Kiwi solution to the problems here.  Our government had shied away from taking action on offshore online titans Facebook and Google siphoning off the advertising revenues, she said, while South Australian senator Nick Xenophon has been pushing for rules to make them pay local media producers.  “In the same way that Facebook and Google have made billions out of being innovative businesses, we need to find innovative ways to make them pay back a fair share of their profits to the companies they are taking content from,” Senator Xenophon recently told The Australian newspaper. Protecting traditional media companies is crucial democracy and open debate, he said. Last year the Canadian government commissioned independent think-tank The Public Policy Forum to ask experts and the public what should be done. It raised the issue like this in an online video, with a strangely jaunty soundtrack. Last month the Public Policy Forum put forward its conclusions in a report called The Shattered Mirror: News, Democracy and Trust in the Digital Age. The Canadian government expected to respond to these proposals by middle of the year. Among its recommendations is a 10 per cent withholding tax on advertising carried by foreign digital media. This, the PPF said, could bring in more than NZ$400 million a year to add to a similar fund for Canada’s media which already harvests a five-percent levy on cable, satellite and online video-on-demand services. In Canada, Facebook and Google have - predictably - hit back at the idea.   Professor Michael Geist is world authority on technology law from Canada’s University of Ottawa.  "Making the advertising on popular digital services more expensive penalises the companies looking to advertise," Professor Geist  - who also writes for the Toronto Star newspaper. "Media companies in digital transition have come to depend upon these ad networks," he said.  The PPF also urged the Canadian government to place its advertising with only Canada-based companies. "If you want government advertising and public service messages to be effective, it would be crazy to advertise only in certain media knowing you were going to exclude a certain segment of the population. People 18-25 are not watching the 6 or 10 o'clock news." he says. The Shattered Mirror report also suggested tightening up copyright law to prevent news created at great expense by one news outlet being lifted or copied by others online  - as happens all too often these days.

"We depend upon multiple organisations to get parts of a story. We don't want to silo our news world," he said. Some countries have pursued so-called "link taxes", imposing a cost on online republication. "You end up with media organisation suddenly finding readership declining significantly because they are pretty dependent on search and social media services to drive traffic," he said.  "If we view (the media) as a significant priority, it is reasonable to use tax dollars. Even if some people object, it is cleaner than taxes, levies or tinkering with the costs of other essential services," said Prof Geist.   These issues are also being addressed here in New Zealand by the Peoples' Commission on Broadcasting and Media. This new group is holding meetings around the country and plans to present a report and recommendations for reform to the government in May. It is also seeking submission from the public. Full details can be found here: www.makeourmediabetter.org.nz/   Tags: internet media technology Canada Facebook Google Public Policy Forum Shatterd Mirror media policy Embed Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Google Plus Share on Reddit Share on Linked In To embed this content on your own webpage, cut and paste the following:

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Caught in another Controversial Story about Supporting Slave and Child Labor in Congo | Main | Apple Still in the Hunt for a Transformative Acquisition to set Apple TV on Fire Prior to the Arrival of the Mobile TV Revolution » March 04, 2017 Apple Struggled in the Education Market in 2016 as Schools on Tight Budgets Chose Chromebooks   Back in 2014 AppleInsider's editorial writer and digital assassin Daniel Dilger took the Financial Times to task on the subject of Google Chromebooks overtaking Apple in Education. Since that time stories have kept piling in with the same conclusion that Google's Chromebook was the top computer used in the classroom. USA Today, 9to5Mac, CNBC, Fast Company and others kept that story front and center over the years along with the statistics to backup those claims. This week the New York Times weighed in with a report titled "Apple's Devices Lose Luster in American Classrooms," based on new education market statistics from Futuresource.   The NY Times report starts off dramatically by stating that "Apple is losing its grip on American classrooms, which technology companies have long used to hook students on their brands for life.   Over the last three years, Apple's iPads and Mac notebooks — which accounted for about half of the mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States in 2013 — have steadily lost ground to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on Google's Chrome operating system and are produced by Samsung, Acer and other computer makers.   Mobile devices that run on Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems have now reached a new low, falling to third place behind both Google-powered laptops and Microsoft Windows devices, according to a report released on Thursday by Futuresource Consulting, a research company.   Futuresource noted in their report that of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States in 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, up from 50 percent in 2015.   School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said. Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource told the Times that "Apple is struggling." For more on the NY Times report, click here.   Google's Chromebook Continues to Win   Futuresource's report that was published on Thursday noted that "Sales of Mobile PCs into the US K-12 sector continued to develop in 2016, with annual shipments growing 18% year-on-year in 2016, reaching 12.6 million units, up from 10.7 million in 2015. The outlook for 2017 is also positive with market shipment growth forecast to remain in double figures."   The number one platform in education was from Google. Their strengths were a "strong combination of affordable devices, productivity tools via G-Suite, easy integration with third party platforms/tools, task management/distribution via Google Classroom and easy device management remains extremely popular with US teachers and IT buyers alike. The rise of Chromebooks has also set new industry benchmarks with regards to average device pricing, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects."   The Rise of Hybrid Tablet-Notebooks   The last point of interest is the report's position on hybrid devices for this year. "It is the area of '2-in-1' devices (devices that can be utilised both as tablets and with an integrated keyboard for productivity applications) that are expected to be the major competitive area in 2017.   Both Microsoft and Google (and their respective partners) have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300.   The 2-in-1 form factor is ideal for education, providing schools with flexibility in usage. In addition, the technology behind stylus/pen usage has developed rapidly and 'inking' is expected to become widespread and add value to device usage.   Mike Fisher, Associate Director of Education at Futuresource Consulting, added that "PC provider's laser focus on the education sector is good news for schools and students. 2017 will see wide ranges of computing devices, designed specifically for education and at competitive price points, entering the market and vying to be the device of choice for learning."   Though for most school districts it's about tight budgets and this is where the Chromebook usually gets the nod.   Last year Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple and IBM have launched their First MobileFirst App for Education Called 'Watson Element'," showing that many schools are looking for deeper educational tools and more advanced devices like the iPad.   Considering that the top Fortune 500 companies and now leading medical facilities around the U.S. like Stanford Medicine are using the iPad, many schools will want to ensure that their students are familiar with tools that industry leaders prefer.   Not every school wants to work with bottom of the line tools and so Apple will continue to introduce new iPad models later this year with more software to assist educators prepare their students for the real world.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

This information was confirmed by Google's senior vice president of hardware, Rick Osterloh. Talking about the device, Osterloh said "You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now. There is an annual rhythm in the industry, so you can count on us to follow it." The current generation Pixel devices weren't received well for their premium pricing. On that Osterloh had to say "Pixel stays premium." Google is currently facing inventory issues with the current Pixel phones, causing it to not be able to have the phone in stock most of the time. Hopefully the company irons out these issues by the next one.

Live Watch 'Insert Coin': Google Doodle Celebrates Pac-Man's 30th Anniversary By KI MAE HEUSSNER May 21, 2010 0 Shares Email Star Courtesy Google To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the classic video arcade game, Google unveiled its first-ever interactive doodle ? a playable Pac-Man 0 Shares Email Pac-Man is back. And to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the classic video arcade game, Google has unveiled its first-ever interactive doodle – a Pac-Man game that Web users can play straight from Google's homepage. On May 22, 1980 the now-iconic Pac-Man game was released in Japan by Namco Bandai Games. Originally called Puck Man, Pac-Man launched in the U.S. in October 1980 and went on to sell more than 100,000 units in its first year of production. Play Pac Man marks 30th anniversary The name of the game comes from the sound of eating, according to the official Pac-Man website. "Paku" is the Japanese sound for "chomp." Now the game is listed by Guinness World Records as the world's most successful coin-operated game. To help recognize the pop culture mainstay, at 11 a.m. ET today (midnight in Japan), Google turned its homepage over to a Pac-Man game that can be played for the next 48 hours. Visitors can click on the "insert coin" button or wait 10 seconds to automatically start the game, which reaches 256 levels. "Google doodler Ryan Germick and I made sure to include Pac-Man's original game logic, graphics and sounds, bring back ghosts' individual personalities, and even recreate original bugs from this 1980's masterpiece," said Marcin Wichary, senior user experience designer at Google and co-creator of the Pac-Man doodle. "Pac-Man seems like a natural fit for the Google homepage. They're both deceptively straightforward, carefully hiding their complexity under the hood. There's a light-hearted, human touch to both of them." To celebrate the anniversary, Namco has released championship editions for Apple's iPhone and iPad. Google posted its very first doodle in 1998 and its first animated doodle earlier this year to celebrate the birthday of Sir Isaac Newton (it showed an apple falling from a tree). Other popular Google doodles have recognized author H.G. Wells, the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and the changing seasons. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Google Doodle Celebrates Pac-Man's 30th +Tweeting Tchaikovsky on His Birthday +Google Doodle Mystery Solved: Happy Birthday, H.G.

Sign up Now. Google last week released its E2EMail encryption code to open source as a way of pushing development of the technology. "Google has been criticized over the amount of time and seeming lack of progress it has made in E2EMail encryption, so open sourcing the code could help the project proceed more quickly," said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. That will not stop critics, as reactions to the decision have shown, he told LinuxInsider. However, it should enable the company to focus its attention and resources on issues it believes are more pressing, King added. Google started the E2EMail project more than a year ago, as a way to give users a Chrome app that would allow the simple exchange of private emails. The project integrates OpenPGP into Gmail via a Chrome extension. It brings improved usability and keeps all cleartext of the message body exclusively on the client. E2EMail is built on a proven, open source Javascript crypto library developed at Google, noted KB Sriram, Eduardo Vela Nava and Stephan Somogyi, members of Google's Security and Privacy Engineering team, in an online post. <a href="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=007a712380&amp;cb=14888801427861" ><img src="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538762539&amp;cs=007a712380&amp;cb=14888801427861" border="0" alt="" /></a> E2EMail Unwrapped The early versions of E2EMail are text-only and support only PGP/MIME messages. It now uses its own keyserver. The encryption application eventually will rely on Google's recent Key Transparency initiative for cryptographic key lookups. Google earlier this year released the project to open source with the aim of simplifying public key lookups at Internet scale. The Key Transparency effort addresses a usability challenge hampering mainstream adoption of OpenPGP. During installation, E2EMail generates an OpenPGP key and uploads the public key to the keyserver. The private key is always stored on the local machine. E2EMail uses a bare-bones central keyserver for testing. Google's Key Transparency announcement is crucial to its further evolution. Google Partially Benefits Secure messaging systems could benefit from open sourcing the system. Developers could use a directory when building apps to find public keys associated with an account along with a public audit log of any key changes. Encryption key discovery and distribution lie at the heart of the usability challenges that OpenPGP implementations have faced, suggested Sriram, Nava and Somogyi in their joint post. Key Transparency delivers a solid, scalable and practical solution. It replaces the problematic web-of-trust model traditionally used with PGP, they pointed out. "Google announced end-to-end email encryption almost three years ago, and no product or solution ever materialized," said Morey Haber, vice president of technology at BeyondTrust. "With this announcement, Google is making good on the promise of a Chrome extension that would seamlessly encrypt Gmail end-to-end," he told LinuxInsider. Since Google decided to open source the project, the technology will not remain proprietary for Chrome and Gmail, Haber added. Instead, Google no longer is working on this project, and the community will own the work and any potential derivatives. "This could be viewed as coming clean on a 3-year-old promise, or the release of a market perceived vaporware project. In either case, the techniques being used might spur some other innovation for similar messaging-type solutions," added Haber. Last Ditch Effort Google's decision to drop E2EMail and release it to open source might be the company's way of saving face, suggested Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. The best-case scenario is that sharing the project might inspire other developers and possibly improve security in general, he told LinuxInsider. "I think, like a lot of Google projects, Google lost interest in this one," Enderle continued, "and putting into open source is a way of at least allowing others to benefit from the effort. It is better than just shuttering the effort and archiving the work in a private repository." The impact of Google's decision to open source the project is difficult to assess, noted King. "Google has admitted that the issues surrounding end-to-end email encryption are far more complex that it originally assumed, so the code it has released is far from fully baked, he said. That makes its actual value hard to determine, King added, but bringing additional eyes and energy to the effort could help it progress more quickly. Solutions Still Needed About half of the email that traverses the Internet does so unencrypted, although that may not be the case for messaging and social media apps, suggested BeyondTrust's Haber. "Basic implementations of technology like this can be used to secure everything from banking statements to password resets," he said. Although Google's project never materialized into a product, the ideas and methodologies are good examples to learn from. "It will help educate people on techniques and potentially failed projects related to end-to-end encryption," Haber said, "but in the end, there are big problems to solve with key management and SHA1 collisions that researchers and security engineers should be focusing on."

Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Concordia Summit Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, considered one of the leading candidates for chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, has over the course of his campaigns received more than $60,000 in contributions from tech companies such as Facebook, Microsoft and Google. That means if President Donald Trump appoints Reyes to the FTC, there’s a chance Reyes would have to recuse himself from cases involving those companies, according to a source close to the FTC. Other FTC experts said the federal agency had little or no experience in dealing with commissioners who have received campaign contributions and if that would put him under pressure to recuse himself from cases. It’s still unclear if ethics regulations would apply in the case of campaign contributions, but experts say the issue for Reyes would come down to any appearance of conflict. As Utah’s attorney general, Reyes reported $2.2 million in campaign contributions going back to his first campaign in 2012, according to the office of the Utah Lieutenant Governor. He received roughly $1.9 million of those donations between 2014 and 2016. Of contributions between 2014 and 2016, he received a total of $25,000 from Facebook, $15,000 from Comcast*, $7,200 from Microsoft, $3,000 from Yelp, $2,500 from Google and at least $10,000 from a batch of other tech companies, according to campaign finance disclosures. Google and Yelp declined to comment for this story. Comcast and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment. Facebook directed Recode to its political engagement report. What makes this a potentially unusual circumstance for the FTC is it typically hasn’t seen former politicians serving on the agency. If appointed, Reyes’ past political life could complicate FTC cases going forward. Reyes’ campaign consultant, Alan Crooks, told Recode, “We haven’t reviewed any of those things at this time,” referring to the contributions from tech companies. “We’ll take a look at it if he’s actually called to be FTC chair.” The FTC declined to comment for this story. The commission is one of two key federal institutions, alongside the Department of Justice, with the authority to pursue antitrust action against companies, making it a focal point in watching how the Trump administration handles regulatory policies and actions of significance to the tech industry. Reyes gained attention after sources told Politico he was a top candidate for the role of chairman of the commission. Acting chair Maureen Ohlhausen has also gained support as a possible permanent appointee. Both are Republicans. In recent years, lobbyists have aggressively pursued attorneys general with campaign contributions to act in favor of their corporate clients, according to a 2014 investigation in the New York Times. The draw is that attorneys general typically face fewer restrictions and disclosure requirements than other elected officials. A commissioner involved in cases pertaining to companies that contributed to his political campaigns would create “an appearance of impropriety,” a source close to the FTC told Recode. “The issue of running campaigns and the political contributions that are part of those campaigns presents some unique issues for the Federal Trade Commission in terms of recusals on the one hand, and in terms of appearances on the other hand,” this person said. But another source, a Washington D.C. lawyer who used to work for the commission, told Recode campaign contributions are “just part of the fabric of our political system.” The person pointed out that appointed roles at other federal institutions have been filled by former politicians. Hillary Clinton, for example, was appointed Secretary of State after serving as senator from New York. “Suggesting that there’s a problem with this is really taking on the issue [of campaign contributions] generally,” the source said. This isn’t the first time questions have been raised about Reyes having an appearance of bias regarding tech companies. As attorney general, Reyes signed a letter a year ago suggesting the FTC revisit an investigation closed in 2013 into whether Google unfairly skewed search results to favor Google products. In the run-up to the nomination of an FTC chairman, companies engaged in conflicts with Google, including Yelp, have made efforts to promote his appointment, according to the Wall Street Journal. It should be noted that in addition to taking money from Google, Reyes has also taken money from Yelp, which has criticized Google for what it sees as anticompetitive practices. Whether Reyes would be pressured to recuse himself in cases involving companies that have contributed to his campaigns depends on an interpretation of the Code of Federal Regulations. The code’s ethics standards for executive branch employees requires them to “avoid an appearance of loss of impartiality” in doing their jobs. Failure to avoid the appearance of bias could result in a court decision being tossed, according to Wayne State University law professor Stephen Calkins, who served as general counsel to the FTC in the late ’90s. “At some point an affected party could claim that due process rights were violated,” he wrote in an email. In Reyes’ case, if the rule applied, Calkins said it would likely involve a part of the code which he describes as “vague, more general.” The line states: “An employee who is concerned that circumstances other than those specifically described in this section would raise a question regarding his impartiality should use the process described in this section to determine whether he should or should not participate in a particular matter.” A previous FTC commissioner recently recused himself in cases involving Google, but for different reasons. Joshua Wright, who left the FTC in 2015, recused himself from matters involving Google because he had accepted funding from the company for some of his previous research papers. The Law and Economics Center at George Mason University, where Wright was a professor, received $762,000 in donations from Google from 2011 to 2013, according to Salon. But Wright’s recusal likely stemmed from a different part of the federal code and may not apply to Reyes, according to Calkins. It’s difficult to predict how ethics standards would be applied to Reyes because the FTC has rarely, if ever, had to consider ethics surrounding campaign contributions, Calkins said. Historically, it’s rare for the commission to appoint members who have held elected office. Seattle University School of Law professor John Kirkwood, who worked for the FTC for 25 years, said he couldn’t recall a single commissioner who had previously been an elected official. “I doubt the FTC has much, if any, experience deciding whether a political contribution requires recusal,” he wrote in an email to Recode. Calkins identified one commissioner who held a seat in Congress before joining the FTC — John Gwynne, who was appointed to the commission in 1953. Calkins did not look into earlier commissioners. Reyes has faced questions about the impact of campaign contributions on his actions as attorney general in Utah. In 2015, critics raised concerns about a $5,000 contribution Reyes received from contact lens company 1-800 Contacts, which benefited from a law he was defending. Reyes’ campaign consultant Crooks told the Associated Press the contribution was consistent with past donations from the company, and that Reyes was required as attorney general to defend any laws passed in the state. The company, 1-800 Contacts, is currently fighting a lawsuit waged against it by the FTC alleging anticompetitive practices, as the New York Post previously reported. * Comcast’s NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Vox Media, which owns Recode.

The new Assistant is Google’s version of Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon’s Alexa. Although late into the AI game, Google Assitant has one major advantage over every other AI-based digital assistant software: the Google/Android connection. Google, who has been branching out of its humble search engine beginnings for years, bought Android in 2005. This seemingly simple move allowed Google to expand from desktops to smartphones. According to Quartz, Android hit a record-breaking 88 percent of the smartphone market last year. Android’s success can be attributed to partnering with many smartphone manufacturing partners, while Apple’s IOS has a much smaller market share since it is only available on Apple devices. However, the Google Assistant was not supposed to be used throughout the entire Android universe. Google’s initial strategy was to roll out the Google Assistant on Pixel (Google’s high-end smartphone), and Google Home. Google changed their strategy when Amazon’s Alexa made it even easier to shop online. Since Shopify reports that retail eCommerce sales are projected to grow to over 3.4 trillion US dollars by 2019, Amazon clearly wanted to capture a larger piece of that ever-growing market. Amazon pushed to install Alexa in a wide variety of IoT products was Google’s motivation to change tactics, as reported by CNBC. “The U.S. technology giant’s move comes after Amazon continues to aggressively push Alexa onto new devices. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa would be integrated with LG refrigerators and even Ford cars. But it began to step on Google’s feet when Amazon announced that Alexa would be on the Huawei Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S., which runs Android. “Amazon has taken an early lead with Alexa and Google needs to exploit the enormous reach of Android smartphones to rapidly get the Google Assistant into the hands of consumers before they get wedded to the Alexa ecosystem.” [Image by guvendemir /iStock] The race to dominate the AI market quickly forced Google to tap into its huge Android market. According to a report by Pocket-lint, Google has confirmed Google Assistant will be available for Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow phones, including: Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge HTC 10 HTC U Ultra LG G5 LG V20 Sony Xperia XZ Huawei P9 Google has also released Google Allo, a messaging app that uses Assistant technology. This would allow more Android phones to use Assistant, again increasing Google’s share of the market. One slight issue, according to a CNET review, is that “Allo doesn’t integrate video calling, and it doesn’t have as many features as its competitors, like baked-in GIF support or control over read receipts.” [Image by Eric Risberg/AP Images] As technology changes and evolves, the innovations will continue to push the envelope and try to find new ways to connect with consumers. Google is the king of connecting consumers and businesses. Google’s search engine is designed to be incredibly helpful while selling advertising. Now that technology allows us to shop, search, talk, and work anywhere, tech companies will keep installing AI in places that will increase profits. By 2021, the number of internet-connected devices is predicted to reach 46 billion. In the race to become the leader of voice-activated AI, Google has a clear advantage in its huge Android market. With an 88% of the smartphone market, Google should be the clear leader. However, 9TO5Mac reports that “Apple made more revenue from iPhone in a single quarter than Google has ever made from Android.” So while Google is poised on the brink of dominating the market with its new Assistant, Google’s Android advantage may not be enough to squash its competitors.

What a week! The annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) took place in Barcelona from Monday to Thursday, and there was no shortage of big announcements at that event – but there was plenty of exciting news and developments across the rest of the tech world too. If (somehow!) you’re not familiar with MWC, this quick video intro from the beginning of the week should give you some idea of what it’s all about: If you struggled to keep up with everything that’s been happening this week, don’t worry – 7 Days is here again to walk you through the week’s top tech news. There’s a lot to get through this week, so let’s waste no more time! The new BlackBerry KEYone was among the many new devices unveiled at (or immediately before) MWC. The $549 upper-mid-range Android 7.0 handset was designed and built by TCL, which referred to it as a 'flagship', although it doesn't have the specs to match rival flagship-class handsets from other manufacturers. There's plenty to like about the new device, though - and you can get a first look at it in my hands-on video from the launch event (I hope you like videos, because there's lot more of them coming up!). Reports have since emerged of up to three more BlackBerry-branded devices on the way this year, including photos of one with a very different design to the KEYone. In off-camera conversations at the KEYone launch event, several BlackBerry staff hinted to me that a 'true' flagship is in development, possibly with a Snapdragon 835 processor. The stunning new LG G6 also made its debut at MWC, featuring an unusually wide 5.7-inch Quad HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Along with a stylish metallic body, it also features a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB RAM and up to 64GB storage, along with IP68 dust- and water-resistance and a fingerprint sensor. I'm already a fan of this device, especially its dual 13MP rear cameras which are capable of snapping some great shots. Check out my hands-on video with the LG G6 here. Huawei introduced its new P10 and P10 Plus flagships just before MWC at a rather poorly organized event which left hundreds of journalists standing outside the venue for hours, long after the event had already begun. During the announcement itself, Huawei spent around half an hour talking about the many colors of the new handsets, so perhaps those of us left outside were the lucky ones. Nonetheless, the new P10 family are beautiful handsets with plenty of high-end specs, and a new version of Huawei's dual-camera technology co-engineered with imaging specialists Leica. You can find my hands-on video for the P10 here. Alongside the P10, Huawei also announced the Watch 2 and Watch 2 Classic, its new Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches, which include IP68 protection, a dazzling array of color options and all sorts of premium specs and features. The Watch 2 also includes integrated 4G LTE connectivity. Nokia was one of the biggest stars of MWC this year - quite a turnaround from what appeared to be the end of its mobile ambitions following the sale of its devices business to Microsoft in 2014. Among its many announcements in Barcelona, Nokia revealed that it's killing off the Withings brand for its wearable devices, in favor of its own brand. The Nokia 6 Android smartphone - designed and developed by HMD Global, built by Foxconn, and sold under the Nokia brand - launched in China in December. At MWC, HMD announced that it will soon be launching the 6 internationally, priced around €229 EUR. HMD also unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5, its new entry-level and mid-range handsets, respectively. You can view the full specs for both devices here, and as I discussed in my hands-on video with the two new Android smartphones, they appear hugely impressive - especially considering their relatively low prices. But the biggest attraction at Nokia's MWC stand was a blast from the past. HMD announced a new version of its much-loved classic phone, the Nokia 3310, updated with a range of more modern features. Every time I visited or walked past the Nokia stand, it was packed with people of all ages - including those too young to remember the original - wanting to get their hands on the new 3310. As you'll see in my hands-on video with the device, it's far from perfect - but there's a lot to like about it. It even includes a new version of the old-school Snake game, which is also coming to Facebook. Archos showed off its new low-cost Android 7.0 tablet. Despite being aimed at budget-conscious buyers, the 101 Saphir offers some rather nice features, including dust- and water-resistance, and a rugged design offering some protection against drops. Samsung had already confirmed that its new Galaxy S8 flagship wouldn't appear at MWC, but the company did announce the launch date for the new handset. And the leaks about the Galaxy S8 just keep coming - new images have emerged twice in the last few days. Samsung revealed its new rugged Galaxy XCover 4 smartphone with a 5-inch 720p display, IP68 rating, and MIL-STD-810G impact protection. It will ship in Europe with Android 7.0 onboard from April, priced around €259. Samsung also introduced a new version of its Gear VR headset, co-developed with Oculus, featuring a new controller with improved navigation. Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S3 made its first official appearance at MWC too. The high-end Android tablet has a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and 32GB storage, along with a keyboard cover and S Pen stylus support. And Samsung showed off its new Windows 10 2-in-1, the Galaxy Book, which comes in two configurations: a Windows 10 Home model with 10.6-inch LCD and 7th-gen Intel Core m3 processor; and a Windows 10 Pro version with a 12-inch Super AMOLED display and 7th-gen Core i5. Both models support 4G LTE and come with a keyboard and S Pen stylus. You can get more info on both variants in my hands-on video here. Porsche Design revealed its new premium Windows 10 laptop. Unlike Samsung's Galaxy Book - which is a tablet with detachable keyboard cover - Porsche Design's new Book One is an actual notebook (albeit with a detachable display!). It's conceptually similar to Microsoft's Surface Book, and features Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Panasonic showed off its latest Toughbook, an ultra-rugged Windows 10 detachable that's waterproof and has a briefcase-style carrying handle. It's packed full of the latest high-end specs - but it will come at quite a high price. Alcatel introduced its Plus12 Windows 10 2-in-1 aimed primarily at business buyers on a budget. It features some pretty modest specs, but - as you'll see in my hands-on video - it also has one of the worst keyboards I've encountered for some time. Alcatel's Idol 4S with Windows 10 has been available in the US for months, but the company finally announced its European launch this week, priced at €599. For some reason, the device has been rebranded as the 'Idol 4 Pro' for Europe, but the Windows 10 Mobile flagship's features are identical to those of its US counterpart. Image via PC World Our friends over at PC World spotted a refreshed version of HP's Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship that had accidentally appeared on its stand at MWC. However, when I went down there to check it out, the company had removed it from view, and its staff rather joylessly refused to say anything about it, brusquely parroting the phrase "we haven't announced anything". Still, HP did announce new accessories for the Elite x3, as well as revealing the Pro x2 612 G2, a premium 12-inch 2-in-1 targeting enterprise customers. The Elite x3 also received a firmware update this week, bringing performance improvements and camera optimizations. Lenovo unveiled a range of new Android devices aimed at families, including some features designed with kids in mind... ...as well as a selection of new Windows 10 devices covering a wide range of price points. The Miix 320 - which is priced as low as $199.99 USD - was my personal favorite, offering some very nice features, along with rock-solid build quality. But the new additions to the Lenovo range include a 14-inch Yoga 520 notebook, and two flagship-class Yoga 720 convertibles with stylus support, stylish design, and beautiful displays. You can get an overview of all four of those new Lenovo Windows 10 devices in my hands-on video. Lenovo's rather lovely new G5 and G5 Plus mid-range smartphones were revealed at MWC too. They offer a decent set of specs combined with some thoughtful design features, along with stylish looks. The G5 was one of my personal favorites at MWC - you can see my impressions of both handsets in my hands-on video. Sony revealed four new Xperia devices in Barcelona, including two high-end handsets, the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZs. The Premium features Sony's Motion Eye camera technology which offers slow motion video capture at up to 960fps. But perhaps the most exciting device on Sony's stand was the Xperia Touch, a €1,500 EUR device running Android 7.0 that projects its user interface onto a flat surface, turning it into a 23-inch touch display. The projector is portable too, but it currently offers just one hour of battery life. Find out more about that device in my hands-on video here. Jolla announced that it has added support for its Sailfish OS on some of Sony's Xperia devices. The company also revealed plans to build a local mobile OS aimed specifically at China. Chinese manufacturer ZTE revealed its new Blade V8 Lite and Mini handsets, offering lesser specs in a more affordable package than the Blade V8 Pro that it announced at CES in January. Xiaomi showed off its new Mi 5c featuring the company's own Surge S1 processor, along with 3GB RAM, 64GB storage and a 5.5-inch display. Xiaomi also introduced its new Redmi 4X, a low-cost smartphone with Qualcomm's latest mid-range Snapdragon 435 chipset, and a very spacious 4100mAh battery, priced from as little as $102. Meanwhile, General Mobile debuted the GM6, the latest handset to launch under Google's Android One initiative. While the new devices were the major focus of attention at MWC, they weren't the only big announcements at the show. Meizu, for example, revealed its new Super mCharge battery technology with a live demo in which it charged a flagship phone with a 3000mAh battery from 0% to 100% in just 18 minutes. And in a year when 'the next big thing' was the subject of endless discussion at MWC, the International Telecommunication Union released a draft report detailing the specifications of the next-generation 5G mobile standard, promising 20Gbps download speeds and latency as low as 1ms. Image via Shutterstock The GSM Association, which hosts the Mobile World Congress expo each year, published its annual Mobile Economy report, in which it estimated that there will be five billion mobile users by mid-2017. Moving on from MWC, fresh details emerged this week of Apple's plans for its 'Anniversary iPhone', which is due to arrive later this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the new handset will include a curved AMOLED screen along with USB Type-C support, while a separate report suggested that Apple is investing heavily in augmented reality technology for the device. Nvidia announced details of its new GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU, with a whopping 11GB of GDDR5X memory. Pre-orders opened on Thursday, and deliveries will begin on March 10. The Raspberry Pi Foundation marked the fifth anniversary of its original maker board by announcing a new variant of the ultra-low-cost Raspberry Pi Zero, which now features 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 for just $10. Elsewhere, an intrepid developer built a Raspberry Pi wearable device running Windows 98 (!!). Developer Michael Darby said: "I thought, wouldn’t it be ridiculous and awesome to have Windows 98 on my wrist?" Yes, Michael - "ridiculous and awesome" is the exact phrase I would have chosen. Love it! <3 "Hello, computer" There was much rejoicing among Star Trek fans in January when Amazon added 'Computer' as a wake-word for its Alexa digital assistant. Now, the company is apparently preparing to add new capabilities to Alexa, including voice calling functionality. Google has started to bring its digital Assistant to millions more Android devices, after initially limiting it to its Pixel phones, Android Wear devices, and its Home speaker hub. And the long wait for Google Home to launch in the UK will soon be over. The company announced that it will launch there in June, although pricing hasn't yet been revealed. There's been some confusion surrounding the future of Google's Pixel laptops running Chrome OS. At a roundtable with reporters at MWC, Google gave the clear impression that it would not launch any more of its own-branded Chromebooks - but a few days later, it stated that its Pixel laptops aren't dead after all. However, Google did confirm that it will definitely be launching new Pixel smartphones later this year. Google's Nougat update continued to slowly make its way to more devices around the world in recent days: Droid Turbo 2 on Verizon gets Android 7.0 update Android 7.0 begins rolling out to the Moto G4 and G4 Plus in the US You can now sign up for the Honor 6X beta program to get Android 7.0 Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta finally heads to the Nexus 6P OnePlus 3 and 3T get Android 7.1.1 beta in China (HydrogenOS) and other markets (OxygenOS) Microsoft updated its Arrow Launcher for Android to version 3.0, calling it the "biggest release yet", bringing new features and major performance enhancements. A couple of days later, it rolled out beta version 3.1, bringing support for Android tablets. We got a small taste of what might have been for Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile flagships, as a series of screenshots revealed support for unique gestures originally intended for inclusion on the Lumia 950 and 950 XL - some of which may have been developed as part of the stillborn Lumia McLaren project. Skype for Linux emerged from the alpha phase of its development with the release of a new beta that included all sorts of improvements and new features. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced that it is discontinuing its Skype WiFi service at the end of this month - and it's not yet clear what the future holds for the separate Microsoft WiFi offering. Microsoft Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains more or less stagnant, while Chrome has extended its lead from 57.94% to 58.53%, according to the latest data from NetMarketShare. NetMarketShare data also showed zero growth (in fact, a very slight decline) for Windows 10, while Windows 7's share of the desktop market grew from 47.20% last month to 48.41% this month. A similar picture was painted by the latest usage stats from gaming platform Steam, where Windows 10 usage declined by almost 1% in the last month, while Windows 7 increased. A new version of Windows 10's iconic 'hero' desktop wallpaper was spotted in the latest build of Windows 10 Cloud - and there's some speculation that the updated version may be unique to the Cloud SKU of the OS. A Windows 10 Cloud build that leaked earlier this week included the ability for users to download and install Win32 apps from the Windows Store. The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will include the option to prevent users from installing any apps except those downloaded from the Windows Store, in an effort to improve on-device security. Microsoft outlined details of new controls over Windows Update that will be introduced with the Creators Update in the next few weeks. These will include more granular controls for when to schedule updates and associated reboots. Thanks to Microsoft's new Unified Update Platform, or UUP, future updates for Windows Insiders could see download sizes reduced by up to 65%. It's been a busy week for Windows Insiders, with numerous new builds being released. After Windows 10 build 15046 brought new features to PCs in the Fast ring on Tuesday, Microsoft rolled out build 15048 to Fast ring PCs on Friday, along with build 15047 to Windows 10 Mobile devices. Build 15043 also made its way to Windows 10 Mobile handsets in the Slow ring on Thursday - the first Slow ring build for those devices since December. On top of that, Windows 10 SDK Preview build 15042 was released on Wednesday... ...along with ISOs for Windows 10 build 15042 for PCs. Microsoft introduced Wake-on-LAN support for its Surface devices when used in conjunction with a Surface Ethernet adapter or dock - a very welcome addition, and rather a long time coming! Microsoft also announced general availability of Visio Online on Wednesday, following several months in public preview. Coinciding with that announcement, it also added a couple of new features. The Movies & TV app on Windows 10 (known as Films & TV in the United Kingdom) was updated for Windows Insiders to include support for 360-degree video, along with some other improvements. However, in less welcome news, Microsoft slashed its OneDrive storage allowances on Wednesday. The company had previously announced plans to remove its 'unlimited' storage plan, blaming customers for using too much of their unlimited allowance. All customers who previously had an unlimited or 10TB allowance will now see their storage reduced to just 1TB. Here's everything you need to know about the implications of those changes. And Microsoft announced a further change on Wednesday, ditching its Windows Holographic brand in favor of 'Windows Mixed Reality'. The new name sounds rather bland in comparison to the old one, but it was a necessary change, given that the virtual reality headsets that run the OS offer none of the 'holographic' elements available on augmented reality devices like HoloLens. Microsoft confirmed to Neowin on Wednesday that it will be bringing mixed reality experiences to both its current Xbox One consoles, and to its new Project Scorpio console, in 2018. It will begin shipping mixed reality dev kits this month, including a headset manufactured by Acer. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced its new Xbox Game Pass, a $10 monthly subscription offering unlimited access to over 100 games for Xbox owners. The new service will be launching this Spring, and you can check out all the games that will be available on day one here. Xbox One Insider Preview build 15039 was released to the Beta ring last weekend, while build 15045 made its way to the Alpha ring on Tuesday with several new features. Build 15046 was pushed to the Alpha ring on Thursday with various fixes for a range of issues. Over 1,000 games are currently being created by developers under the ID@Xbox program; on Wednesday, Microsoft announced details of 22 of those games that are coming to both the Xbox One and Windows 10. Battlefield 1 is free to play this weekend for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, and will also be available to buy with a hefty discount. But after a wonderful and exciting week, our odyssey across the tech world ends this week on a truly sad note. Last weekend, gamer Brian Vigneault died in the final hours of a 24-hour gaming marathon. He was live-streaming his gaming session on Twitch in an effort to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which arranges memorable and happy experiences for terminally ill children. 22 hours into his marathon, the 35-year-old took a break from the stream, but never returned. Brian had previously raised over $11,000 for non-profits during the course of five years as a charity live-streamer. The thoughts of the whole Neowin team are with his family and friends. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Timi Cantisano reviewed the unusual GPD WIN, a handheld computer with a built-in QWERTY keyboard, and gaming controls, including a direction pad, thumbsticks and ABXY buttons. That's definitely worth a read! Byron Hinson published his review of Sniper Elite 4, which is available on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. The game isn't for the squeamish as it can get a bit gory at times, but Byron found it to be a lot of fun, although it can become a bit repetitive. Check out his full review here. And after an action-packed week at Mobile World Congress, crammed full of big announcements, we're eager to hear your thoughts on what was revealed at the event.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google Home Multi-User Support, Amazon Voice-Activated Alexa Camera In The Works Corazon Victorino International Business TimesMarch 2, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share It appears Google is working on a new feature for its voice-activated smart speaker Google Home. A teardown of its latest update reveals multiple account support is underway. Meanwhile, Amazon could be releasing a voice-activated Alexa camera soon.  On Thursday, Android Police reported about what it found after looking into the APK of Google Home’s latest update. The teardown revealed a couple of empty strings that act as placeholders for what Google is working on. The prefix “mu” — short for multi-user — in the names of these strings provide proof that multi-user is coming to the device soon. The Android-centric news site claims the strings would soon be used to launch a feature that would allow consumers to add multiple accounts to Google Home and possibly set up voice recognition profiles for the users.  Although these strings are clearly suggesting multi-user support, there is no telling if Google will push this feature to its smart speakers anytime soon. For now, Google has added support for Google Home users to view the list of alarms and timers set on the speaker via the Home app. Users can access the list from a smartphone and do some changes to the alarms and timer from there. Meanwhile, Amazon is now rumored to be developing a different kind of AI hardware. AFTVnews exclusively reported about a small home security camera it found on Amazon’s website.The site claims that this camera could be Amazon’s new creation that is going to rival the Nest Cam. Unlike the latter, the device could be running the Alexa AI assistant, making it a smart camera instead of just being an indoor security camera. The camera that AFTVnews spotted appears to have 4 infrared LEDs for night vision. Surrounding its camera lens is a blue light ring that’s reminiscent of the light ring on the Amazon Echo. Atop the device are two holes that are believed to be microphones. And, of course, it has built-in speakers. Given all of these specs and features, it’s not that hard to imagine that Amazon could be introducing a smart camera soon.  Google HomeMore Google Home could get support for multiple accounts soon.

Live Watch Loch Ness Monster on Google Earth? By KI MAE HEUSSNER NED POTTER Aug. 28, 2009 0 Shares Email Star Google.com Loch Ness spotted on Google Earth. 0 Shares Email Millions have traveled to the shores of Scotland's Loch Ness, hoping to catch a rare glimpse of the world's most famous lake monster. But earlier this week, a British man revealed that he spied the legendary Loch Ness monster while searching Google Earth from his very own home. Jason Cooke, 25, a security guard from Nottingham, England, told the U.K.'s Sun that he spotted the monster while scanning the site's satellite imagery. Play null "I couldn't believe it. It's just like the descriptions of Nessie," he said. The first recorded sighting of the monster was nearly 1,500 years ago when a giant beast is said to have leaped out of a lake near Inverness, Scotland, and ate a local farmer. Since then, the myth of the Loch Ness monster has only magnified. In 1934, a London doctor snapped a photograph that seemed to show a dinosaur-looking creature with a long neck emerging from the water. Then a home movie from 1960 showed a strange figure swimming in the water behind a family picnicking, although British intelligence later analyzed the film and concluded the figure was likely "something inanimate." Of the millions of people who have looked into Loch Ness searching for something within, about 1,000 visitors have reported unusual sightings. Unfortunately for Nessie-trackers, the "monster" spotted by Cooke looks an awful lot like a boat. But if you'd like to check it out for yourself, enter the following coordinates in Google Earth: Latitude 57°12'52.13"N, Longitude 4°34'14.16"W. ABCNews.com has gone to the ends of Google Earth (and Maps) to explore some of the most interesting images left behind by Google staffers, artists, Mother Nature and a few pranksters as well. The Loch Ness "monster" is only the latest wonder to surface. Here are a few other favorites, from the serious to the frivolous. Google on Moon Not content to have become one of the most powerful information sources on this planet, engineers at Google recently conquered the Moon. To mark the 40th anniversary this year of Apollo 11, Google's engineers partnered with NASA to add a new layer to their popular -- and free -- mapping program, Google Earth. They inserted a detailed map of the lunar surface, as imaged by U.S. satellites. It becomes especially rich in material at the six sites where U.S. astronauts landed between 1969 and 1972, and where various robotic probes touched down in advance of Apollo. To use it, one has to download the newest version of Google Earth, found HERE. It is separate from (and more detailed than) the lunar maps already found on the Google Web site; those have been there for about four years. "I believe that this educational tool is a critical step into the future, a way to both develop the dreams of young people globally, and inspire new audacious goals," wrote Anousheh Ansari, the sponsor of the Ansari X Prize, and the first woman to travel in orbit as a space "tourist," on Google's blog. "Finally, outer space doesn't seem so far away anymore." Heart-Shaped Lakes and 10-Foot Snakes Arizona's Oprah Maze She's one of the biggest stars on the planet, so it only makes sense that she has a special place in Google Earth, too. Arizona's Schnepf Farms carves a maze with the outline of a famous person into its 10-acre cornfield each year around Halloween. Larry King, Jay Leno and Steve Nash are among the celebrities who have been recognized in this way. In 2004, Oprah Winfrey was the farm's celebrity of choice. Heart-Shaped Lake Google's Frank Taylor and Google Sightseeing's James Turnbull said there's a lot of love on Google Earth. They've compiled whole collections of heart-shaped things seen from space, as well as a handful of visible marriage proposals. This heart-shaped lake in Ohio is just one of several like it found by members of the Google Earth community. Man Walking His Snake Leon Kidd, 25, was photographed carrying his 10-foot boa Nibblez along a road in Norwich last summer, the U.K.'s Telegraph reported Wednesday. Norwich is one of 25 U.K. cities included in Google Street View, which lets users see cities and neighborhoods virtually from their computers. Kidd, who owns five snakes, told the Telegraph that walking his boa is regular activity. "I take her out nearly every day in summer in Earlham Park," he said. "A lot of people are surprised, others are curious and ask if they can touch her. She loves being taken out, especially going in the grass." "I didn't even notice I was being photographed by the Google car," he said. "Then about three weeks ago my cousin phoned me and said I was in the newspaper." Firefox Crop Circles In a bid to generate some PR buzz for the Web browser in 2006, some Firefox fans made a gigantic Firefox logo in a crop field. According to the Google Earth blog, the project involved significant planning, building of the crop stompers, GPS devices and a helicopter (to capture the aerial photo). This crop circle is one of a large collection of crop circles visible through Google Earth. Jesus in the Sand Dunes In 2005, the Google Earth blogs were chattering about reports of the face of Jesus in Peruvian sand dunes. Some say they don't see the resemblance to Jesus Christ, but others still wonder about the origins of the hazy image. Googling for Gold Los Angeles musician Nathan Smith believes a 19th century Spanish galleon laden with gold and silver is buried on a ranch in south Texas. He is convinced he found its location using Google Earth. The only problem now? If the ship does exist, it is buried on private property. The family that owns the land doesn't want anyone digging up their property for a ship no one has proved even exists. Citing Maritime Law, on Land "It has been my experience, more times than not, a legend like this, there is some basis of truth," Smith said. "Because it has been around long enough that they have named it Barkentine Creek. That alone makes me think that there was, or is, something buried out there." A barkentine is a kind of sailing ship. Smith has brought the landowners to federal court in a case titled Smith vs. Abandoned Ship, and has argued he has the right under maritime law to dig up a ranch he doesn't own looking for a ship no one is sure exists. Lost City of Atlantis? Using the latest version of Google Earth, which allows users to peer under the sea, a British engineer believed he spotted the lost city of Atlantis off the coast of Africa, about 600 miles from the Canary Islands. The image on Google Earth appears to show a grid-like pattern, which some have said resembles a planned city. The ancient city was first mentioned by the Greek philosopher Plato, and legend holds it sank into the sea. The exact location of the city, and whether such a place even existed, has obsessed treasure hunters for centuries. Google, however, had a much less exciting explanation for the undersea pattern. "It's true that many amazing discoveries have been made in Google Earth, including a pristine forest in Mozambique that is home to previously unknown species and the remains of an ancient Roman villa," a statement from Google read. "In this case, however, what users are seeing is an artifact of the data collection process. "Bathymetric [or sea-floor terrain] data is often collected from boats using sonar to take measurements of the sea floor," the statement added. "The lines reflect the path of the boat as it gathers the data." Pool Dipping In the summer, Google Earth helped British teenagers start a new craze: pool dipping. The cunning teens used Google Earth to find homes with pools and then organized pool parties using social networking sites. This led a police representative to tell the U.K. Telegraph, "We are advising owners of swimming pools to be on their guard and extra vigilant. We would also warn prospective swimmers that using someone else's pool is trespassing and therefore illegal." Street Party The street view in Google Maps typically shows the humdrum life of U.S. intersections and alleyways, but two Pittsburgh artists, with the help of more than 100 co-conspirators, threw a street party for the entire Internet in May 2008. Timing various public performances along one street, Sampsonia Way, as a Google-owned car drove by snapping pictures, the artists, Ben Kinsley and Robin Hewlett, were able to create a montage of spontaneous performances. Google had already shot its Pittsburgh street views, but agreed to come back to shoot the art installation. The company said it wouldn't guarantee that it would use the new images, but when Kinsley looked, there they were. ABC News' Nick Watt contributed to this report. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Loch Ness Monster on Google Earth? +Latest Google 'Wonder' Out of This World +Snake Stroller Joins Google Earth Wonders " New satellite imaging allows unprecedented tracking of lightning strikes Europe launches latest earth observation satellite German court to rule in refugee's Facebook lawsuit Business group: China tech plan threat to foreign firms Pennsylvania Senate Democrats resist ransom in cyberattack Scientists tweak seat cushion material to clean oil spills Zap Map: Satellite tracks lightning for better heads up " World's 1st woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, turns 80 Fitbit tracks your steps; now it wants to chart your Zs, too " House Republicans unveil Obamacare replacement plan " Exxon announces expansion program, Trump takes credit US setting up missile defense system in South Korea " North Korea, Malaysia step up dispute over Kim's death " Wedding ring attached to beads thrown in Fat Tuesday parade " Texas grandpa builds amusement park in backyard " Pregnant woman re-enacts giraffe livestream wearing mask " These mushers brave ice, snow and freezing temps to compete in Alaska’s Iditarod dogsled race " Journalist throws up during plane proposal to girlfriend " Young couple finds it 'freeing' to travel the country in a converted van " Dobby the newborn giraffe gets plasma treatment to bolster immune system

You can find the island on Google Maps, just south of the equator in the Pacific Ocean. Sadly, the actual island isn’t displayed on the map; it’s just a point in the middle of the ocean. You can leave a review, though. The company has done some fun stuff with its maps before, bringing its Street View cameras into the Batcave (Ben Affleck Edition), into Doctor Who’s TARDIS, and to Harry Potter’s Diagon Alley.

That’s according to the company’s SVP of hardware, Rick Osterloh, who revealed the big news during a press event at Mobile World Congress earlier this week. The company is set to reveal the Google Pixel 2 later this year and will remain a “premium” device. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” Osterloh commented. “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” Rumours of the Google Pixel 2 first emerged earlier this year, with the device expected to feature a number of hardware improvements on the first-generation device.

It’s rumored that Google is carrying out several tests at the moment with different processors, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and specialised Intel hardware. Despite the latest update, Google is set to feature renewed smartphone competition in the coming weeks, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 both set to launch in the not too distant future. The Samsung Galaxy S8 release date is still weeks away, but now a major new leak has revealed everything you could want to know about the new phone. Having already been the subject of multiple leaks and countless rumours, the entire Galaxy S8 specs sheet has now emerged online. Revealing all the inner workings of the upcoming iPhone rival, the leaked specs sheets has confirmed the eagerly awaited handset is going to be something truly special.

Kicking things off with the screen, the S8 looks set to be a visual delight with a 5.8-inch QHD panel set to boast a stunning 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. This panel will curve around both the phone's left and right hand edges and will be squeezed in to a phone with near identical dimensions to last year's 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 thanks to a new edge-to-edge design made possible by killing off the physical home button on the phone's lower front edge. Elsewhere the phone, which like its predecessor will be water and dust resistant, will play host to a 12MP dual pixel primary camera and a new 8-megapixel selfie shooter that'll be enhanced by its own integrated flash. That's not all the front camera will be capable of, either. Partnered with a new iris scanner, the phone will be capable of being unlocked just by looking at it, with the camera helping read the unique pattern within your eye.

By By Marisa Kendall, San Jose Mercury News Feb 28, 2017 at 3:12 pm | Print View SAN FRANCISCO — Still reeling from claims that its leaders failed to respond to sexism and inappropriate behavior in the office, Uber on Monday dismissed one of its senior executives after learning he had been accused of sexual harassment while working at Google. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick asked Amit Singhal, his vice president of engineering, to resign after learning about the Google incident, an Uber spokeswoman said. Singhal on Monday denied the allegations and said he left Google for other reasons. The leadership shakeup comes at a time of crisis for Uber, as the $68 billion ride-hailing giant continues to face intense national scrutiny after a former engineer earlier this month alleged in a post on her website that the company protected a manager who propositioned her for sex. In an emailed statement, Singhal acknowledged he had been accused of sexual harassment while at Google, but denied that was the reason he left the company in February of last year. “Harassment is unacceptable in any setting,” he wrote in a statement sent through a New York-based media relations company. “I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior. In my 20-year career, I’ve never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own.” Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before joining Uber just over a month ago, Singhal spent 15 years as Google’s senior vice president of search. He is largely credited as one of the brains behind the company’s search capabilities. He left Google in February 2016, saying in a public goodbye note that he wanted to focus on philanthropy and spend more time with his family.

M Tuesday, Mar 07 2017 | Updated at 04:38 AM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Mar 04, 2017 12:54 PM EST By Donna Mills, UniversityHerald Reporter Google Assistant’s Deeper iOS Integration; Instructions On Proper Installation Via APK Google Assistant may be deeply integrated into Apple's iOS devices in the near future. Android owners need to have the latest version of Google Play services (APK v. 10.2.98 or higher) to get the virtual assistant. (Photo : Ramin Talaie/Getty Images) Android devices running Marshmallow and Nougat are now receiving Google Assistant, an intelligent personal assistant that can sustain conversations. Google Assistant is also expected to make its way into Apple's iOS devices soon. Google Assistant was initially exclusive to Pixel and Pixel XL handsets but is now supporting 32 percent of Android phones (or 500 million Android handsets) in the market, AndroidCentral reported from Google's official announcement of the virtual assistant on YouTube. That includes the latest handsets from Huawei, LG, Sony and Motorola, among others. Android Wear 2, Google Home, Android TV and Android Auto will receive the functionality, too. Users don't need to seek approval from phone manufacturers and carriers to have Google Assistant. They only need to long press their device's home button to activate it -- a process similar to Google Now's. Android owners, however, need to have the latest version of Google Play services (APK v. 10.2.98 or higher) to get the new feature. The rollout will continue throughout this week, so don't worry if you still don't have the virtual assistant as of this moment. For those of you who don't know the exact Google Play services version that your Android device needs, download Play Services info or check out your handset's Settings - Apps - Google Play services. Once there, take note of the three-digit sequences enclosed in the parentheses. Play Services info is an app created by a third-party developer called Weberdo. The app displays the version of Google Play services running on your device, and also indicates if there's a new version available for download. The new version is shown via a link to APK mirror or Google Play. iOS users who want another virtual assistant aside from Siri can also get Google Assistant. Gummi Hafsteinsson, Google's product management director, hinted at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) this week that they are planning to deeply integrate the feature to iPhones. Hafsteinsson didn't exactly confirm the company's plans, but shared that they want the functionality to become "available to as many people as possible, AppleInsider reported. Google Assistant is already available -- albeit in a limited capacity -- in iOS devices via the Allo app. It's possible that the virtual assistant will be added to the iPhone's official Google app, but anything more than that will likely be blocked by Apple.

Gadget Hacks Android Hacks WonderHowTo Gadget Hacks Next Reality Invisiverse Driverless Null Byte Android Basics Glossary of Terms Galaxy S8 Rumors HTC 11 Rumors Everything Pixel Rooting Guide Gaming Roundups Forum Stay Secure How-Tos News How To: 10 Things Google Assistant Can Do to Make Your Life Easier By Dallas Thomas Yesterday 9:22 AM 10 Things Google Assistant Can Do to Make Your Life Easier By combining years of web search advancements, natural language processing, and even DeepMind's artificial intelligence, Google Assistant hopes to change the way you interact with your devices. If you're familiar with Google's previous services, Google Assistant is like Google Now, Voice Search, and Now on Tap rolled into one service, with an extra layer of personality added on top. The end result is one central location for all of your Google needs, be it web search, screen search, playing movies and music, or even booking a reservation at your favorite restaurant. How to Use Google Assistant Google Assistant works on a myriad of devices—it just depends on how you want to access the service. Google Home First up, if you'd like to interact with the Assistant using nothing but your voice, there's Google Home, a direct competitor to Amazon Echo, with a price of $129. It's a small device with two microphones and three speakers, so you can plug it in, place it on your coffee table, then ask Google Assistant any question by starting with the trigger phrase "OK Google." Google Home is Wi-Fi-enabled, so it can even interact with other connected devices like your Chromecast or Android TV, and smart home products such as Phillips Hue light bulbs or Nest thermostats. Order Google Home for $129 from the Google Store Android Devices For a second way to access Google Assistant, you'll soon be able to simply long-press the home button on any Android device running Marshmallow or higher. Once you do that, you can fire away with voice commands and dictate questions, and the Assistant will show results right on your screen. On top of that, this interface will even scan your screen to pick up on keywords you might be interested in (similar to Now on Tap) before you ask any questions. Previously, Google's own Pixel phones were the only devices with this functionality, but a software update rolling out right now is bringing Google Assistant to Android devices running Marshmallow or Nougat with Google Play Services. Google Allo Finally, Google Assistant can be accessed from any mobile device (even an iPhone!) by way of the Google Allo app. This is a messenger service at heart, but it's got a direct line to the Google Assistant. You simply start up a chat thread with @google in Allo, then interact with the Assistant as shown below. On top of that, Allo integrates the Google Assistant with your regular conversations, so it will even pop up with help and information when you're talking with friends. Install Google Allo for Android from the Google Play Store Install Google Allo for iPhone from the iOS App Store (1) Starting a conversation with Google Assistant in Allo. (2) Interacting with Google Assistant. (3) Google Assistant integrated into regular conversations. #1: Search Your Screen The first cool thing you can do with Google Assistant is search your phone's screen, and is exclusive to Android phones and tablets. To use this feature, simply long-press your home button when there's something on your screen that you'd like to learn more about. From here, swipe up on the Google Assistant page, and you'll see relevant info about the things on your screen. This is a perfect way to learn more about a movie, book a table at a restaurant, or quickly Google something that appears on your screen. (1) Triggering Google Assistant via home button long-press. (2) Swiping up to access the Screen Search results. (3) Google Assistant provides info about items on the screen. Images via Google #2: Answer Questions with Google's Knowledge Graph The main thing that makes Google Assistant so "smart" is Knowledge Graph, a feature that Google has been working on for years now. With traditional Google search, these are those results that provide details and answers instead of just a list of links. Example of a Google search Knowledge Graph (highlighted). Since Google Assistant is more voice-based rather than text-oriented, these Knowledge Graphs make the Assistant far more approachable. When you ask a question, Assistant will read this information aloud to actually answer your question—and in cases like Allo, even provide quick links for related searches like Twitter accounts. #3: Carry on a Conversation As well as Google Assistant answers one-off questions, it isn't until you start up a conversation with Assistant that it starts to show its natural language-processing strengths and contextual awareness.

Just ask "What is this called," then Google Assistant will use your location as a context clue to realize what you're talking about, and instantly provide the answer—Cloud Gate. But then, if you press on a bit, Google Assistant becomes a bit more conversational. Follow up your first question with "Who made it," and Assistant will realize you're talking about Cloud Gate based on the fact that you just asked about the sculpture. These same principles apply to all of your dealings with Google Assistant, so it's a truly conversational experience. #4: Get a Daily Briefing of Your Schedule Google Assistant will ask for permission to access data from your Google account, and if you opt into this service, the Assistant becomes all the more powerful. It can then use various sources of information like appointments from your Google Calendar and upcoming events from Gmail to provide a daily briefing. When you wake up, just say "Good Morning," or "What do I have to do today," then the Assistant will give you a rundown of what's on your day's docket. Weather, meetings, reminders, and other events will be relayed, so you can start your day off on the right track. #5: Play Music With Google Home, the Google Assistant can serve as a central hub for all of your media. Just connect your supported music streaming account (Google Play Music, Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn, YouTube Music, or iHeartRadio) during initial setup, then say "OK Google, play <song/album/artist>" to fire up the tunes. Google Home turns Google Assistant into your own personal DJ. Image via Google #6: Cast Videos to Your TV Another great Google Home feature is its ability to connect to Google Cast-enabled devices like Chromecast or Android TV. If you have one of these connected to your local Wi-Fi network, just ask Google Assistant to "Play <movie/show/video> on my TV." The Google Home device will automatically connect to your Google Cast-enabled device to start playback on the big screen—and this same trick even works with music or photos!

The only requirement for this one is that you've uploaded your pictures to Google Photos, which uses artificial intelligence to make all of your media searchable. Don't Miss: How to Upload Your Existing Pictures to Google Photos Just ask the Assistant to "Show me pictures I took in Colorado," for instance, then it will respond with a list of photos taken at that location. It can even find specific objects or people, so it's an easy way to find the right picture to share. (1) Google Assistant finding my pictures of Boulder, CO. (2) Assistant even recognizes my cat! #8: Make Dinner Reservations, Buy Movie Tickets & More Google Assistant is still new, and thanks to its DeepMind artificial intelligence backbone, it's still learning. Some of the first useful tasks Assistant was able to perform were making reservations at your favorite restaurant, and reserving tickets to a blockbuster movie. But now you can even hail a ride through Uber or order food directly from Google Assistant, and there's more features sure to come as other third-party partners jump on board. (1) Restaurant reservations. (2) Movie tickets and showtimes right in Google Assistant. #9: Get Directions With all of the cool places you're bound to learn about while using Google Assistant, it's nice that you can easily ask for directions. Many times, you'll see a Knowledge Graph card with a quick link for directions embedded right along with other info—just tap the Google Maps logo to get started. Otherwise, if you'd just like to know how to get somewhere, simply ask Assistant, then you'll get directions. (1) Google Assistant offering directions when asked about a restaurant. (2) Asking Google Assistant for directions. #10: Get the Latest News Delivered Daily Google Assistant is good with conversation, but you can still be curt with it. Just say or send words like "News," "Weather," or "Sports," then Assistant will give you a quick rundown of the latest information on that topic. From there, you can take things a step further by subscribing to this topic. After asking for information like "News," simply say "Send me daily," then select a time, and from now on, Google Assistant will give you a briefing on the topic every day. (1) Asking Google Assistant to send the news daily. (2) Google Assistant will now send news reports every night at 6 p.m. Don't Miss: 20 Google Home Easter Eggs & Fun Commands Follow Gadget Hacks on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and YouTube Follow Android Hacks on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest Follow WonderHowTo on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Google+ Cover image via Google/YouTube; screenshots by Dallas Thomas/Gadget Hacks Related How To: Tell Google Assistant 'I'm Feeling Lucky' for a Fun Easter Egg News: Google Assistant Coming to Many More Android Devices How To: Make Google Assistant Control Almost Anything with IFTTT How To: Get the Pixel's Google Assistant Working on Other Android Devices How To: Google Actually Has 4 Different 'Assistants'—Here's the Best One for You How To: 18 Tips & Tricks to Help You Master Your Google Pixel News: Google's New Assistant Lets You Have Conversations with the Internet How To: 20 Google Home Easter Eggs & Fun Commands User Testimonials: Why People Are Switching from iPhone to Pixel How To: Get the Pixel's Navigation Buttons & Google Assistant Animation on Your Nexus How To: Get Rid of Google Assistant on Your Android Device & Switch Back to Google Now How To: Replicate the Moto X's "Active Listening" Hands-Free Assistant on Your Samsung Galaxy S3 News: The Pixel Exemplifies Google's New Hardware Philosophy—To Do It Right, Do It Yourself How To: Turn on Google Pixel's Wi-Fi Assistant to Get Secure Access on Open Networks How To: Use Google's Reverse Image Search on Your Android Device News: It's Official—The Made by Google Pixel Smartphones Are Here How To: Keep Siri Under Control on Your iPhone How To: DIY Tin Can Cookie Cutters from Recycled Tuna Fish Cans News: Pixel vs. iPhone 7 (You Might Just Have Buyer's Remorse) How To: 10 Life Hacks That'll Make Your Life Easier & Stress-Free News: This Guy Tested the Google Pixel XL Against the Nexus 6P (Camera Comparison, Google Assistant, & More) How To: Cortana for Android Has Leaked & Here's How to Install It (Update: It's Now on the Play Store) News: Amazing New Digital Assistant Puts Siri & Google Now to Shame How To: Make Siri More Powerful on Your iPhone by Adding These Extra Voice Commands Rumor Roundup: Andromeda, Pixel & More Coming at Google's Oct. 4 Announcement Circle Sunday: Anti-Theft Lunch Bags, London Riots Cleanup & Eureka Cancelled News: Google Assistant's Fantastic Beasts Voice Commands Turn Your Phone into a Wand News: 10 More Amazing Female Photographers to Follow on Google+ Beyond the Still: Chapter 2 Winner Winspiration: 10 Pieces of Hobo Advice to Inspire Your WTFoto Macro Challenge News: Sneak Nutrition Into Almost Any Food DEBUNKED: 3 Viral Google+ Myths News: FarmVille Orchards and Tree Mastery News: Google's Bradley Horowitz Discusses State of Google+ with Tim O'Reilly How To: The Official Google+ Insider's Guide Index News: Canning Mission Warning!

With that in mind, here we’ve round up the best Google Pixel and Pixel XL cases available. Instead of a Nexus this year Google released two Pixel Phones. One with a 5-inch display and the XL with a big 5.5-inch Quad-HD screen. It’s an all metal phone, but there’s also glass on the back which is one of many reasons a case is recommended. Read: Google Pixel Review: A New Type of Android Below we’ve round up a list of some of the best Pixel cases from brands we know, use and trust. Additionally, these cases come right from Google, are available on Amazon, or are from other trusted outlets. Everything from unique artwork, simple TPU cases, hand-made wood cases, wallets and much more. Google made a few cases of their own at release, which is a growing trend. The company is offering live cases, places cases and other custom options. Alternatively, Google also has some fun colorful choices or polycarbonate hard shell covers. There are plenty of options for owners. As many buyers know, since they’re not made by Samsung or Apple there aren’t as many choices for accessories. That said, Google partnered with big brands to offer good protection. Buyers do have more choices than previous Nexus phones though. More importantly, as more options are released we’ll update with our favorites after they’ve been tested and approved. In closing, your best bet is a case from the Google Store, Amazon, or from trusted brands. We’d recommend Spigen, Speck, Otterbox and others. We offer up great cases from all of those companies and more in our slideshow below. Check out these excellent cases and buy one today. Google Clear Case   1 / 20 First things first, getting a case from the phone maker themselves is typically the best route to take. And if you love the color of that really Blue Pixel or enjoy the two-tone back with the metal and glass design, you'll want a clear case. It doesn't look like much more than a standard TPU case, but it's actually made of a hard and durably polycarbonate plastic. Offering cutouts for all ports, buttons, sensors and more. This is a sleek and minimal way to protect the Pixel or XL. It's available now on the Google Store, but it's expensive.  Buy it from Google for $30   1 / 20 9 Responses 10/09/2016 Stacy Reply Anyone tried the DGtle Anti-Scratches Google Pixel Case?

Last week Google released E2EMail, "a Gmail client that exchanges OpenPGP mail." Google's documentation promises that "Any email sent from the app is also automatically signed and encrypted... The target is a simple user experience -- install app, approve permissions, start reading or send sending messages." Trailrunner7 quotes On The Wire: People have been trying to find a replacement for PGP almost since the day it was released, and with limited success. Encrypted email is still difficult to use and painful to implement in most cases, but Google has just released a Chrome plugin designed to address those problems. The new E2EMail extension doesn't turn a user's Gmail inbox into an encrypted mail client. Rather, it is a replacement that gives users a separate inbox for encrypted messages. The system is built on Google's end-to-end encryption library, and the company has released E2EMail as an open-source project. Wired quotes a web security researcher who calls the open sourcing "a telltale sign the project isn't going anywhere. This is a way for them to get their work out there but to absolve themselves of future obligations." But Google's privacy and security product manager responds that they're tackling some very thorny issues like secure key handling, and "The reason we want to put this into the open source community is precisely because everyone cares about this so much. We don't want everyone waiting for Google to get something done." gmail google internet ← Related Links → Free Software Foundation Challenges Tim Berners-Lee On DRM Google Announces 'End-To-End' Encryption Extension For Chrome What Gmail's New TLS Icon Really Means: Email Encryption Is Still Broken Gmail's Encryption Warning Spurs 25% Increase In Encrypted Inbound Emails Google, Unlike Microsoft, Must Turn Over Foreign Emails, Rules Judge Submission: Google Pushes Encrypted Email System Out Into the World Microsoft Finally Releases A Beta Version of Skype For Linux Google Open Sources Encrypted Email Extension For Chrome More | Reply Login Google Open Sources Encrypted Email Extension For Chrome Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google confirms new Pixel smartphone for 2017 Adam Westlake - Mar 4, 2017 7 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Last year, Google released two of the best premium Android smartphones ever with their own Pixel and Pixel XL. This can be seen in the fact that both models of the device are still hard to find, even months after launch. At this point, however, eager users might just be better off waiting until later this year, as Google has confirmed that the Pixel’s successor will debut in 2017. Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior VP of hardware, revealed this news in an interview with Android Pit this week, noting that “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it.” He continued with: “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” SlashGear’s Pixel XL Review While a follow-up to the Pixel was already a no-brainer, users may not want to hold out for the next version if they’re hoping it will be any more affordable. The cheapest model of the current Pixel starts at $650, with prices of the Pixel XL topping $800. When asked about the possibility of a budget-friendly version of the smartphone, Osterloh responded “the Pixel stays premium.” While Osterloh kept quiet on a release date, Google’s past releases have shown that a “Pixel 2” debut sometime in 2017’s fourth quarter is most likely. The original Pixel was launched in October of last year, and the same time period has been used to unveil older Nexus devices.

A pathologist’s report after reviewing a patient’s biological tissue samples is often the gold standard in the diagnosis of many diseases. For cancer in particular, a pathologist’s diagnosis has a profound impact on a patient’s therapy. The reviewing of pathology slides is a very complex task, requiring years of training to gain the expertise and experience to do well. Even with this extensive training, there can be substantial variability in the diagnoses given by different pathologists for the same patient, which can lead to misdiagnoses. For example, agreement in diagnosis for some forms of breast cancer can be as low as 48 per cent, and similarly low for prostate cancer. The lack of agreement is not surprising given the massive amount of information that must be reviewed in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Pathologists are responsible for reviewing all the biological tissues visible on a slide. However, there can be many slides per patient, each of which is 10+ gigapixels when digitized at 40X magnification. Imagine having to go through a thousand 10 megapixel (MP) photos, and having to be responsible for every pixel. Needless to say, this is a lot of data to cover, and often time is limited. To address these issues of limited time and diagnostic variability, Google is investigating how deep learning can be applied to digital pathology, by creating an automated detection algorithm that can naturally complement pathologists’ workflow. Google used images (graciously provided by the Radboud University Medical Center) which have also been used for the 2016 ISBI Camelyon Challenge1 to train algorithms that were optimized for localization of breast cancer that has spread (metastasized) to lymph nodes adjacent to the breast. The results? Standard “off-the-shelf” deep learning approaches like Inception (aka GoogLeNet) worked reasonably well for both tasks, although the tumour probability prediction heatmaps produced were a bit noisy. After additional customization, including training networks to examine the image at different magnifications (much like what a pathologist does), Google showed that it was possible to train a model that either matched or exceeded the performance of a pathologist who had unlimited time to examine the slides. In fact, the prediction heatmaps produced by the algorithm had improved so much that the localization score (FROC) for the algorithm reached 89 per cent, which significantly exceeded the score of 73 per cent for a pathologist with no time constraint2. Google is not the only ones to see promising results, as other groups were getting scores as high as 81 per cent with the same dataset. Even more exciting for us was that Google’s model generalized very well, even to images that were acquired from a different hospital using different scanners. For full details, see Google’s paper “Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images”. While these results are promising, there are a few important caveats to consider. Like most metrics, the FROC localization score is not perfect. Here, the FROC score is defined as the sensitivity (percentage of tumours detected) at a few pre-defined average false positives per slide. It is pretty rare for a pathologist to make a false positive call (mistaking normal cells as tumour). For example, the score of 73 per cent mentioned above corresponds to 73 per cent sensitivity and zero false positives. By contrast, Google’s algorithm’s sensitivity rises when more false positives are allowed. At 8 false positives per slide, Google’s algorithms had a sensitivity of 92 per cent. These algorithms perform well for the tasks for which they are trained, but lack the breadth of knowledge and experience of human pathologists — for example, being able to detect other abnormalities that the model has not been explicitly trained to classify (e.g. inflammatory process, autoimmune disease, or other types of cancer). To ensure the best clinical outcome for patients, these algorithms need to be incorporated in a way that complements the pathologist’s workflow. Google envisions that algorithm such as Google’s could improve the efficiency and consistency of pathologists. For example, pathologists could reduce their false negative rates (percentage of undetected tumours) by reviewing the top ranked predicted tumour regions including up to 8 false positive regions per slide. As another example, these algorithms could enable pathologists to easily and accurately measure tumour size, a factor that is associated with prognosis. Training models is just the first of many steps in translating interesting research to a real product. From clinical validation to regulatory approval, much of the journey from “bench to bedside” still lies ahead — but Google is off to a very promising start, and Google hopes by sharing their work, they will be able to accelerate progress in this space.

The two Tech giants, who have been accused of a “liberal bias”, will set up the “coalition news verification project” with 37 French and international media outlets including the BBC, AFP (Agence France-Presse), and BuzzFeed News. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER On an official blog post, Google claimed “CrowdTangle” had been set up “with a goal of helping the French electorate make sense of what and who to trust in their social media feeds, web searches and general online news consumption in the coming months…” The first round of the French presidential election is due to be held in April, and polls suggest right wing populist Marine Le Pen could come out on top. The participating media outlets (Credit: Google/News Lab) Following the January election of Donald J. Trump as U.S. president – another right wing populist challenging the establishment – many liberal media outlets claimed voters had been tricked by so-called “fake news” and the result could be discredited. “With combined expertise from across media and technology, CrossCheck aims to ensure hoaxes, rumours and false claims are swiftly debunked, and misleading or confusing stories are accurately reported,” Google said. “With the French presidential election approaching, journalists from across France and beyond will work together to find and verify content circulating publicly online, whether it is photographs, videos, memes, comment threads and news sites.” The public will be encouraged to submit questions and links to news and social media content they wish to see investigated. The questions will then be listed alongside answers on the CrossCheck website, Google explained via its News Lab arm. “Each participating newsroom will contribute their own experience, resources and regional knowledge to speed and strengthen the verification process, and to ensure that accurate reports reach citizens across the country and beyond,” the website adds. In August 2016, Facebook fired its entire Trending News team, formerly responsible for curating the platform’s “Trending News” list, after Breitbart News and others reported accusations of progressive, liberal biases. At the beginning of this year, Facebook launched their own features in Germany to counter fake news after authorities had claimed such stories could help populists in this year’s elections and threatened to sue unless unfavourable content was deleted quickly. The social media site has been working with the European Union (EU) since December 2016 to censor “hate speech”, as well as help authorities “criminalise” “individual perpetrators” and “promot[e] independent counter-narratives” that the EU favours. National governments are also interested in influencing online content. German officials have proposed creating a special government unit to combat fake news and the UK parliament is set to launch an inquiry this year, claiming the phenomenon is undermining democracy. After the U.S. election, the left wing website Buzzfeed claimed that, overall, fake news accounted for 10.6 million of the 21.5 million shares, reactions, and comments on U.S. political stories on Facebook last year. However, President Donald. J. Trump accused Buzzfeed of being “fake news” after the website published lurid and unsubstantiated claims about the then president-elect. Despite publishing allegedly fake news, BuzzFeed is part of the CrossCheck project with Google and Facebook.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Perspective is still in early days of development, but in the future, you may have to adjust your speech in order to satisfy the lofty standards of Google. Otherwise, the company’s faceless AI might just have to “improve” you. Where’s Sarah Connor when you need her? The good news is that, for now at least, Perspective is about as effective as C-3PO with a lisp. Software engineer and columnist David Auerbach has found the program woefully inept at sorting “toxic” comments from ordinary ones. Because the AI currently focuses on words rather than meanings, inoffensive comments like, “Rape is a horrible crime,” or, “few Muslims are a terrorist threat,” were assigned “toxicity” ratings of over 75 percent. Of course, even if Perspective could successfully sort “toxic” comments from innocuous ones, that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to be deleted or buried. According to the project’s homepage, the system performs no function other than detection. But statements from the project’s developers make it clear that censorship is the end goal. Indeed, the system seems to have been developed to augment the left’s ongoing war on comments sections. The software was initially made available just to organizations that are part of Google’s Digital News Initiative, including the BBC, The Financial Times, and The Guardian, which promptly began testing the software to moderate their comments sections. “News organizations want to encourage engagement and discussion around their content, but find that sorting through millions of comments to find those that are trolling or abusive takes a lot of money, labour and time,” says Jared Cohen, president of Jigsaw, the Google social incubator that built the tool. “As a result, many sites have shut down comments altogether. But they tell us that isn’t the solution they want.” Google couldn’t be clearer: it’s a censorship bot. And just because it’s currently limited to news sites and comments sections doesn’t mean it won’t be rolled out to social networks and the rest of the web. Twitter, which just introduced yet another system to punish users who hurt celebrities’ feelings, would probably love to get their hands on a working version of Perspective. Twitter already has a tremendous depth of data on its users, including gender, location, and personal interests. Imagine that data, combined with an AI tool designed to pinpoint inconvenient content, in the hands of a CEO who has done little to conceal his political biases. The idea of an all-powerful Google robot watching over us all, making sure our speech is “improved,” has greatly excited mainstream media. Google, says the BBC, is going to “make talk less toxic.” According to WIRED, Perspective will put a stop to “abusive comments that silence vulnerable voices.” New York magazine portrays Perspsective as a friendly a robot, “a kind of Clippy for the comments section.” Our robot overlords are certainly getting a warm welcome The left are likely to be disappointed though. If Auerbach’s early research on Perspective is any guide, the system is designed to filter out impoliteness, not political disagreement. Google’s censorbot might turn the comments section – and perhaps the web – into a grey, sanitized dystopia scrubbed of strong emotions and trollish humor, but it won’t get rid of facts. In other words, myths about gender wage gaps, police racism, and “moderate” Islam are still going to get debunked. Even Skynet can’t keep some things quiet.

US tech giant Google will release a new Pixel smartphone later this year. The device, with the built-in personal Google Assistant, will directly competes with the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. "The device will remain 'premium' in its next iteration and the company is not interested in offering a low-cost version, preferring instead to let that segment be addressed by its external hardware partners," techcrunch.com quoted Rick Osterloh, Google SVP of Hardware as saying. Launched last year, Pixel is the first smartphone that works as an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator. The 5-inch smartphone is equipped with Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM and runs on Android Nougat 7.0 operating system. The device also has Pixel Imprint -- a fingerprint scanner on the back of the smartphone for quick access to all apps, texts and e-mails.

This mission is the most comprehensive scientific survey of the reef in history.

A small investigation Women in baseball: A league of their own and so much more Riffed from the Headlines 04/03/2017 Full Episode Ninety per cent of the world's coral reefs are expected to be killed off over the next three decades, but as Richard Vevers tells Day 6 host Brent Bambury, communication and underwater photography could help reverse that trend. "We will have a record and we can monitor change over time. Something that was previously very difficult to do at scale," says Vevers, who is the founder and CEO of a non-profit group The Ocean Agency. Richard Vevers says some of their early work near Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef is some of the most viewed underwater imagery of all-time. (Richard Vevers / Catlin Seaview Survey) He and his team have developed what amounts to a version of Google Street View for the ocean. Vevers says their images will provide documentation that can be used for science and to raise awareness for the cause. Vevers spent ten years in advertising but after a bad meeting, he gave it up to become an underwater photographer. The Ocean Agency's photos have generated millions of views online. "That gets me excited in terms of the potential for this kind of imagery, to engage people with issues that very few are aware of," Vevers says.

It provides panoramic views from positions along many streets in the world. Vevers says his project isn't so different, except he uses a camera connected to a military-grade, underwater scooter to capture his environment instead of a camera mounted on the roof of a car. In 2013, The Ocean Agency project went global with stops in the Caribbean Galapagos, Monaco and numerous other locations. (The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers) Vevers says the self-propelled scuba scooter takes some of the burden off the diver in moving along, and they cover two kilometres worth of photography per dive. "The ocean in a very big place, but we are able to get a really good representation of so many different environments in so many different countries using this technology," he says. And just like Google cars follow roads, Ocean Agency photographers follow patterns created by the coral reefs, recording images every three seconds as they go along. "Most people don't dive and never will. What I wanted to do with the camera we invented is to allow people to have the experience of jumping into the water, and be able to explore an environment like a coral reef, which to me is the most magical place on the planet," he says.     One of The Ocean Agency's main goals is to monitor the reefs for scientific purposes, and the images and technology have the power to draw attention to the issues oceans face. That's how they pitched the idea to Google. "We showed them the kind of imagery that we would be able to get," he says. "Instantly, they were big fans of the project and wanted to make it happen." The underwater images are available to view on Google Earth.   Creating awareness Vevers says reefs may be small in size compared to the rest of the ocean, but they're hugely important to the ocean as a whole. "Coral reefs support about 500,000,000 people worldwide as a main source of protein and income. They also support about 25 per cent of all marine species." In late 2016, scientists surveying the Great Barrier Reef said it had suffered the worst coral die-off ever recorded after being bathed in warm waters that bleached and then weakened the coral. That's just one example. Bleaching is happening to reefs across the world. Coral bleaching is a process in which coral colonies lose their colour, which happens when the water is too warm for the microscopic algae living in the organisms. A side-by-side virtual dive of the same coral reef in Hawaii - before and after coral bleaching. After the last two and a half years of documenting what has become the biggest coral die-off ever recorded, Vevers and his partners launched  50 Reefs. The program aims to save what's left of the world's 50 most important coral reefs. "We saw this happening on a massive scale and wanted to do something about it. We realized there wasn't a global plan to address this issue," he says. "I didn't realize how advanced it was until I started working on the project. Now you realize we've only got a very small window of opportunity to save coral reefs." Richard Vevers with the SVII camera. The device attached to the camera pulls him along. (The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey )      Saving the 10% The latest report from the IPCC says that if temperatures increase beyond 1.5 degrees centigrade, approximately 90 per cent of coral will be lost. "We need to find the reefs that we can save," says Vevers, referring to the remaining ten per cent. His photography will help locate the reefs that are least vulnerable to climate change, helping scientists narrow their efforts and resources to the reefs that have the best chance of survival. "We can also work out which part of the reefs are best at re-seeding other parts of the reefs," he says.

(The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers) For survival, location matters. In the 1980s, The Galapagos Islands lost lost 97 percent of its coral in the first of what is now three major bleaching events. The Galapagos is considered extremely vulnerable, whereas reefs near Indonesia remain healthy. "Even at the height of the big, global bleaching event, it was in pristine condition with amazing coral cover and amazing fish life," Vevers says.

(The Ocean Agency) Getting the word out While Vevers left advertising in his wake, he says the skills he gained have been instrumental in pulling 50 Reefs together. "Communication is hugely important. Often, a lot of great science gets hidden in papers read by scientists rather than getting out to the media." he says.   "What we wanted to do, right at the start of this project, is balance communication with the science. And get that balance right to make sure this news is front page news. And we've had a lot of success over the last few years."

Even before his moving van is unpacked, Bobby introduces himself. He’s friendly and good-humored, and he says you should come over for a barbecue sometime. But there’s something “off” about him, so you decide to find out more — his career, his past, anything suspicious. But short of hiring a private investigator, what can you find out? A lot, actually. You’d be amazed how much public information is tangled up in the web. No matter how hard we may try to disguise our past, much of our lives has been digitized and archived, just waiting to be discovered. This is a double-edged sword, of course. If you want to find information on others, that process has never been more streamlined. But it might be just as easy for others to investigate you. It’s a great idea to look yourself up and erase what you don’t want to be readily accessible. Click here to learn how to remove your personal information from the most popular people-search sites. So what can you learn about someone? Here’s how to get the dirt on Bobby, for free. Start with Google Google is the easiest place to begin your search. Just enter the person’s full name in quotations marks, in this case, “Bobby Smith.” There are plenty of Bobby Smiths out there, so you’ll want to narrow your search using other information, such as what city he lives in. If he just moved to your neighborhood from Cincinnati, you’ll want to include that city instead of your own. If Bobby likes to make friends, a bunch of social media sites may pop up: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest and scores of others. Many people make their social media profiles invisible to non-friends. To see Bobby’s details, you may have to send him a connection request. Remember, though, that many people don’t use their real names online. If you find Bobby’s online alias (Smirk Bob, perhaps), you may find that Bobby uses the same screen name for his other social media accounts. Finally, run a Google image search to locate pictures of Bobby. You might find out that he’s a champion swimmer. You might also find out that he was arrested for a DUI. A one-stop shop for information Next, try PeekYou. Instead of locking in on keywords, PeekYou looks for links that are likely associated with the people you’re investigating. When it finds information, PeekYou indexes all the links in one place for easy browsing. You can quickly see an overview of just about anyone. You can also search by categories, such as interests, work, school, city, phone, and email. You’ll be surprised by what you find. Click here to scour more than 60 sites ranging from social media to news outlets. Check out your neighbors So what happens if Bobby doesn’t introduce himself, and you have no idea what his name is? There’s a website where you can enter your address, pull up a map of your block and click on houses to see publicly available information about the people living around you. Instead of rooting through his mailbox, which is illegal, click here for an online phone book that uses modern social-networking technology. Find out where photos were taken If you’ve never heard of The Beat, prepare to be amazed. As you may know, lots of digital photos are embedded with metadata, including where the photo was taken. The Beat combines those “geotags” with Google Street View, so you can see what publicly posted photos were shot in your neighborhood. The internet doesn’t get more vivid than this: an album of images taken on your block by people you may never have met. Adding to the anxiety are the privacy issues that The Beat raises. So be careful about the photos you post, especially if you’ve used geotags to indicate where they were snapped. Click here to see photos taken in your neighborhood. Check the sex offender registry The bottom line is this: You want to make sure Bobby isn’t a threat, and one of the most frightening threats is a convicted sex offender. With the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website, all you have to do is enter a ZIP code and run a search to see a list of convicted offenders in your area. You see pictures of the sex offenders and their home and work addresses. In some cases, you’ll also see a risk level. Click here to check if a sex offender lives in your area. If all goes well, you’ll find that Bobby is an upstanding citizen with a clean record and a lot of worthy friends. But it never hurts to double-check. One word of warning: always take the information with a grain of salt. People search sites can accidentally combine separate people in one profile. If there’s another Bobby Smith from Cincinnati, the system might confuse the two, making you believe your neighbor is actually someone else. Want to hear more about online research techniques?

While this shouldn’t really surprise anyone, the news is reassuring and will allow for some exciting rumors in the coming months. For months on end leaks and rumors have been talking about the Galaxy S8, but that isn’t the only important phone coming in 2017. This will be a big year for Google, and a successor to the Pixel and Pixel XL should have many buyers excited. Read: Google Pixel XL Review In fact, a few loose rumors have been floating around regarding what to expect from the Pixel 2. That’s it though, nothing but rumors. Stating it will have an even better camera, faster processor and even a budget model is in the works. Today though, something different is being said. Last year the first phone “designed by Google, inside and out” was released. Made by HTC but sold exclusively as a Google phone on Verizon and unlocked. It was arguably one of the best smartphones of 2016. This year though, something even better is in the works. According to Google VP of hardware Rick Osterloh, a new Google Pixel 2 is coming in 2017. The lineup of smartphones will remain “premium” meaning users can expect a high-price tag and a top-tier device. This information was shared with AndroidPit. He went on to further by talking about the current generation device, and the lack of availability. For those unaware, the Google Pixel XL is a popular phone but out of stock almost everywhere. Those who want one can’t get it, until more inventory arrives. This has been a problem for Google in the past with Nexus devices, and continued with the Pixel series. It’s worth noting that after multiple questions Google’s VP of hardware made sure to mention that there will not be a cheap Pixel this year. Early rumors suggested another high-end phone, and then a more wallet-friendly $399-$449 device for those in the budget market. Apparently Google has no plans to enter the competitive budget segment being dominated by OnePlus and Huawei. As of right now we have no concrete details regarding what to expect, but one can speculate. Most likely Google’s next phone will be water-resistant, have a bigger screen, and potentially small bezels like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. We can also assume it will have a better camera, faster processor, more RAM, and again come with 128GB of storage with no micro-SD slot. Google Pixel 2 Release Date So when will Google’s new Pixel 2 be released? With a Galaxy S8 and new iPhone’s coming, this will be an important question. However, it’s important to remember that Google almost always releases smartphones around the same time every year. That being near the end. The Pixel was released in October, and before that the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P were announced in October also. When asked about a Google Pixel 2 release date, Rick Osterloh had this to say: “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it.” Meaning we can expect a new phone from Google sometime near the end of the year. Likely in September to compete with Samsung or Apple, or in October like always. There aren’t too many details right now. Just know that another high-end premium phone is coming from Google in 2017.

When the first Google Pixel hit the internet for purchase, many Nexus users had sticker shock and many refused to buy it. The Google Pixel 2 has now been confirmed to be releasing sometime in 2017 with no confirmation if it will be October as the previous device was. Rick Osterloh, SVP of Hardware at Google and thus the big boss for the Pixel project, confirmed with Android Pit that the Google Pixel 2 will indeed surface this year. Osterloh said, “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it.” He then follows up more concretely by saying, “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” This also makes it clear that the Pixel was by no means a one-off experiment, but that it will remain a fixed quantity in the smartphone world. He also confirmed that the Pixel will be at home in the upper price segment. “Pixel stays premium,” explains the hardware boss of Google. Also, he stuck to his answer through repeated questioning by various round table participants: there will be no cheap Pixel. Google will continue to leave lower price segments to other manufacturers. There has been some hope that perhaps Google would introduce a lower-priced Pixel phone more akin to Nexus devices in terms of price. From Osterloh’s comments above, it doesn’t look like Google wants to play any part in the lower-end of the Android device world. For many that will be disappointing news as they have felt that their Nexus devices were solid performers that were already premium. When do you think the new Pixel will be announced? Do you think Google should release a lower-priced Pixel?

Chat app Line is developing an AI assistant and Amazon Echo-style smart speaker Posted Mar 2, 2017 by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story Octane AI boldly bets that Convos are the future of content Messaging app Line is taking a leaf out of the books of Amazon, Google and others after it launched its own artificial intelligence platform. A voice-powered concierge service called Clova — short for “Cloud Virtual Assistant” — is the centerpiece of the service, much like Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google Assistant. Beyond the assistant living inside the main Line chat app, the company said it has plans to release hardware with support for Clova baked-in, as Amazon and Google have done, and work with third parties to integrate the service into additional hardware. Sony and toy maker Tomy are among the early partners it is talking to. Also, interestingly, Line has acquired a majority stake in the Japanese company behind a ‘holographic’ AI service. Vinclu is the startup, and its Gatebox is its ‘virtual robot’ that gives AI a graphical presence in the form of manga cartoon-style female — very Japanese. “Gatebox’s holographic home assistant is voice activated and uses a variety of sensors to interact with the device’s operator in a realistic and natural manner, while also connecting to a range of devices in the home,” Line said. As this promotional video shows, Gatebox is painted more like a virtual companion than a gender-neutral AI assistant. That might require a different approach if the product is to ship outside of Japan, perhaps involving Brown the bear and others who star in Line’s sticker packs. There’s no word on what Line plans to do specifically with Gatebox, but the chat app firm did say that it will introduce Clova to the Line app and begin selling a Clova-powered smart speaker in Japan and Korea in “early summer.” The first iteration of Clova will allow the kind of things other AI apps already do, such as getting news, weather info, playing music, etc. Initially the firm is developing Clova-related services itself — alongside parent firm Naver — but Line said it plans to open the AI platform for both software and hardware up to third parties in the future. That’s where tasks could get more complicated and intricate. “The goal is to create a thriving ecosystem of contents, services and devices with a wide range of partners, allowing the Clova platform to continue to expand and develop over time,” Line said in a statement. The company’s foray into AI seems fairly standard compared to what those leading the space are doing, but Line is the first chat app company to make a sustained push. While an AI might help increase engagement with existing users, it doesn’t seem like a bridge to bring new users into the fold and that is among the key issues Line is currently grappling with. The company, which went public in a dual U.S.-Japan IPO worth $1.1 billion last year, recently posted its largest revenue drop amid slowing user growth, putting it under pressure to generate new revenue streams. In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Takeshi Idezawa admitted that the AI strategy — which will include more M&A deals — would not immediately address those concerns. “It’s one of the longer-term bets. The point is to secure a position early on. People will probably begin to use these services more regularly three to five years from now,” he said. In the nearer term, Line is focusing on adding advertising to its monetization mix, which is primarily composed of in-app purchases for games and sticker pack sales. One of its other bets has been doubling down on different areas of social. The firm recently increased its stake in Snapchat-like service Snow — also owned by Naver — to close to 50 percent, while it has long pledged to be more than just a chat app. Related services it currently offers include mobile payments, music streaming, taxis on-demand and more. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase LINE Corporation Founded 2000 Overview LINE Corporation develops calling and messaging applications for mobile phones in Japan and internationally.

Google announced this week a new live TV service called YouTube TV. Critics are panning YouTube TV as lackluster and overpriced. But I think it's going to change everything. Google says YouTube TV will be rolled out "soon" and gradually, starting in major markets and later expanding to other cities. (Sorry, world. YouTube TV is U.S. only.) [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Google did not specify which cities or when rollouts would occur, but it hardly matters. U.S. residents can sign up immediately even if they live outside one of the designated cities. Simply choose one of the markets where YouTube TV is available. Local programming will be from that market, not yours. A superficial glance at YouTube TV could make you shrug with indifference. It costs $35 per month for a family plan of six accounts and is set to begin broadcasting 40 channels starting in a few months. These channels include ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, the CW, ESPN, USA, Bravo, E, MSNBC, Fox News, Disney Channel, FX and local stations. (Members can also add Showtime or Fox Soccer Plus for an additional, yet-unannounced extra fee.) Conspicuously absent are: CNN, HBO, AMC, MTV, VH1, ET, Comedy Central, Discovery, Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, TNT, PBS, TBS or The Food Network. YouTube TV will play on dedicated iOS and Android smartphone and tablet apps and on the tv.youtube.com web site. It can also be streamed to full-fledged TVs with Google’s $35 Chromecast dongle, or TVs with Chromecast support built-in. Later this year, YouTube TV will be supported by unspecified TVs, "TV-streaming devices" and gaming consoles, according to Google. As a bonus, YouTube TV comes with content from YouTube Red, the ad-free subscription service, and Google Play Music. YouTube TV will not require a contract or commitment and can be canceled without a fee. It can also be paused and will even pause automatically if nobody logs into it for three months from their home zip code. So you're paying $35 per month, but you can pause it for, say, six months and not pay for those months, then resume it later. If you or your family members don't log in from your home zip code for three months, YouTube TV will stop charging your credit card until you re-activate it. Why YouTube TV is better than cable YouTube TV seems like it's half as good as a cable subscription. It's roughly half the cost, and you get roughly half the stations and half the commercials as with the most basic cable subscription. But that comparison obscures cable's flaws and YouTube TV's strengths. In the old days, cord cutting meant giving up on legal, high-quality access to some of your favorite cable TV shows. Lately, however -- thanks to internet-based TV services like DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV and now YouTube TV -- you can get most of the shows online that used to require a cable subscription. Streaming services like Netflix, Roku, Hulu, HBO Go and Amazon Fire TV have become a little cheaper and a lot better. These companies are making improvements the old-fashioned way -- through better technology. One example is Netflix, which announced this week its intention to use artificial intelligence (A.I.) to encode video on a scene-by-scene basis in a way that improves video quality on a smartphone -- or, more to the point, enables Neftlix to selectively reduce video quality (and bandwidth usage) in ways that aren't noticeable to viewers. (The new technology will roll out within five months, according to Netflix.) The bottom line is that cable has lost its monopoly on high-quality TV shows. As a result, the majority of the value of cable is live "event television." For certain major shows, most of the enjoyment is derived from watching the show live. Even now, it's hard or impossible for most cord cutters to watch live, high-quality, user-friendly event TV like the Oscars, TV series or season finales (such as last year's season finale of Game of Thrones), political debates, breaking news and just about any major sports event. Event TV has become a social media phenomenon. It's fun to tweet and post about event TV while it's happening. If you show up for work the next day, everybody's going to be talking about the show you missed; you'll end up with an earful of spoilers and a bad case of feeling left out. Sports are a special problem, because games and matches happen so often. Every game your team plays is "event television" if you're a fan. Depending on the sport, it's possible nowadays for cord cutters to watch some games live. The streaming services offer ESPN and Fox Sports channels, and some offer American football channels. You can also pay to get streaming games for baseball, basketball, hockey and soccer. But the options for cord cutters are often inadequate for sports fans, especially for college sports and less mainstream sports. Sure, you can always buy rabbit ears and connect to terrestrial TV for local channels. Some cord cutters selectively "borrow" broadcast programming from a friend or relative with a cable subscription. But these aren't appealing solutions for most viewers. YouTube TV offers nearly all event television, including sports. The mainstream network stations offered by YouTube will give you the Oscars, major political and breaking news events, the Olympics and others. It also offers generous sports programming, and even good coverage of college sports. YouTube TV includes not only ESPN, but also ESPN2, ESPNU, the Big Ten Network, SEC Network, CBS Sports Network, NBCSN, FS1, Fox Sports Networks and Comcast SportsNet. So while YouTube TV offers only half the "channels" of basic cable, they offer most of the "value" for most of the viewers. YouTube TV has other big advantages over cable, including Google Home support and better recommendations about what to watch, according to the Google announcement. Google is great at algorithmic recommendations and search. Each family membership allows the playing of up to three shows at once on different devices -- and recording to six cloud DVR accounts, each with unlimited capacity (Recordings will be available for nine months). Unlimited storage plays into a strength Google has used to clobber the competition in other spheres, including photo storage on Google Photos. "Cloud DVR" is "transformational for our business," Sling TV CEO Roger Lynch said recently. That company offers cloud DVR, but with a cap of 100 hours of recording, and users cannot record shows from ABC, Disney and ESPN networks. Why YouTube TV means the end of cable Google is in a far better position than any TV or streaming video provider to monetize live TV. Google can command higher ad prices because it has far better data on users than cable TV companies do. Advertising companies have been looking forward to YouTube live TV for years because YouTube is expected to have both the industry's best targeting and measurement for ads, and also the largest market of young viewers. With limited ad budgets and with YouTube demanding premium fees, Google is likely to pull budgets away from other providers, especially cable providers. Trends in TV viewership favor Google. People over the age of 30 think of TV as involving living rooms, giant TVs and cable subscriptions. But younger viewers favor YouTube and smartphones. (A recent Piper Jaffray survey found that 26% of American teenagers watch YouTube every day.) So what happens when young viewers get older? As young people age, they'll gradually prefer more conventional TV programming over the zany, hyperactive antics of YouTube stars. With YouTube TV they'll be able to find that programming on their favorite medium -- YouTube on smartphones. You can imagine a freshman going off to college. YouTube TV would be a slam dunk. A family plan would enable parents to pay for the student's TV content, as well as one account for each parent and each younger sibling, all for the same $35 per month. Even before YouTube TV hits, YouTube itself is by all accounts a runaway success. YouTube said last month that its users watch more than a billion hours of video each day. Viewership is 10 times higher than it was just five years ago. Advertising on YouTube earned Google $3 billion in revenue last year. But YouTube TV should make YouTube even better. YouTube Red Originals are shows developed by YouTube stars and also by more traditional TV content creators. The introduction of YouTube TV and the inclusion of YouTube Red in the package is likely to increase audience and incentive for more and better original exclusive YouTube content. It may be only a matter of time before YouTube introduces runaway hits with the quality and scale of House of Cards or Game of Thrones. YouTube TV is a nightmare for cable TV companies, which are already bleeding customers. Cable providers lost 1.7 million paid U.S. subscribers last year, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett. YouTube TV offers flexible options, event TV, mobility and the familiarity of YouTube. For advertisers, YouTube TV provides a big incentive to move ad spending from cable providers to YouTube. Cable TV is doomed. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The report quoted the head of hardware at Google, Rick Osterloh. This follows earlier reports confirming that a Pixel 2 was in the works, but that no launch date was confirmed. Osterloh said that even though he couldn’t confirm a date, there was an annual rhythm to the industry which you could count on Google to follow. The Pixel will remain in the premium category, and there will not be a “cheap” Pixel.

At the Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona, Google’s Product Management Director Gummi Hafsteinsson hinted that Google Assistant might also be launched across iPhones. Hafsteinsson revealed at MWC that Google Assistant will now be available on Android TV, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Auto. I don’t think we have anything to announce at this point, but I think the general philosophy is that we would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible. While the search engine giant made a prominent move in introducing the Google Assistant to other, earlier unsupported, Android smartphones, the inclusion of iPhone in the list will be welcomed.   Though Siri is the iPhone’s original assistant, the Google Assistant will be available on iPhones through Google’s iOS apps. However, you can still technically get the Google Assistant on iPhones via the Google Allo app. Rumors suggest that Apple may introduce an upgrade for Siri at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, allowing more AI features and capabilities for the already heavily used virtual assistant. With Google Assistant on iPhones, it will be interesting to see who garners more popularity amongst iOS users. likethis What's your reaction?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals General  ⋮  Mobile These Renders Of Google’s Mountain View Campus Are Breathtaking By Zara Ali Feb 28, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Mountain View campus Two years ago, Google publicly shared its vision for a revolutionary Mountain View campus. Over time, the tech giant overhauled its plans and changed the architectural language for the campus. Google recently shared renders for the upcoming campus. The renders look amazing, and if that’s what Google has in mind for the future campus, then we can’t wait to see it turning into reality soon. In the renders, Google states that there will be a massive canopy inside the campus, which will take control of the indoor climate, quality of air, and sound. This new square structure is being built outside the Googleplex. The tech giant wants the canopy to complement the existing design language that the company follows for other buildings. Google’s Mountain View campus will be open for general public as well. Google calls it a “destination for the local community.” The ground floor of the campus will be open every day from morning till evening. It will also house a pedestrian pathway that will lead visitors inside the main building. The ground floor of the building will also be a destination for restaurants and shops that will be open for residents, visitors, employees, and others. Google also says that the campus will have some open spaces, right from a public plaza to “quieter and more intimate spaces for collaboration and private conversation.” The building will be environmental friendly with parks and other green spaces, which Google calls “Green Loop.” Pathways will surround the entire green area for walking and cycling. Advertisement The second floor will be dedicated to employees, and it will feature “highly flexible and reconfigurable” spaces. Google’s dream campus is turning into a reality after Google and LinkedIn agreed to exchange their lands. The construction of the new campus might take more than 30 months after getting approval from Mountain View City Council. The project has already been reviewed and discussed by City Council Study Session and Development Review Committee in July 2016. The renders of the Mountain View campus are breathtaking, and the best part is that Google will be making it accessible to the general public as well. What’s your thought on the Mountain View campus?

Live Watch Google's Top 17 Easter Eggs, Gags, and Hoaxes By ABC News March 20, 2008 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email Buried Deep in Google Google Web site--and many of the company's software programs--are loaded with gags, goofs, and Easter eggs that have helped Google maintain a fun-loving spirit in the cutthroat world of Web competition. Of course, Google always has a good idea. Thousands of our readers have enjoyed past explorations of wonders like "The Strangest Sites in Google Earth" and "The Most Spectacular Sights in Google Sky." So when we heard stories of hidden teddy bears, a Google Romance beta service, and early morning appearances of the Loch Ness monster on Google home pages, we had to check them out. And most of them turned out to be true. Take a look. --Tom Spring, PC WorldGoogle's Official Easter Egg Game It's one thing to find Easter eggs, and it's another thing to catch them. In the spirit of Easter, Google has posted its Google egg drop game--where you, acting as a rabbit, hop up and down and to and fro, trying to put all of your eggs in one basket. The only real point of this game other than to catch eggs that spell out G-O-O-G-L-E. Sorry: No chocolate eggs for those who win. Something Spooky Just After 3 A.M. You could take the high road (or the low road) to Scotland's Loch Ness in hopes of spotting the elusive Nessie, the legendary monster said to reside there. But if you'd rather do your mythic beastie viewing at home in the wee hours of the morning, set your alarm to 3:14 a.m. and your browser to the Beach themed iGoogle page. At precisely that o'clock each day, Nessie surfaces for 60 seconds, then takes a deep breath and dives back under the dark loch's surface. Why that time of the morning? Well, according to programmer's lore, Google developers did it to pay homage to the mathematical quantity pi. Other iGoogle pages using themes have spooky Easter eggs of their own. In the Seasonal Scape, the Northern Lights also appear at 3:14 a.m. Look for UFOs to descend on the City Scape. A monster appears in Spring Scape; and in the Tea House theme, ghostlike fox spirits (well known in Japanese folklore) appear and disappear in the mist of the lake as the fox sleeps.Measuring Spam by the Pound Ever wish you could simply press a button and have all of your Gmail messages printed, sorted, boxed, and shipped to your front door? If you care about keeping your carbon footprint at something smaller than Paul Bunyan dimensions, you'll be glad to know that no such service exists--despite an elaborate hoax Google perpetrated to make Gmail users believe otherwise. As part of a 2007 April Fool's Day joke, Google announced the debut of Gmail Paper, which would allow users to create a hard copy of their entire Gmail account. In a nod toward environmental consciousness, Google said that it would avoid cutting trees down to print people's Gmail archives, instead using paper composed of "96 percent post-consumer organic soybean sputum. Oh well.Google Searches in Klingon or Fudd The United Nations may not recognize Klingon as a language, but that hasn't stopped Google from catering to the fictitious species of extraterrestrial anthropomorphs from the Star Trek series with a specialized Klingon search engine. Nor has it prevented Google from developing a number of other specialty search engine interfaces, including Elmer Fudd and Pig Latin. Google also serves up specialty searches that cater to humans and others who seek information regarding Microsoft, Linux, and BSD Unix.Google Gulp for Smarter Searching In 2005, Google decided that--instead of just making Google searches smarter--it would try to make the people conducting Google searches smarter as well. The solution--literally--was Google Gulp Beta, a drink formulated in four yummy flavors (Glutamate Grape, Sugar-Free Radical, Beta Carroty, and Sero-Tonic Water). The secret ingredient: a chemical compound designed to optimize the drinker's use of the Google search engine by rendering the individual more intelligent. For all you non-MENSA members, here's the bad news: It was another Google hoax. Oh, well--back to MSG and syrupy radicals...Soaring Across Google Earth Buried in the free mapping program Google Earth is a nifty flight simulator that lets you either hop into the cockpit of an F16 fighter jet or a lightweight SR22 propeller-powered airplane. To access the flight simulator in Google Earth, open the program and press Ctrl-Alt-A on your keyboard (Command-Option-A on a Mac). In addition, Google provides keyboard shortcuts for desktop pilots.Adding It Up With Google Calculator Thanks to Google Calculator, you can use the Google search box for serious number crunching--anything from converting currency to solving advanced math equations. But things don't always add up the way you think they will with Google Calculator. Try searching for "answer to life the universe and everything," "number of horns on a unicorn," or "once in a blue moon" for unexpected computations.Google Gets Romantic--Sort Of Since 2000, Google has honored Every April Fool's Day by preying on the gullible. In 2006, it went after lonely hearts with a Google Romance beta program, which purported to offer "users both a psychographic matchmaking service and all-expenses-paid dates for couples who agree to experience contextually relevant advertising throughout the course of their evening." Did you fall for it?Unsanctioned Googles: Goth y Loco To find this hidden Google treasure, type 'Google Gothic' into the Google search field and--instead of hitting the Search button--select 'I'm feeling lucky.' You'll see Googoth, a specialized search engine that caters to "dark, gothic, industrial, and alternative topics." This search site is not related to Google. Another specialized site unrelated to Google is Google Loco, a parody of Google that's rife with bouncy characters and flashing colors. Tip: Try Google Loco in Internet Explorer for an even better, muy loco experience. Google Street Views Credits The Google employees that make our favorite cool Google services often go unrecognized. But that's not the case with Google Street Views. In a rare Google display of self-acclaim. the Google Street View team posed in the back of the company's Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, California in--you guessed it--a Google Street View. Picasa's Mysterious Bear(s) Google's free image editing and management software Picasa has a wild side that few people know about. Open Picasa and press Ctrl-Shift-Y, and a teddy bear will pop up. Keep pressing those keys and watch out for the sloth (or sleuth) of red-bowtied bears that take over the program. Psychic Google Have you ever been too lazy to type in your Google search query? If so, consider Google MentalPlex search. This Google service figures out what you're looking for before you touch the keyboard, by analyzing the previous five sites you visited and factoring in your local air pressure, your astrological sign, and the "speed and vector of your mouse movements." Okay, you didn't have to conduct an imaginary search to figure this one out: Google MentalPlex was the April Fool's Day hoax for 2000.The Many Faces of Pegman To use the Google Street Views feature in Google Maps, you move what Google calls the Pegman (he's visible in this video) to a specific spot. When you do, up pops the Street View window. To keep things interesting, Google dresses up Pegman on special occasions. For instance, during the week of Christmas, Pegman becomes a snowman; at Halloween, Pegman dons a witch costume; on Valentine's Day, Pegman stands on a heart instead of his usual green circle; and whenever Pegman sets foot on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California, he becomes a tie-dye-shirted hippie. Classic Google Maps Easter Egg A while back, if you asked for directions from, say, New York City to Paris on Google Maps, you would be informed that what objectively appears to be a swim of some 3462 miles across the Atlantic Ocean was in fact merely a stroll of two dozen steps. Last year Google removed this Easter Egg from Google Maps, saying figuratively: "You can't get there from here." Free Broadband Wi-Fi Goes to Pot Cheapskates rejoice. If you ever wished for no-cost broadband Internet access without having to steal it from your neighbor or discommode yourself in any way, Google's free (but advertising-supported) TiSP service is a dream come true. To get TiSP (short for Toilet Internet Service Provider), you first obtain a free self-install kit from Google. Next, you flush one end of the fiber-optic cable (included in kit) down the toilet and then wait for about an hour while the line is connected to the Internet via a "Plumbing Hardware Dispatcher (PHD)." Now hook up your Google wireless router and you're done. Yeah, it was a Google hoax. Fine Dining With Spam If you go to your Spam Folder in Gmail, you'll notice that where you might expect to see an ad of some type, you instead see a recipe that features Spam as the main ingredient. Spam Imperial Tortilla Sandwiches, anyone? Or how about Spam Quiche? For other gastronomical options that feature the pink slab, keep checking your Gmail Spam box. The GoogleTV Beta That Never Was The best Google Easter Egg may be GoogleTV. Simply follow the steps outlined by Infinite Solutions host Mark Erickson in this instructional video. The bad news: If you hope to gain on-demand streaming access to ABC, CBC, NBC, and Fox's primetime line-ups, you'll be sorely disappointed. Infinite Solutions is a parody of a tech show, and none of its mirthful tech "tutorials" really work. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Google's Top 17 Easter Eggs, Gags, and Hoaxes " New satellite imaging allows unprecedented tracking of lightning strikes Europe launches latest earth observation satellite German court to rule in refugee's Facebook lawsuit Business group: China tech plan threat to foreign firms Pennsylvania Senate Democrats resist ransom in cyberattack Scientists tweak seat cushion material to clean oil spills Zap Map: Satellite tracks lightning for better heads up " World's 1st woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, turns 80 Fitbit tracks your steps; now it wants to chart your Zs, too " House Republicans unveil Obamacare replacement plan " Exxon announces expansion program, Trump takes credit US setting up missile defense system in South Korea " North Korea, Malaysia step up dispute over Kim's death " Wedding ring attached to beads thrown in Fat Tuesday parade " Texas grandpa builds amusement park in backyard " Pregnant woman re-enacts giraffe livestream wearing mask " These mushers brave ice, snow and freezing temps to compete in Alaska’s Iditarod dogsled race " Journalist throws up during plane proposal to girlfriend " Young couple finds it 'freeing' to travel the country in a converted van " Dobby the newborn giraffe gets plasma treatment to bolster immune system

It began with an inquisitive mind, a desire to locate the figure portrayed so affectionately within Christian circles. Linvoy Primus An internet search paid dividends, with Google obligingly tracking down the man who spent eight-and-a-half years at Fratton Park. And how Pompey’s rangy midfielder is basking in life on the south coast having at last made Primus’ acquaintance. ‘It’s a funny story,’ said Linganzi. ‘I spent five years in England before going back to France and last summer was with a friend who is a Christian. ‘He asked whether I had heard of Linvoy Primus? I hadn’t. ‘Not long after, I called Leam (Richardson), who I was keeping in contact with, and he asked me to come to Portsmouth on trial. ‘While over here, I was looking for a Christian church to attend and went to two or three. Again, people were asking “Have you heard of Linvoy Primus?” ‘So I went on to Google, checked the Faith and Football website and sent an email. An hour later someone answered. ‘Within two days I met Mick Mellows and then step-by-step we all became friends. ‘I didn’t know Linvoy, all the players I was aware of were more in France, not in England, this is why I hadn’t heard of him. ‘Having met him, I have discovered he has been player of the year at Portsmouth and I am not surprised. ‘God is good and does good things. ‘Together with Mick Mellows, they have helped me a lot at a time when it wasn’t easy. ‘When I arrived here I had no car and lived in a hotel for a few months, then stayed in a club house for a few months, yet it was difficult. ‘I am married, I am a husband, I am a father, and couldn’t spend time with my wife and son, who were back in France. ‘Then you learn to be patient – and that is my strength now.’ Now reunited with his family and living in Waterlooville, Linganzi has fully adjusted to life on the south coast. It began with a trial, followed by a spot as an unused substitute in the pre-season fixture at Steve Claridge’s Salisbury in July. He remained in the Blues’ squad for the final three summer friendlies, before earning a month-by-month deal on the eve of the campaign. These days, Linganzi is established as a regular during Pompey’s encouraging current momentum towards the automatic promotion spots. The 27-year-old is enjoying his longest period yet in the Blues’ first-team in League Two, lining up in the past six matches. A groin injury collected in the midweek draw with Morecambe threatens to bundle him out of Paul Cook’s side for today’s visit of Crewe. Nonetheless, Linganzi’s powerful midfield presence has impressed the Fratton faithful and seen him taken into their hearts. The acceptance is reciprocated during a period in which the product of Saint-Etienne’s youth system believes he has finally discovered peace. Signed by Sam Allardyce in January 2010 for then Premier League side Blackburn, there were high hopes for Linganzi. A debut at Aston Villa in front of 41,799 supporters, only to be substituted at half-time, represented one of three top-flight appearances. Spells at Preston, Accrington and Gillingham then followed, before leaving the English game in March 2015 when his Gills contract was cancelled by mutual consent. Then arrived the moment which Linganzi credits with changing his life. He added: ‘I left Gillingham, went to France and my faith was born again. ‘When you are born again you get a test and I did my test in France. I had my big car and was in the third division with Frejus Saint-Raphael. ‘Everybody knew I had played in England, played a few games in the Premier League, and became a bit jealous. ‘So it was tough, but I stayed strong. I am walking with Jesus, I have no fear. ‘I had been struggling for about a good seven or eight years in football, since the beginning of my career. I was struggling with everything. ‘Now I’m here and that is my past – I am looking to my future.’ Signed up to Fratton Park until the season’s end, he is among many whose presence remains uncertain beyond this summer. Pompey’s continued involvement in the promotion push ensures all contract discussions are currently on hold. In the meantime, Linganzi’s reputation continues to be enhanced, serving alongside Michael Doyle as the team’s holding midfielders. Softly-spoken and cutting a relaxed figure, he is comfortable speaking English, irrespective of a background which saw him born in Algeria, raised in France and represent DR Congo internationally. Linganzi’s faith has been the crucial driving force behind his re-emergence in the English game. And he is keen to use his life experiences to benefit others. He added: ‘Most footballers have many issues, especially those earning lots of money. They have issues with gambling, drugs and alcohol. ‘I know this football world and I am a Christian. ‘If younger players like Conor Chaplin or Nicke Kabamba, for example, wanted to talk then I will do everything for them. ‘When you are shining it’s good, when you come down then no-one is here for you and you can become weak mentally. ‘But you must walk with humility, accept there is something bigger than you, accept there is a creator. Then you just relax yourself and things will come to you.’ Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

Amit Singhal had joined Uber in January as senior vice president of engineering after working for 15 years at Google, where he oversaw the internet giant’s search efforts. A report in Recode said Uber CEO Travis Kalanick asked Singhal to resign on Monday after it was found that Singhal did not disclose to the car-hailing firm he had left Google a year earlier after an allegation against him of sexual harassment. Google had deemed the employee’s claim of sexual harassment against Singhal “credible” in an investigation. The report said Singhal, “a highly regarded engineer in Silicon Valley”, had disputed the allegation to Google executives at the time and denied the allegations again. The report claimed that Google was prepared to fire Singhal over the allegations after probe but did not have to do so after he resigned. The employee who filed the complaint against Singhal did not work for him directly, but worked closely with the search team, the report said, adding that she also did not want to go public with the charges. “Harassment is unacceptable in any setting. I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behaviour,” Singhal said. “In my 20-year career, I have never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own,” he said. Singhal’s departure comes at a time when Uber is facing scrutiny following allegations of sexual harassment by a former female employee against her manager. She said in a blog post last week that her manager had sent inappropriate messages to her and the company’s human resource department were not supportive.

Airtel: Airtel noticed “some immediate impact in the few days post demonetization”, which “was there for a few weeks, but like we saw in some of our other businesses, like DTH, that recovery was reasonably quick. There were some postponement of purchases, but it was quite quick.” Airtel was hurt largely by Reliance Jio’s “Welcome Offer” of giving data free. More details here.

The Internet is both communication and publishing, and regulating content creators is tricky without curbing free speech. How do you treat people who share fake news differently from those who create it? Should there be regulation? How do you ensure that the safe harbour, which provides amnesty for intermediaries and platforms, and has led to the growth of the Internet, is retained? During the #NAMApolicy discussion on Fake News, Rumours and Online content regulation, we looked into both technology and legal means of addressing Fake News.

Read it here The Anatomy of Fake News Following a passionate (heated?) discussion at MediaNama’s event on Fake News last week, many people asked me to publish my views on the subject. In this post, I would like to address a few aspects of this issue, on which everyone from Twitter pundits to Donald Trump has a point of view: Is Fake News a new/Recent /Nascent phenomenon? I don’t think so. The idea of Fake news is probably as old as the idea of news itself, and the same applies to the idea of using Fake News for electoral benefits. The first recorded incident of using fake news goes back to Rome in 1522, where Pietro Aretino tried to manipulate the pontifical election by writing wicked sonnets about all the candidates except his favorite one. The NewYork Review of Books recently published a fascinating post on history of Fake News( link). Read it here “Idea will embark on a massive cost saving initiative in 2017”: Idea MD Himanshu Kapania Idea Cellular will “embark on a massive cost saving initiative in calendar year 2017” across its operation in order to “optimize costs, eliminate wastage and duplication, digitize processes, and simplify (operations),” the company’s Managing Director Himanshu Kapania mentioned in a recent analyst call. Kapania did not mention when the cost cuts would be carried out but added the “the impact of some of these cost reduction initiatives should reflect in the financial year 2017-2018 results.” Read it here J.S Deepak removed as telecom secretary J.S Deepak, the telecom secretary for Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has been effectively removed from his post and moved temporarily to the Department of Commerce as Officer on Special Duty (OSD), reports PTI.

Admitting to the significant under performance of Ditto TV in comparison with STAR TV’s Hotstar, during the earning call in Q3 FY17, Punit Goenka, MD & CEO of ZEEL noted that the company plans to roll out the new strategy during the second half of the current calendar year. When asked about the Ditto TV’s numbers, Goenka declined to comment on it stating that it would be irrelevant to disclose numbers, with the changing strategy. Note that Ditto TV had clocked close to 200 million video views for quarter ending Q2 FY17. Further, Goenka added that DittoTV went live on major telecom operators’ platforms, which he thinks should drive subscriber growth.

Daniel Cooper, @danielwcooper 02.28.17 in Internet Comments 676 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Getty Images/Flickr RF If you didn't think that Google was into everything before, wait until it's providing the infrastructure for your mobile network. The company has announced that it's building tools for cellular carriers to use to run their businesses. Businesses such as India's Bharti Airtel and South Korea's SK Telecom have both signed up to use Google's new platform for network services. Long story short, Google knows how to run a pretty big network, given that it's running both its own branded services, Android and YouTube. By sharing its know-how, it's expected that the networks can cut costs on hardware and be faster to implement new features. Google uses innovations like YouTube's Smart Offline, that trickle-downloads clips overnight when data costs drop, as one such example. It's also another step towards becoming an infrastructure provider for a much bigger chunk of the world's services. After all, Google already runs its own fiber business, as well as a burgeoning mobile network in the form of Project Fi. The search engine is also contributing to an open-source project to improve cloud computing, CORD. That puts it alongside other heavy-hitters like AT&T, China Unicom, NTT and Verizon.

(BigStock Image) More schools are using tablets and laptops in classrooms than ever before, and, in the U.S., Google is leading the charge. Last year, more 12.6 million mobile devices were shipped to schools around the United States. Google Chromebooks accounted for more than half of those, while Microsoft and Apple fell behind, according to a new report by Futuresource Consulting. Google’s growth in the U.S. education technology sector has been quick as well – in 2013, Chromebooks only made up 38 percent of the market. (Futuresource Image) Google’s grip on the education market can be largely attributed to price. Chromebooks remain the most affordable option for schools, with devices costing as low as $120 in some cases. This price point makes them more appealing for schools that have to worry about devices getting lost or broken. Other technology companies now have to lower their price to remain competitive. In January, Microsoft announced Windows 10-powered partner devices that will cost as little as $189. These devices will include the recently launched Microsoft Classroom and the central Microsoft management platform Intune for Education. A cloud-based device management system has been Google’s edge in the sector. It allows schools to easily set up students’ devices remotely and means students can store documents in the cloud and access them from whichever device is nearby. Chromebooks also feature the G Suite productivity tools and Google Classroom.  Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side. Mike Fisher, Futuresource’s associate director of education, said that, while Microsoft is improving its education tools, schools continue to prefer Google’s platform because of its simplicity. “Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side,” Fisher said in a news release. “To date however, these developments have not stopped Google’s momentum within the US K-12 market. Microsoft continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare.” In classrooms abroad, however, it’s a different story. Microsoft dominates the international education sector, accounting for 65 percent of all mobile device sales abroad last year. Overall device sales to schools outside of the U.S. fell 26 percent last year, with only 13.6 million units sold. This likely is due to a variety of factors, Futuresource said, including fewer national projects focused on deploying mobile devices. Microsoft led the market in international mobile device sales to schools, with Google coming in at less than 30 percent. Much of Google’s and Microsoft’s growth has come at the expense of Apple, which has seen a significant decrease in its grip on the education market. In the last three years, sales of iPads to classrooms have steadily fallen. Apple devices accounted for only 14 percent sales in the U.S. in 2016. While iPads have long appealed to classrooms with younger children, older students need keyboards to do work. Apple doesn’t offer an affordable option in that area. Microsoft and Google, however, are creating 2-in-1 products that feature a keyboard and stylus for under $300. Overall, Futuresource notes in the report, this competition between companies has made mobile devices more accessible to schools. “PC provider’s laser focus on the education sector is good news for schools and students,” Fisher said. “2017 will see wide ranges of computing devices, designed specifically for education and at competitive price points, entering the market and vying to be the device of choice for learning.” Jillian Stampher is a journalist based out of Seattle with a focus on breaking news reporting and digital media.

Samsung revealed the new kit at this weekend’s World Mobile Congress in Barcelona. The new system now includes a dedicated controller, not entirely dissimilar to that included with rival Google Daydream. It’s designed to be held like a remote control, includes a touchpad and is motion sensitive. Like Daydream, it can also serve as a point and click device, although it advances on Google’s design a little by incorporating a trigger, making it ideally suited to VR shooter titles. It will be compatible with all existing titles, although 70+ apps that are designed to take advantage of it are apparently in development. Certainly, the move will help devs create titles designed to run across both smartphone VR standards. The Gear VR headset itself includes a strap for holding the controller when not in use – again, like Daydream. The headset’s specs remain the same, boasting 42mm lenses and a 101 degree field of view. It is compatible with the S7, S7 edge, Note5, S6 edge+, S6 and S6 edge. The original Gear VR has sold over 5m units worldwide, making it the world’s most successful VR headset. By comparison, PSVR has sold 910k units since October, and as of December 31st 2016 estimates for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift stood at 420k and 243k respectively. Mobile-based VR offers very few bells and whistles compared to PC and console VR, but is significantly cheaper and far more accessible, requiring only the phone in your pocket. Google Daydream is the most recent competitor to enter the smartphone VR sector. Initially it was only compatible with Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL handsets, although other manufacturers are now adding compatibility to their latest models. Daydream does well for the price, but is still a very limited experience in comparison to the likes of Vive and Rift. The controller, for one, lacks the precision required to play high-end games. Titles tend to run at a slower framerate too, which added to the lack of precise tracking can make the experience a bit vomit-inducing for some. More worryingly for Google, the Daydream experience has led to some overheating problems for some Pixel owners.

But at this year’s proceedings, the artificially intelligent voice-based service struggled to be heard above the din of an army of rival assistants that will soon jostle for attention on smartphones. As the event kicked off Sunday, the search giant announced the Google Assistant would ship on all new phones running its popular Android operating system. The same day, Motorola said its latest Android phones would come with Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa voice-based helper, Google’s nemesis. Executives at Motorola parent Lenovo Group Ltd. explained later that consumers who buy the latest Motorola phones can use both Alexa and Google’s assistant. Soon, they’ll even have a third option: the Chinese manufacturer plans to roll out its own AI-powered service on its devices this year. “I don’t really believe in the supremacy of one assistant,” Lenovo Vice President of Product Dan Dery said in an interview, describing the plan as “bringing AI to hardware.” Google’s version represents one of the company’s biggest bets since it began building a novel web search engine in 1998. It wants to remain the main source of digital information as people talk to their computers more, rather than type. That will require its assistant to be on as many gadgets as possible. But Google’s hardware partners are also betting voice-based computing could be the next big thing, rivalling the mobile boom. VoiceLabs estimates 24.5 million voice-based devices will ship this year in the US, up from 6.5 million in 2016. Amazon leads, while Google is trying to catch up quickly. There’s also a rush to deploy AI techniques, resulting in a Mobile World Congress awash in digital helpers. South Korea’s SK Telecom Co. displayed “Nugu,” an internet-connected speaker akin to Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo. Line Corp. introduced “Clova.” Deutsche Telekom AG had “Tinka,” a customer service chat bot.  Last month, HTC Corp. introduced Sense Companion, a personal companion service with voice-recognition, on its newest Android phone. Even Will.i.am, a hip hop star-turned-tech-entrepreneur, is working on an assistant. When a reporter asked for a demonstration at the conference, the service struggled to follow commands.  Aside from Apple Inc., smartphone makers have largely failed to wring profit from software-based services and lessen their dependence on hardware businesses beset by shrinking margins. Samsung Electronics Co. built its own mobile operating system, with little success, and Samsung Pay vies for mobile purchases with Google’s Android Pay on many smartphones. Samsung is trying again with assistants. In the fall, it acquired Viv Labs, a startup formed by the creators of Apple’s Siri assistant, and is expected to release a digital helper with its newest phone in March. Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer denied these efforts undercut Google’s assistant. ”A lot of [original equipment manufacturers] will choose to do that because they see value in assistants,” he said in Barcelona. “Competition is good.”  Privately, other Google employees said they are less concerned that hardware or telecom companies will build a better digital assistant. Google’s search engine provides ready answers to millions of questions for its voice-based service, and the company has thousands of skilled engineers working on the project — resources that these other firms may struggle to match. A larger concern is Amazon. The e-commerce giant has built a network of software development partners for Alexa, a service that, like Amazon’s flagship online shopping service, could dent Google’s core business of finding and delivering information. If Alexa is on a lot of Android phones, alongside the Google Assistant, which service will answer when people ask their devices valuable questions like which nearby restaurant to book or what holiday gifts to buy? In January, Amazon announced it was bringing the service to Huawei Technologies Inc. phones sold outside of China. Then came Lenovo at MWC. The story of the Chinese company’s Motorola division is a painfully familiar tale for anyone involved in Android. While it’s the most popular software for running phones, Android manufacturers have struggled to make money on hardware, while Google scoops up billions of dollars from mobile services and related ads flowing through the devices.  Lenovo bought the Motorola hardware business from Google in 2014 and the integration has been tough: in the third quarter, Lenovo reported a US$112 million (RM499 million) loss from its mobile division, compared with US$30 million a year earlier. Dery, a former Motorola Vice President who returned to the brand in July, is tasked with breathing new life into the business.  Digital assistants are key to his plan. Lenovo’s coming voice-based service will rely on a personal identifier attached to all users of its hardware, allowing it to work consistently across Lenovo phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers, said Dery. Dery described this as a supplement to the assistants from Amazon and Google. While those two services mostly respond to queries and commands, Lenovo’s will send notifications and alerts based on predictions about users’ behaviour and needs, according to the executive. “We don’t like to call it an assistant because it’s misleading in a way,” he said. “This is something which is always aware, in the background, syncing for you.”  By Dery’s telling, Amazon was quite pleased to hear about his broader AI strategy. “We shared that whole plan with Amazon and they realised, ‘Wow, this is exactly the missing piece for putting Alexa in everyone’s pocket,’” he said. Google wasn’t upset by the move either, he insisted. “They know our plan as well,” Dery said.Still, the more digital assistants get crammed into devices, the more crowding for Google. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week From voice to written notes via Ukrainian Senstone device (VIDEO) Google vows fix for ‘inappropriate’ search results Consumer Reports to consider cyber security in product reviews ‘Pokemon Go’ player dies from heart attack after catching rare Lapras in Singapore China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard ‘Pokemon Go’ player dies from heart attack after catching rare Lapras in Singapore Axiata Digital, Huawei sign MoU to bring Internet of Things capabilities across Asia Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles Google vows fix for ‘inappropriate’ search results Five trends at Mobile World Congress Spotify hits 50 million paid subscribers, lifting music industry Amazon reveals 2017 pilot season lineup Ancient human tree cultivation shaped Amazon landscape Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

With nine updates over the course of twelve months, the push to deliver better search results based on user intent was at the forefront of Google’s efforts. Prioritizing the user and customizing content - from search results to personalized recommendations - goes hand-in-hand with the 2016 push for putting the customer first. Making sense of what the updates mean for your small business website can be tricky. However, E2M Solutions have pulled together the below infographic which encapsulates each update in layman’s terms. The fully animated infographic is viewable at the bottom of the page, but for those curious to know more about each update, here's a summary of each key element. Core Algorithm Update The year’s first algorithm update, appropriately termed “core update” by Google, significantly impacted rankings for a great number of websites. Google was reticent to call it anything more than a quality update, and said it was not linked to either Panda nor Penguin updates. Essentially, spam websites were moved down in search rankings to make room for real business sites. AdWords Placement At the end of February, Google adjusted its AdWords settings, and the pesky right-hand ad bar disappeared from Google searches. Instead, the top four ads - which was a sizable increase given that only one to three ads were previously displayed - were now listed first after the search results. While this was great for advertisers, this change has taken a toll on organic search results and their click through rates. AMP Listings The day after the AdWords update, Google launched its AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) listings in mobile search results. This translated to another change in the layout of search results - now, the AMP listings appeared above the top results or in a carousel format. This was a big step for publishers and advertisers as it gave them increased visibility and faster load times, which improved click through rates. Unconfirmed Update Google never made an official statement about this May update, but those closely monitoring search rankings and SERPs noticed an uptick in activity. Again, think of this as quality control of illegitimate websites. Mobile-Friendly 2 Google admitted to this update, which supported ranking boosts to mobile-friendly websites on mobile search. This was good news if you had recently optimized your website, as it helped your website rank higher on mobile, where so many searches are being conducted. If you haven’t optimized your website yet, now is the time. Possum In September, the Possum update went live, targeting the 3-pack and local, or more commonly known Google Maps results. While, again, this was unconfirmed by Google, it noticeably impacted website rankings based on local parameters and helped hide spam sites. Universal Results Shakeup Later in September, Google cleaned house and remove almost 50% of image results connected to SERPs. As you can imagine, this caused a major ranking upheaval and people took notice. This change made room for more organic Page One search results, which was amazing for businesses. Many images previously found on Page One results were moved to Page Two and beyond in order to bring more relevant SERP content to Page One content. Penguin 4 After a two-year break, Penguin 4 was launched and served to halt a significant amount of spam on a page-by-page basis. The biggest note about this update is that it’s ongoing, so for businesses with penalized web pages, they can quickly adjust the page, and Google will review in real-time. No longer will businesses be banned or put on hold because of a systematic algorithm update. Unconfirmed Update Last but not least, Google ended the year with a third unconfirmed update. Speculation suggests that this update was tied to mobile-first index testing, which would be rolled out at a later date. Only those with their finger on the pulse of SERPs noticed the change, and there were mixed reviews about its strength and total impact. It’s safe to assume that this was a minor update that will be tied to future algorithm updates and the state of website rankings in general.

By: IANS | New York | Published: March 4, 2017 12:11 PM Google pixel phone (Image representation by Reuters) US tech giant Google will release a new Pixel smartphone later this year. The device, with the built-in personal Google Assistant, will directly competes with the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. “The device will remain ‘premium’ in its next iteration and the company is not interested in offering a low-cost version, preferring instead to let that segment be addressed by its external hardware partners,” techcrunch.com quoted Rick Osterloh, Google SVP of Hardware as saying. Launched last year, Pixel is the first smartphone that works as an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator. The 5-inch smartphone is equipped with Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM and runs on Android Nougat 7.0 operating system. The device also has Pixel Imprint — a fingerprint scanner on the back of the smartphone for quick access to all apps, texts and e-mails. Please Wait while comments are loading...

YouTube is awesome. But it can be even more awesome, if you know the right sites and apps to make it better. The developers at YouTube work hard to make apps that improve your experience. But there’s only so much they can do. The fans are the ones who really take YouTube to new levels. From finding videos which have never been watched before to making it easier to build playlists, there’s something for everyone here. 1. YouTube Go (Android): Download Videos and Save Data There are hundreds of ways to download YouTube videos to your hard drive, but this is the first official app to let you do that. Google launched YouTube Go a few months ago in India, with the aim to make YouTube access easier for those on slow or limited internet plans. YouTube Go lets users download videos in different qualities, thus saving data. It also shows previews of videos, which lets a user scan the whole clip without having to stream or download it. The best part, perhaps, is that you can share YouTube videos with others on the YouTube Go app without using any data. The app is now available for anyone to download You Can Now Test the Brand New YouTube App You Can Now Test the Brand New YouTube App YouTube Go is hiding in plain sight on the Google Play Store right now, so it would be rude not to give it a quick spin, right?! Read More on the Play Store, although be warned that it is still in its testing phase. Instead, you might need to manually install or side-load the app on Android How to Manually Install or Side Load Apps on Android How to Manually Install or Side Load Apps on Android Sideloading a file onto your Android device is easy, and we can show you how to do it. Read More by getting the APK file linked below. Download — YouTube Go for Android (Free) Download — YouTube Go APK from APK Mirror 2. Tubelister (Chrome): Turn YouTube Tabs Into Single Playlist Oh Tubelister, where have you been all my life? This right here is perhaps the most important Chrome extension for anyone who loves YouTube. In a nutshell, it will take all your open YouTube tabs and turn it into a single playlist. Most people open several YouTube tabs in the course of a browsing session. Not only does that slow down your browser, but you might just miss a video or two. Instead, get Tubelister and click the icon. All your tabs will be turned into a YouTube playlist, starting from the first to the last tab. The playlist won’t be automatically saved, so doing that will be up to you if you want to keep it for posterity. Think of it like OneTab for YouTube OneTab: Easily Share Your Browser’s Open Tabs OneTab: Easily Share Your Browser’s Open Tabs Read More . Download — Tubelister for Chrome (Free) 3. QueueTube (Chrome): Search YouTube Without Stopping Videos The biggest problem with YouTube is that if you are watching a video, you can’t search for more videos in the same tab. Do that and YouTube will stop the video to take you to a new page with the search results. Opening a new tab with YouTube messes with your flow. This is why you need QueueTube. With QueueTube, search results appear in the right-side pane where you usually see related videos. This way, you can continue searching for new things on YouTube and adding them to your playlist, without ever pausing your video. It’s one of the best extensions for Chrome, and it also works on any Chromium-based browser. So you can install the extension in Opera How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser Opera is making a case for you to switch to it. There's one small problem: extensions. What if you could install Chrome extensions in Opera? It's easy, so here's a quick guide. Read More and other browsers too. Download — QueueTube for Chrome (Free) 4. DJ2Q (Web): Collaborative Party Playlists Speaking of playlists, YouTube doesn’t let you share and collaborate on playlists. It’s a tad annoying, especially when you consider that YouTube can be the most powerful music player These Extensions Make YouTube the Powerful Music Player You Need These Extensions Make YouTube the Powerful Music Player You Need While Apple Music and Spotify slug it out, YouTube remains the best destination if you want to stream songs for free. The only thing better is if you pair it with the right extensions. Read More out there. Like with everything, there’s a way around that. DJ2Q is the best way to make a shared playlist for a party. Create your own room with a title, and start adding videos. Share the link with anyone you want, and your friends will add their own videos to the playlist. The host has full control over playback, and the songs play only from the host’s speakers, no one else’s. For anyone else with the link, they just get to add songs. It’s exceptionally easy to use, which is the hallmark of a great app to share music playlists 6 Awesome Ways to Find and Share Music Playlists 6 Awesome Ways to Find and Share Music Playlists Streaming music services are growing ever more popular, and this means the ability to create and share playlists with family and friends have got easier than ever. Here's how to do it. Read More . Note: In testing, we couldn’t add songs to the playlist once we signed in with our Facebook accounts. Our advice is to not login with Facebook and just use the app anonymously. 5.

Then on December 5th the company officially released Android 7.1.1 Nougat for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Pixel C tablet. Additionally, it’s available for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Below is everything you need to know about Nexus Android Nougat updates. Many of the features users love on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are exclusive to that phone. However, with Android 7.1.1 Nougat some are available for all Android devices, starting with Nexus phones. To kick-off January Google’s already released their latest Android 7.1.1 update and security bulletin. Read: Google Pixel Review: A New Generation of Android As promised, in December the final Android 7.1.1 Nexus update arrived for Nexus smartphones and tablets. Including the new Pixel. At this point all owners should have it, and can expect another update to arrive in January. Other manufacturers are working hard to deliver the same. Like Samsung and Motorola. Android 7.1.1 Nougat includes a few new features and additional tweaks over the original release, and more could be coming soon. The developer preview is over, Google released factory images and OTA files. At this point all Nexus devices should be on the new software. The first release had some new software features first shown off on the Pixel. Some of those included round icons, app shortcuts on the homescreen and launcher icons, image and GIF support in the keyboard, Night Light and more. The second developer preview looks to mostly be bug fixes, and added a slew of new emoji characters. Which Devices Are Getting Android 7.1.1 Nougat? Of course Google’s new Pixel and Pixel XL run the latest software, and they already received the newest version. Build NMF26O. Furthermore, the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel C tablet, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player are getting it too. Google claimed the Nexus 6 would be added on the 2nd preview, but that never happened. Android 7.1 is still missing for the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. That said, the Nexus 6 Android 7.1.1 update is finally available as of January 5th. In closing, those who were running the beta were oddly last to receive over the air updates to the official release. My Pixel C tablet didn’t get it until December 26th, and others could be experiencing the same problem. How to Get Android 7.1.1 Nougat There are multiple ways to install Android 7.1.1 Nougat today. The easiest of them all however, is to just wait for the over-the-air notification on your device. If you haven’t received it yet, follow any of the steps below. Join the Android 7.1 Nougat Beta (click here) and Enroll your device Download and Install the Factory Image (Instructions) Download and flash the OTA update files manually (click here) Read: Android 7.0 vs Android 6.0 Marshmallow: What’s New Alternatively users can manually install the factory image like many have been doing for years. This is more intensive, requires a full wipe and erase of the device, and is more involved. Then the third method is similar to the beta and over the air update, just done manually. Basically side-loading the update files. This takes some know-how, and will not erase your device. Those on the beta cannot side-load from it to the official build without a full wipe. Android 7.1.1 Nougat Release Date As of right now 7.1.1 Nougat is only available for the devices mentioned above, and running on Pixel phones. It was released on December 5th and now in 2017 everyone should have it. If you own the Nexus 6 by Motorola, we have good news. After a short wait Google released factory images and all files of Android 7.1.1 on January 5th. Enjoy it. In closing, those with a Nexus or Pixel are getting the January security patch starting on the 3rd. Expect OTAs to rollout for the first 7-10 days of January. Those with devices from Samsung and others will need to wait a little while longer for Nougat. Motorola and OnePlus are the few to already release Nougat for their devices. At this point there is no information to suggest Google is working on a version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat, but other maintenance releases could be on the way as 2017 continues. That all said for those who aren’t enjoying Nougat, here are fixes for any potential problems you may be facing. 17 Responses 10/20/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply Android 7.1 Developer Preview now available for Nexus 5X, 6P and Pixel C 11/28/2016 John Mitton Reply Google released final Android 7.1.1 Developer sample 2 for Nexus devices earlier this week.

My Nexus 5X has yet to receive 7.1.1 OTA on December 27. Update rollouts clearly take much longer than the 7-10 days the author suggests. 12/28/2016 Gohar Reply Awesome Nexus 6 Update Coming 12/29/2016 Jane Reply Nexus 6p no update as of 12/28. Husband’s 5x updated 2 weeks ago. 01/07/2017 Greg Stovall Reply It is now January 7, 2017, and my Nexus 5X, purchased from the Google store, still has not been offered the December 7.1.1 update. I also feel frustrated that my phone has been left out of the roll-out (despite being a Project Fi customer). I’ve done all the steps suggested by support folks (including factory data reset), but none of them have shaken loose an offer of 7.1.1. 01/12/2017 Goel Reply Finally received 3 OTAs yesterday for Nexus 5X.

Both Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa could be yours. How will these two giants coexist in a single smartphone? We don’t really know, but we are psyched to find out. Yesterday on Feb 27, Lenovo’s Motorola handset division and Amazon revealed at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that they will be partnering up to install the Alexa voice assistant into the new line of Moto Z smartphones that will be available later this year. This is really interesting because Motos run on the Android OS, which comes with Google’s Voice Assistant that is really robust. So why would you need another voice assistant? Furthermore, Motos run basic stock Android builds, there’s nothing more Android than a Moto (apart from the Google Pixel). We concede that Amazon’s smart-device Alexa seems to be all the rage nowadays, being an awesome assistant to answer questions and direct traffic since 2 years back. It will be quite easy to implement Alexa into Moto smartphones, because Android is an open-source system, so Google’s Assistant can be easily replaced with Alexa. From the beginning of this project, Lenovo and Amazon will focus on developing something called an Alexa Mod, which is a block that will attach directly to a Moto Z handset. These companies will then integrate Alexa straight into a list of Moto handsets and devices. This Mod will let users to perform daily tasks, such as texting, checking email, scrolling through the news, controlling a smart home device, call for an Uber amongst many others.

The latest platform version from Google has still not overshadowed Marshmallow and Lollipop when it comes to market reach but ever since the year started and before the MWC opened, more OEMs and carriers released their Nougat updates for several phones. We know more will make similar announcements in the coming weeks especially since Google is about to announce what ‘Android O’ or what Android dessert will be at the Google I/O 2017 Conference. ShortCutter was made by LeeDroid, an XDA-recognized developer who thought of the possibility of customization of the Quick Setting Tiles. This app can also allow websites or apps to launch easily. Definitely, ShortCutter can be a useful app as it lets you to toggle ambient display, immersive mode, or location mode. Custom Quick Settings for Android is limited but you will see its many advantages in the quick settings.

As much as Amazon's (AMZN)  Echo home speaker/voice assistant has turned into a surprise hit and yielded a blizzard of positive media attention, the Alexa voice assistant powering Echo hardware is still in key respects at a strategic disadvantage relative to Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) , Apple (AAPL) , and Microsoft's (MSFT)  rival offerings. Google and Apple's assistants each shipped with hundreds of millions of mobile devices last year, and Microsoft's perhaps on close to 200 million PCs. By contrast, Echo sales (judging by estimates) were likely only in seven figures. In theory, that would leave Google/Apple much better-positioned to create powerful third-party ecosystems for their assistants, as well as to optimize them in response to user voice commands. In practice, Amazon's all-out push to both improve Alexa and place it within as many devices as possible is making for a very interesting battle. Earlier this week, Lenovo's Motorola Mobility unit announced it plans to bundle Alexa with "most" of its phones going forward. Since then, Re/code has reported Amazon plans to launch one or two Alexa devices this year that will "allow people to initiate phone calls by voice," as well as let multiple devices function as a home or office's intercom system. And Amazon hardware news site AFTVnews has come across an image on Amazon's site that suggests the company plans to launch a home security camera with Alexa built in. All of this comes less than two months after dozens of Alexa-powered devices were shown off at CES by companies not named Amazon. These included Alexa-powered speakers, robots, refrigerators, TV sets and alarm clocks, as well as a Huawei Android phone. In addition, dozens of home electronics and appliance makers announced that their latest products can be controlled via Alexa. That last fact underscores how successful Amazon has been at creating a giant hardware, app and Internet service ecosystem for Alexa. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa now supports over 7,000 third-party "skills," up from just 1,000 last June. They cover everything from playing games to ordering Uber rides and Domino's pizzas to controlling home lights and thermostats to hearing sports scores and news stories. Google and Apple have taken a slower approach to building out their voice assistant ecosystems. Some Android developers have taken advantage of Google's Voice Interactions API, which launched in 2015 and lets users issue voice commands for third-party Android apps. And in December, Google Assistant, the next-gen service that evolved from the older Google Now, was opened up to developers. But currently, developers can only support interactions with the Google Home speaker. Android phone support will arrive later. Apple finally opened up Siri to developers last June, after having previously integrated the assistant with a handful of third-party apps. But for now, only six types of apps -- calling, messaging, payments, photo, workout and ride-hailing apps -- are supported. Apple has also seen a measure of adoption for its HomeKit platform, which launched in 2014 and allows smart home devices to be controlled via Siri commands. However, launches of Alexa-capable smart home products have been outpacing those of HomeKit-capable products, thanks in no small part to the fact that Apple places much stricter requirements on hardware partners than does Amazon. Amazon, meanwhile, seems intent on spending and partnering its way to success. Last May, Jeff Bezos said Amazon had over 1,000 people working on Alexa and the Echo line. A LinkedIn job search for "Amazon Alexa" currently turns up 896 openings at Amazon and a pair of subsidiaries. A search for "Amazon artificial intelligence" turns up 157 openings at the company, including many for Alexa units. That said, Google still appears to be a very formidable rival. In addition to being able to bundle Assistant with the world's most popular mobile operating system, the company's ability to integrate Assistant with Google Search and its massive Knowledge Graph, as well as with other Google services such as Maps and Gmail, is a valuable advantage. So are its tremendous AI investments, which help with things like maintaining a conversation with a user and understanding the meaning of natural-language commands. Apple, on the other hand, might be in a tougher spot. While Siri is guaranteed to maintain a large user base as long as it remains built into Apple hardware, even many Apple fans have been complaining it has been falling behind its rivals in both accuracy and functionality. And unlike Alexa or Google Assistant, it's unlikely that Siri will be baked into third-party smart home devices, given Apple's product philosophy. The stakes in this battle are pretty high, as more and more consumers warm to voice as a computing interface. Though they'll never fully replace the use of touchscreens, keyboards and mice, the enhancements (via AI algorithms and other means) made to voice search and assistant platforms as they take in more user data, along with their growing usefulness as more products and services join an ecosystem, is clearly producing a sea change. In May, Google disclosed a fifth of all the searches it handled via its mobile app and Android devices involved voice. For Google, the rise of voice presents some monetization challenges, since it can lower the number of times a user making a query sees the text-based search ads that remain by far Google's biggest profit engine. But the company is clearly better off embracing the trend with a service that integrates Google Search -- and in many cases turns up a search results page to go with a voice reply -- rather than ceding the space to rival services. Google, for its part, argues that a lot of voice search activity complements rather than cannibalizes text-based searches, and thus expands its addressable market. Amazon, meanwhile, benefits from Alexa's growing popularity both via hardware sales and the integration of its e-commerce and digital content services with the platform. Indeed, it might be a little too easy to place an Amazon order via Alexa. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) powers many third-party Alexa Skills through its AWS Lambda service, though it's also possible for developers to use another cloud provider. Given what we've seen over the first couple months of the year, it's likely many more home and mobile devices featuring Alexa will be unveiled over the next 10. It's also likely that makers of smart home products will start to treat Alexa integration as no-brainer, and that the number of total skills supported by the platform will surge past 10,000. This is a battle where Amazon, ironically, has been more of a plucky upstart than an entrenched giant. But it can no longer be considered much of an underdog.

Google’s note-taking app Keep joins G Suite, now integrates with Google Docs Posted Feb 28, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story BMW says ‘nein’ to Android Auto Google Keep, a competitor to note-taking apps like Evernote and Microsoft’s OneNote, is today being integrated into Google’s suite of applications aimed at businesses, G Suite (previously, Google Apps for Your Domain). This allows Keep to become a part of users’ workflow for capturing ideas, jotting down quick reminders or to-dos, creating checklists, taking meeting notes and more. Along with its addition to G Suite, Google Keep is also now being integrated with Google Docs. That means you’ll be able to drag and drop notes from Keep into your work documents, Google explains. This feature is available via the web only, and requires you first have Docs loaded and open in your browser. Then, you’ll access the Keep notepad from the Tools menu, which places your Keep notes into a sidebar within the Docs user interface. From there, you’ll be able to grab the notes, including images and checklists, and pull them right into your document. In addition, you’re able to search your Keep notes from Google Docs, as well as add a new note to Keep while you’re working in Docs. To accomplish this latter task, you’ll select the text in your document, then right-click on the selection and choose “Save to Keep notepad.” What’s clever about this integration is that the note also will include a link back to the source document when it’s added this way. The move to expand Keep beyond its consumer user base makes sense, given that many business, government and education users may have already been using the app on their own. As a part of G Suite, those business-focused notes can now be kept securely within the company’s own domain, where they can be managed, supported and made searchable. Keep is available to G Suite customers as of today, where it can be used on Android, iOS, Chrome or web. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Keep Description Google Keep is an app that lets you easily create notes on the go.

Image Credit: Drew Tarvin/Flickr Google today enhanced its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) public cloud infrastructure offering with new virtual machine (VM) instances that boast up to 64 virtual central processing unit (CPU) cores, effectively providing more computing power for applications. They’re available now in beta for all users and projects out of Google’s data center zones that run Intel’s Haswell and Broadwell chips. There are three available flavors in the Google Compute Engine (GCE): a standard instance called n1-standard-64, a high-memory instance called n1-highmem-64, and an instance with high CPU-to-memory ratio called n1-highcpu-64. They’re all available from Google’s web-based Cloud Console and in the command-line interface (CLI) with the Google Cloud SDK. Google has been taking many steps to become more competitive with other public clouds. The biggest one, Amazon Web Services (AWS), does offer machines with 64 vCPUs. There are even 128 vCPU machines available from AWS. Currently, Microsoft Azure, the second biggest cloud, does not have machines with more than 32 vCPUs. Google followed AWS and Azure and introduced a key management service in January. People with free trials will need to ask for a quota increase in order to spin up one of the new instances — if you try to create one with a free trial, you’ll receive an error saying you’ve reached a limit of 24 CPUs. “We’ll improve the way quotas work in the near future so that it will be possible to create a 32-core instance for new, free trial users, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. Google’s prowess in getting big customers for its cloud was proven last month, when Snap, the newly public company behind Snapchat, revealed that it had a $2 billion contract with the Google Cloud.

The city’s councilors are to cast final votes on the plan March 7. With a considerable degree of understatement, Google’s project consultants described the colossal main structure on the campus as “a building form not typically described in standard city codes.” Indeed, it’s a building form not typically found outside science fiction. With two levels rising above a massive basement containing a utility plant, the 595,000-square-foot structure would boast a scalloped canopy roof tiled with solar panels and inset with skylight-windows. Artist’s rendering of Google’s proposed Charleston East campus (City of Mountain View) At its highest point, the building, between Amphitheatre Parkway and Charleston Road in Mountain View’s North Bayshore area, would be about 112 feet tall. While there’s no shortage in the artist’s renderings of happy, shiny, Googley young folks, the images show humans not typically well represented at Google: children and old people. That’s because the 18.7-acre campus features areas open to the public, including a park, a plaza and, on the ground floor of the main building, various pavilions, plus public amenities along an interior path or “artery.” “Cafes and shops dot the artery to create a bustling social and retail destination open to both Googlers and the wider public,” the planning documents said. “Smaller meandering paths between the pavilions provide quieter and more intimate spaces for collaboration and private conversation.” Artist’s rendering of Google’s proposed Charleston East campus (City of Mountain View) Also planned is a sculpture garden, with art “more like ‘Burning Man’ installations and less like ‘do not touch’ museum installations,” according to the planning documents. A “green loop” with “savanna-like habitat” would connect the campus to the nearby Googleplex campus, through Charleston Park. Artist’s rendering of Google’s proposed Charleston East campus (City of Mountain View) To help prevent deaths of birds from hitting windows, an ornithologist was brought in, and glass will be used that is neither highly reflective nor perfectly transparent, as windows with those characteristics can contribute to avian fatalities. Construction is expected to take 2 1/2 years and would start after Google received approval for the campus from Mountain View city council, and a building permit.   Image: Artist’s rendering of Google’s proposed Charleston East campus (City of Mountain View) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: campus, Charleston East, city council, Google, Mountain View, photos, plans   More Posts in Big Tech Elon Musk, Tim Cook top Page, Pichai, Zuckerberg and Gates as ‘visionaries’ in survey of tech leaders March 6, 2017   Dear Elon, I have an idea… March 2, 2017   Google spinoff Waymo vs Uber: Does Uber have a defense against claim of self-driving car secrets theft?

The company received a patent for a baseball cap with a stills-and-video camera mounted on the brim. Photos and video could be beamed via social media to a users’ friends and even allow for live interaction with another user, the patent indicated. The hat’s brim would have a receptacle to hold the removable camera. The potential for users to share photos and videos straight from the device would one-up makers of wearable cameras that store imagery for later uploads, the patent suggested. “Some cameras are designed to be attached to a helmet or another place on a person’s body for capturing video clips of events,” according to the patent. “These cameras typically record and store video clips of an event, and a person can later move the video clips onto a computer. “The (Google Hat) camera system is configured to connect, via the wireless communications module and a mobile computing device, to a social networking server.” But the technology is not just about real-time virtual socializing – the hat-mounted camera could save a user from attack, the patent indicated. It would do so by connecting a Google Hat wearer’s video feed to emergency services during a threatening situation, essentially allowing the user to show or tell a possible assailant that they’re on camera. “The user can activate an emergency situation indicator and cause the wearable camera system to transmit a video feed to an appropriate emergency handling system, potentially deterring a dangerous person near the user,” the patent said. Although Google Glass floundered to its death in the mass market over privacy concerns (the firm is still pursuing specialized applications for the technology), the Google Hat and another device patented Feb. 28 suggest the company retains faith in a broad market for wearable cameras. The just-granted patent for a “camera bracelet” provides little more than drawings, but shows a sleek device with a digital display and what appear to be two camera lenses. Much patented technology never sees the light of day, so there’s no guarantee the Google Hat or camera bracelet will ever be available for sale. However, the volume of personal data these devices could collect would certainly be a boon for Google, whose use of such information for selling targeted ads is the crux of the business model.

PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY Hulk Hogan Gets a Big Payday From Gawker and We’re All Poorer For It     Francoise Shaibend: Anatomy of Sex, Money, Marriage Scam on Google Plus CELEBRITIES Google Sex Scam Queen: 'Devil in Flesh of a Fairy' Preys on Lonely Heart Men Mystery Woman at Center of Multiple Scams By Keith Girard, March 22nd, 2016 She goes by several names and is at the center of several Google Plus sex and marriage scams. But the identity of this strikingly beautiful woman remains a mystery. (Photo: Google Plus) Google sex and marriage scams all have one thing in common, a strikingly attractive woman. The are diverse, invariably young and desperately seeking true love, marriage and children. But no one has figured into more scams than an angel-faced beauty described by one victim as a “devil in the flesh of a fairy.” Her name is Carine, or Miriam, or Liliane, depending on any one of several profiles posted on Google Plus, according to an IM special investigation of the search engine’s social media site. Third in a Series The scams appear to be based out of France, or the former French colonies of Ivory Coast and Mali. The latter are hotbeds of extremist Islamic groups. Only last week Ivory Coast was rocked by a deadly terror attack. A terrorist connection could not be determined by the limited scope of IM’s investigation. But we discovered concrete evidence that organized groups are running the scams out of the terrorist hotbeds. One group also revealed a Luxembourg connection, suggesting it had roots in Europe as well. Given the lack of safeguards on Google’s social media site and the ease that fake profiles can be created, groups like al Qaeda could easily be perpetrating similar scams to raise money for terror attacks. So far, Google has not returned calls to answer questions about the abuse of its social media service. ‘Carine’ sent this enticing photo during our first conversation. Her goal was obvious. She was throwing out bait to hook her prey. It’s hard to know how effective the scams are. But they are pursued aggressively by the predators who operate them. One of the woman’s profiles had more than 800 connections, all men in their 30s to early 60s. The conversations began casually enough over Google Chat, also known as a Google Hangout. The service is noted for its privacy. In some cases Skype is also used. Soon enough, the conversation turns to love and marriage and invariably ends with a plea for money. The mystery woman first contacted us using the Google profile of a woman named Carine Surgers. It said she worked for Medical Pharmacies Group Inc., a French conglomerate. The profile said she attended St Therese’s School, girl’s Catholic school in Caen, a town in Northwest France, where she also said she lived. Although she provided a fairly detailed backstory about her life, several discrepancies quickly raised red flags. As it turned, out she’d stolen the identity used on the profile. We discovered the profile of the real Carine Surgers on a French executive networking site. Despite claiming to be a devout Catholic who attended church everyday, she knew surprisingly little about French Catholicism. Her profile said she lived in Caen, but her Skype account said she was located in Marseille in the south of France. During our conversations, Carine kept sending a steady steam of photos, each more risque than the next. During our initial conversations, she said she was traveling to the Ivory Coast to close out some of her father’s business affairs following his death. In fact, she may be based out of the African country. A trace of her computer’s IP address led to the Abidjan, the country’s major industrial city. A retired French executive who has traveled extensively in the Middle East and Africa, including the Ivory Coast, said Carine’s language skills were rudimentary. That suggested French was her second language, or that she could be an native of French equatorial Africa. The executive, who assisted with IM’s investigation in exchange for remaining anonymous, was also contacted by the mystery women and told the same story we’d heard. She was in the Ivory Coast on business while desperately searching for true love on the Internet. In fact, the woman may have been only tangentially involved in the scam, or possibly even not at all. Sessions recorded by IM during our investigation revealed that at least one man posed as her on Skype. During most conversations, we asked Carine to video verify her identity over Skype. She always complied. But we later learned the videos were pre-recorded. We simply asked her to perform easy tasks, like holding up fingers, touching her nose, or flashing a peace sign. She never did. It was also possible to tell, from changes in phrasing and syntax, that we were talking with different people at different times. All conversations were in writing in French. The woman pictured here claimed to be Miriam Delpech from Mali. The photo inset is from her Google profile. The woman is identical to ‘Carine.’ That led to our conclusion the scam was an organized effort likely involving several people. Lonely heart scams are as old as the Internet and sprang up with the proliferation of online-dating sites. Most major sites have since cracked down on fake profiles making it harder for scammers to operate. But Google’s social media site appears to be a wide open and a haven for scammers. Russian and Eastern European organized crime groups were behind early scams. There’s no reason to believe terror groups haven’t adopted their tactics to scam money from unwitting victims. The mystery surrounding “Carine” deepened when we discovered another Google profile featuring her. This time, the name on her profile was Miriam Delpech. She declined to video verify, claiming she did not know how to use Skype and would only talk on Google chat. Miriam’s story is similar to Carine’s with a few changes in detail. She said she lived in Mali, a former French colony that borders the Ivory Coast. She added that she lived with her mother and sister and worked as a waitress in a restaurant.

We asked her to verify her identity with a photo. The woman in the photo was identical to Carine. There is no indication the two scams are related, even though their background stories were similar as was their quest to find love on the Internet. But both the Mali and Ivory Coast groups had numerous photos of the same women the each claimed to be.

But she would never talk on the microphone that made me suspicious and once I went on the Internet to see other scammers, her pictures and videos were all over and they marched the pictures she had sent me… She seems smart when she starts but becomes dumb when she starts asking money so quick and by doing so exposes herself as scammer. Now that I have done a wast research on her, all she does is places bait to other lonely people in the world. I told her why do you beg for money and not work like normal people do and she made an excuse of not finding work. My conclusion at this time is that the person we are talking to may not be even a women it may very well be a man on the other side posing as a women searching for love, and marriage. She has given me her address and the only way someone could shed some light on this mystery is to go to Ghana, in the city of Kumasi and investigate who this person is???? Steve brooks Try the name jennifer obiri. From ghana and all her buddies Ilie Enache please check out on skype her name:natalie.luis1 now he used name of Maryline Tanner form Niles state Michigan…. RomanceScamsNow.com You do realize those photos are stolen by the scammer from a real person, right? kredacter Yes, you are right, in many cases the photos are stolen. But in this case, we video verified her identity on Skype. Plus, she has sent us more than a dozen photos in all manner of poses. Typically, when photos are stolen, a scammer may only have a few. That’s why it’s always important to ask for multiple photos if engaging someone you don’t know on social media. As it turns out, the video was faked as well. RomanceScamsNow.com Not sure how you “verified” her identity on Skype, but scammers easily fake skype video calls. This is very big business, and while some scammers are dumb, overall they have better tools than most victims. In short, you should be very cautious about the allegation, because we only know of a single webcam/porn star that has connections to the scammers, and even then, she is not conducting the scams, We have 25 years tracking scammers, and would love to share more with you. http://romancescamsnow.com/dating-scams/fake-webcam-footage-fools-online-daters-into-falling-for-scam-artists/   Article Reprints   Subscribe To TheImproper's Email Newsletters, Free!

Real Estate Why It's So Hard To Build The Next Silicon Valley BLOOMBERG NEWS 3/03/2017 Reprints When Brandon Schatz learned in December 2012 that Kansas City, Kan., had become the first city in the nation to get Google Fiber, a superfast internet service, he started making plans to move his nascent sports photography business there. The day after Christmas, he drove the 165 miles from his home in Springfield, Mo., to check it out. By Feb. 1, he had settled into his new house. By Feb. 4, he was connected to the network.  That was exactly what officials had wanted. When the area (first Kansas City, Kan., with Kansas City, Mo., added weeks later) won a challenge to be the first to get Google Fiber, local boosters celebrated, hoping to kick-start an economic renaissance: attracting entrepreneurs, cultivating emerging business districts, and becoming known as a major startup hub. Four years later, Schatz's company Sportsphotos.com, which takes photos of amateur sporting events around the country, is growing slowly. He's taking full advantage of the speedy internet, uploading hundreds of high-resolution photos in minutes from races and other matches. But the business isn't yet where he wants it to be, and for now Schatz's main source of income is web development work and renting out rooms in his home on Airbnb. On a recent Sunday, Schatz sat in his home, where he also operates his company, pecking away at a desktop, surrounded by pizza boxes. "I thought we would be huge already," he said. Misplaced Expectations Schatz's disappointment is a tale of misplaced expectations, by both entrepreneurs and city leaders. In 2011 the cities' two mayors called Fiber's then-future deployment "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," and a way to "spark economic development." And for Google, which since significantly has pared down support for the project, it was a case of placing too much faith in the ability of its own technology to change lives. A Google Fiber team member in 2012 answers a Kansas City-area resident's question about when a local school will have access to high-speed internet service. (Jill Toyoshiba/MCT/Newscom) It's also been hard for the Kansas City area to become the boom town that leaders dreamed of. Some entrepreneurs, like Schatz, were drawn to the city because of the fiber, and some launched businesses. A "startup village" sprang up. But few of the companies really took off, and some frustrated founders ended up decamping to San Francisco, where there was a larger talent pool and greater access to capital. Even the best of intentions and superspeedy internet isn't enough to create a new Silicon Valley. Every year after the first fiber connections lit up for Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in late 2012, greater Kansas City's GDP growth has fallen well short of the national average. In 2015, it was just 1.5%, compared to 2.6% for the nation as a whole. Metro regional numbers aren't yet available for all of 2016, although based on state numbers through the third quarter, both Kansas and Missouri seem to be beating the national average. "We're scratching our heads a little bit," said Jeff Pinkerton of the Mid America Regional Council, a nonprofit that conducts economic research for greater Kansas City. "Why is Kansas City really not taking off, especially with this asset like Google Fiber?" Google came to town in 2011. At Wyandotte High School auditorium, on the Kansas side, blue, red, yellow and green spotlights shone on a parade of dignitaries who addressed the audience. Google founder Sergey Brin spoke on a prerecorded video. After the announcement about fiber going into Kansas City, a Google vice president invited the crowd to a barbecue-laden celebration. Kansas City beat out more than 1,000 other cities for the debut Google fiber project, which aimed to compete against the telecommunications and cable giants that have dominated the market for internet access. Some analysts believed the ultimate goal was to encourage those competitors to improve their own services and thus the internet experience overall, which would bolster the environment for Alphabet's most lucrative business: online search. Mayors of both cities announced a team of civic leaders to figure out how best to leverage fiber, in entrepreneurship as well as other areas such as education. The group released a plan in 2012 that made recommendations ranging from nurturing technology districts to supporting tax credits for small technology businesses to creating mentor networks. An Incubator For Startups Despite budget challenges, the state of Kansas has stuck by a pre-existing income tax credit of up to $50,000 for angel backers who invest in a young company. Working with a group called Techstars, Kansas City-based Sprint (S) created an incubator for startups. The Kauffman Foundation, a think tank based in Kansas City, Mo., started a weekly gathering for entrepreneurs. An area straddling State Line Road, the border, became the first neighborhood that Google wired for fiber, and a community of founders sprang up. The district, which had zoning laws that made it easier to run a business from home, became known as Startup Village. That's where Schatz, the owner of Sportsphotos.com, moved into a rental house. It was an online video about the Kansas City experiment that drew him. He realized that Google Fiber could be the key to his nascent business: Batches of photos that took 40 to 50 hours to upload would be done in less than one. "It's a little nerdy, to see this video and be all kinds of inspired," says Schatz, 34, a boyish looking former U.S. Army sergeant whose tours of duty included Bosnia. "But I was inspired." Yet in practice, a dazzling internet connection didn't mean much for some businesses. Mike Farmer operated his startup, Leap, a search engine, out of a Startup Village house for a while. "What do you do with gigabit speed that makes the experience more relevant?" he recalls asking his team. They goofed around with ideas, such as having search results take the form of several high-definition Netflix movies streaming at the same time. Given that most users wouldn't have gigabit internet, Leap never did find the right scenario. Farmer wound down the business last year. "The true power of Google fiber is exposure," says Matthew Marcus, executive director of the Kansas City Startup Foundation and co-leader of the Startup Village, referring to the publicity the technology brought to the city's startup community. "The fact is, it's really difficult to consume one gigabit of speed." In Search Of Talent And Capital Some startups have contended with the lack of access to a big talent pool. Tech companies in Silicon Valley, Waterloo, Canada, and New York City, tend to hire from nearby universities with strong software-engineering programs. The schools with the strongest engineering schools in the region are more than two hours away from Kansas City, though.Funding has also been a problem in Kansas City. Entrepreneurs lamented that local investors looked for the type of traction that would merit tens of millions of dollars from Silicon Valley venture firms. But if businesses achieve that, Midwestern venture firms invest just single-digit millions. Lack of access to capital contributed to the departure of two promising Kansas City startups, bond marketplace Neighborly and green-homebuilder Acre, which both moved most operations to Silicon Valley. "There are plenty of angels that will write $50,000 checks, but there's not that much bridge," says Sandy Kemper, chief executive officer of Fairway, Kansas-based C2FO, a working-capital finance company he founded in 2008. Kemper turned to big investors outside Kansas City, including San Francisco's Mithril Capital and Singapore's Temasek Holdings, for most of his backing. In his hometown, "there is a finer filter, and maybe a little bit higher hurdle." One advantage cited by many local entrepreneurs, low costs, can actually backfire. "It might be a misplaced sense of comfort," says Ajay Royan, the general partner at Mithril Capital who invested in C2FO. He believes the best entrepreneurs work with an intensity driven by the reality of global competition — a reality too easily lost sight of in a low-pressure, low-cost environment. "If you get comfortable with the fact that things seem to be going well in Kansas City," he says, and don't think beyond it, "that's bad." C2FO is one many other entrepreneurs hope will eventually list on a public market and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, with a valuation north of a billion. It has already raised $99 million and is used by some of the world's biggest companies, including Acer, Costco (COST), Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) BNSF Railway, and Pfizer (PFE). That type of public offering, more than anything, would truly foster entrepreneurship in Kansas City, entrepreneurs say. It would show existing investors the upside of investing more than a few thousand dollars in startups, along with creating a class of richly rewarded early employees who would in turn likely become investors in other startups — or founders of their own. Lance LeMay, a venture capitalist at Kansas City, Mo.-based Open Air Equity Partners who invested in Kemper's and Farmer's companies, said boosting the venture-backed startup ecosystem in Kansas City won't even take that much. "More than a billion-dollar exit, you need lots of successful exits," he said. "You don't need a home run. You need lots of doubles." Fiber's Impact In the years that Kansas City has been trying to make the most out of Fiber, Google has been doing the same. In early days, company executives talked it up, with executive chairman Eric Schmidt telling conference goers in late 2012 that of all the company's current innovations, including self-driving cars, it was Google's "most compelling on many levels," something that "changes your life." Shortly afterward, it started announcing more cities for the project, beginning with Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah. In 2013, the company recruited Craig Barratt, a wireless chip industry veteran, to lead the group that included Fiber. In 2015, when Google became Alphabet, Barratt was given the title of CEO. Over time, Google Fiber announced it would expand into 21 cities. But just as Kansas City might have overestimated the asset that Google Fiber could become, Google overestimated Fiber's impact, and its expansion plans deflated. Barratt left in October 2016, surprising many employees. The same day, the unit announced it was stalling expansion plans in eight cities and cutting 9% of its staff. This month, Alphabet hired Barratt's replacement, broadband executive Gregory McCray, and further slimmed Fiber, shifting hundreds of its employees over to Google's core internet business. Fiber is now in only nine locations, including Atlanta and Orange County, Calif. Other Bets, the part of Alphabet that Google Fiber belongs to, reported losses of $3.58 billion last year on revenue of $809 million. It also contributed to Other Bets' $1.39 billion in capital expenditures. A number of factors lay behind Fiber's strategic shift. Former employees said a chief reason was the discrepancy between the desires of Google's co-founders to expand the service and make it faster and the demanding costs of providing it. Cable incumbents moved aggressively, introducing similar high-speed services at low prices. Unexpected political hurdles emerged. In Louisville, Ky., for instance, AT&T (T) and Charter Communications (CHTR) sued Google Fiber over a wonky utility-bill regulation. "Google invested in Fiber during a time when it was willing to make lots of big investments with uncertain or long-term returns, but over the last couple of years Google has become a different place," says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "It doesn't necessarily make sense for Alphabet to continue to invest in it as heavily at this point." Schatz recently changed his business model. Instead of getting amateur athletes to pay for the photos, they download them for free, with sponsorship fees providing his revenue. Having observed the reluctance of local investors to back companies that lack strong income, he is working to build relationships with big sports retailers and fitness companies that could sponsor the blanket photography of the events he shoots. The race-photography business alone is worth $20 million to $50 million annually a year on sponsorships, he calculates; add in other amateur sports and expanded marketing initiatives and it could be exponentially more. But for now, he's capturing just a tiny portion; revenue last year doubled but was still under $100,000, he says. This year, he hopes to keep growing and achieve profitability. He knows developing ties to potential sponsors would be much easier in a city like New York or Los Angeles, but he believes he can pull it off from the heartland. Sometimes, he thinks back to advice a venture capitalist gave him a few years ago, to drop everything else and focus only on his business. The laid-back atmosphere in Kansas City made it easier to put that advice aside, he says. "It probably would have been good to have extra pressure," he says now. Still, he says perks such as a community of fellow entrepreneurs make him happy he stayed put. Meanwhile, some of the original startup supporters in Startup Village have sold their real estate to non-entrepreneurs. After Google Fiber came to town, Brad Feld, a venture capitalist at Boulder, Colo.-based Foundry Group bought a bungalow in Startup Village for use, gratis, by a promising young company. For a time, Leap's Farmer housed interns there. Today, a startup engineer lives in the house. On a recent visit, a layer of dark fuzz and grime obscured floors. A vacuum cleaner stood at the far end of the main room, plugged in but apparently unused. A side room lacked furniture, but did sport a large pile of clothing flung in its center. A skittish cat bolted across the kitchen. Three doors down the street, Schatz has decided to launch an intense search for financial backers. An early port of call: Silicon Valley.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Outlook 2016 for Mac supports Google Calendar and… Outlook 2016 for Mac supports Google Calendar and Contacts for Office Insiders By Mark Coppock — March 1, 2017 1:57 PM Subscribe Share Microsoft Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Microsoft gives you another reason to become an Office Insider, with enhanced Google account support for Outlook 2016 for Mac. Office 2016 for Mac has gone a long way to bringing Mac users the same experience as those running on Microsoft’s own Windows platform. Gone are the days of Office for Mac having its own user interface and feature set, and now Mac owners can even take part in the same Office Insider preview program as Windows users. Outlook 2016 has seen as much of an overhaul as any Office application for MacOS and now Microsoft is bringing enhanced support for Google Calendar and Contacts to the Mac. If you’re a part of the Office Insider Fast Ring community, then the most recent update lets you use more of what Google has to offer in the way of managing your time and relationships. More: Microsoft’s Office Insider now has its very own Insider Fast Ring Up until now, Outlook 2016 for Mac only supported connecting to and managing Gmail accounts. That meant Mac users could get access to their Google email, but nothing else. Now, Microsoft is adding the ability to sync Google Calendar and Contact accounts as well, with the same add, delete, and time and location editing functionality as was previously available only with Outlook. In addition, Outlook 2016 for Mac also now supports some Gmail-specific Outlook.com, Office 365, and Exchange email features as well. First is the new Focused Inbox functionality that breaks email messages into “Focused” and “Other” tabs based on what Microsoft’s machine intelligence decides is important and urgent email. Outlook 2016 for Mac also now supports the same rich experiences for travel reservations and package deliveries that have been arriving for other Microsoft email clients. As is often the case, you will need to be an Office Insider in the Fast Ring to gain the earliest access to these new features. You can sign up to be an Office Insider by opening Outlook 2016 for Mac, going to Help > Check for Updates, and following these instructions. Not everyone will gain immediate access to the complete Google account support right away, however, as Microsoft will be monitoring the experience and inviting specific users. You will be prompted to add the support when you are added to the list.
Digital Trends Home > Computing > Google is improving its Safe Browsing features to… Google is improving its Safe Browsing features to protect MacOS users By Jonathan Keane — March 1, 2017 2:28 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Google is taking steps to ensure users are protected from the latest attacks targeting Mac computers. Safe Browsing, Google’s in-browser warning system, has announced a number of new updates to help protect against malware in MacOS. MacOS users should expect to see more warnings in the future, advising them on malicious activity on the sites they are visiting. Safe Browsing is used in Firefox and Safari, not just Chrome. According to a blog post on Wednesday, Safe Browsing is turning its attention to two common browser abuses — ad injection and manipulation of Chrome settings. Some of the most common Chrome setting changes relate to the changing of the start page, homepage, and default search engine, which Google is trying to stem. Google also recently released the Chrome Settings API for Mac to help develops set safer settings for users. Starting March 31, Chrome will alert users when changes are being made to their settings that didn’t go through this API. “Also, developers should know that only extensions hosted in the Chrome Web Store are allowed to make changes to Chrome settings,” it added in the blog post. More: This new Mac malware freezes your computer with email drafts The updates from Google come at a pertinent time for MacOS users. Mac malware has become much more common with new strains regularly being discovered. While it’s still nowhere near the levels of malware affecting Windows devices, it should still be a cause for concern for any Mac user. Security researchers discovered a fresh attack recently that abuses Microsoft Word doc macros to deliver malware. It’s long been a trick used to infect Windows computers. Wrongdoers are getting inventive too. Just earlier this year, a Mac-specific technique carried out denial of service attacks on victims by launching hundreds of email drafts at once, causing the device to crash. Also at the recent RSA security conference, there was much talk about the proliferation of Mac malware and we should expect to see more emerging this year.
News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google App Beta Testing Brings ‘Visual Search’ While Gboard Gets Translator Icon By Zara Ali Mar 3, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Google started rolling out a beta update for its Google app, last night. The new beta update brings minor changes to the app and brings the app to version 6.14. However, these small changes suggest that the tech giant is working on enhanced image search tool and adding photo-centric features. The company has not made these changes live yet, but they will soon be available from the navigation menu. There will be a new “visual search” option in the app that is integrated with a camera to perform the search functions. Users will able to select a part of the image and then choose from a series of search results in a card-like format that are relative to the picture. On tapping on one result, the entire search result opens in detail. This is not the first time when Google has come up with an in-app image search feature. Earlier, there was Screen search (formerly known as Now on Tap). It is a right move for Google to integrate a dedicated visual search feature in the app. Even though Google Assistant will soon be a part of many Android devices, but it also lacks image search function. Besides, Google has also added other features such as “saves” in the navigation slider for Google Images. The Saves feature organises all the saved items and tags. Both “visual search” and “Saves” features are not live on regular Google app yet, but the company will soon roll them out officially for non-beta users as well. You can sign up here for Google beta test program. Advertisement In another news, Google Gboard keyboard beta version has also got various new features with a new update. The app now houses Google Translate option, which will translate texts in a jiffy with single tap. It will save a lot of time as users would no longer require to open a separate app or browser to translate text. Not just translation function, the app has also got a new theme selector, which will let users personalise Gboard’s outlook. The theme selector is boradly divided into categories like Landscapes section, Solid Colors, and more. Furthermore, the Gboard can also predict emojis now and supports a new language – Bashkir. If you cannot wait for an official rollout, then you can participate in the beta testing program for Gboard. Click on this link to sign up.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft should bring its Photos app to the iPhone and Android 1 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Mar 3, 2017 at 22:30 GMT3 days ago Photography is one of the most used services on mobile devices with manufacturers of modern flagship devices like Samsung’s S7, the Google Pixel and the Huawei P10 taking pains to let prospective buyers know just how much better their cameras are than those of rivals. While Microsoft (by way of its partnership with the then influential phone manufacturer Nokia) had been on the forefront of the mobile camera revolution – providing the software and hardware that helped power the amazing cameras found in champions like the Lumia 1020, 830, 930 and 950 a few years ago, the firm’s role in mobile photography is more limited now. For iPhone and Android users, most will only think of Microsoft and photo storage when installing the OneDrive app which serves as a bridge between ecosystems for Microsoft users allowing them to store and retrieve files between various devices. For Mobile users, there is a clear emphasis on photography. Microsoft’s OneDrive app on both iOS and Android stores photos automatically tags them, organizes them and for all intents and purposes can act as a full-fledged photos app if need be. However, unlike Google which provides both a Google Drive app and a Google Photos app, Microsoft does not provide a Photos app for non-Windows devices. For PCs and phones with Windows 10, Microsoft’s Photos app is the default photo gallery app which integrates with OneDrive’s backend to provide a modern photo experience which is comparable and in some ways superior to competitors like Apple Photos and Google Photos. A Microsoft Photos app on iOS and Android could take the position of Google Photos for many users who are otherwise embedded in the Microsoft ecosystem. Personally, in my case, I rarely use the Google Photos app on iPhone. I view my Photos on two places, my phone and my Surface (with my Android phone relegated as a media player/Netflix in bed machine). Currently, OneDrive is the bridge between these two devices, with photos captured by the iPhone’s slick camera automatically uploaded to OneDrive and appearing on my PC within minutes Microsoft already has a camera app for the iPhone – two in fact. A gallery app which collates all your photos and makes photo management better on the iPhone would go a long way in unifying a PC and mobile experience. Now, I know I’ve been using iOS as an example here but there’s no reason the same couldn’t be accomplished on Android devices. and even better with many Android devices being able to change and set default apps. Many of Microsoft’s core apps are already on mobile platforms, what’s one more app from a company best known for its software?

Microsoft and Google Defeat Apple in Schools As iPads and MacBooks Hit New Low GO Research shows use of Apple devices collapses in the US Mar 3, 2017 22:37 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft and Google both experienced substantial increases in the education sector, while Cupertino-based rival Apple hit a new low last year, according to a new report. Futuresource Consulting says in a research that Google is the leading choice in the classroom in the United States, while Microsoft’s Windows has become the runner-up. At the same time, Apple’s devices have turned from leaders to one of the last choices, losing ground lately due to the lack of innovations. Specifically, the research shows that, in the United States, Chromebooks are the number one choice with no less than 58 percent share, while Windows comes second with 22 percent. iOS fell to third place with 14 percent, down from 19 percent, while Linux is the last one with 5 percent. Chromebooks experienced the biggest change versus 2015, as it managed to improve shipments by 8 percent. A total of 12.6 million devices were sold to schools in 2016, and more than half of them were Chromebooks, the research indicates. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, Windows is the dominating choice here with 65 percent, while Android is second with 17 percent. iOS is third with 9 percent, followed by Chrome OS with 6 percent. Microsoft and Google likely to continue growth Both Microsoft and Google are expected to grow in education, mostly as a result of investments in 2-in-1s and the growing number of OEMs building devices that come with detachable keyboards. 2-in-1 devices have become Microsoft’s own obsession, as the Redmond-based software giant itself pioneered this product category with its own Surface lineup. These devices bring a series of advantages for customers in the education sectors, as they can be used as both tablets and laptops, having a detachable keyboard and touchscreen. “Both Microsoft and Google (and their respective partners) have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300. The 2-in-1 form factor is ideal for education, providing schools with flexibility in usage,” the research reads. Apple is also investing in 2-in-1s, but the bigger price point seems to significantly affect adoption in schools, so it’ll be interesting to see how Cupertino tackles the growth of Google and Microsoft in this industry. #Microsoft#Google#Apple#Surface#Windows subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Loses First Place to Apple in NZ 2-in-1 Battle Better Late than Never: Microsoft Surface Now Supports Wake on LAN New Windows Phone Spotted at MWC 2017 MediaTek Says No to Windows 10 on ARM Because It’s a Risky Idea Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Android Pay Now Available in Belgium After Samsung Pay Expanded to India Italy Blocks RARBG, Flashx, Other Torrent Sites Microsoft Brings Outlook on Apple’s MacBook Touch Bar Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge    Apple losing ground in US schools New Apps FileFriend: With this simple and lightweight piece of software, you can split, join and password protect files, including images so no one can view their contents JD-GUI: A useful application that was designed to provide a fast Java decompiler and reduce the time and energy you spend on your projects Box Sync: Official client from Box Sync, the alternative to Dropbox services with so much for space, enabling you to access the cloud files on your devices IP Watch: Keep track of dozens of IP address from the devices you are monitoring in the network and get alerts whenever the status changes with this tool TCP Optimizer: A network connection tweaking tool that enables experts to tamper with their broadband connection and optimize the connection speed Save to Pocket: Save your favorite content while browsing online by adding it to a virtual pocket with this reliable extension that lets you configure some of its parameters Gideros: Create new applications in an easy-to-understand programming environment using HTML and javascript with this comprehensive application Reader comments The Document Foundation: Munich Returning to Windows and Office a Step Backwards more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Google Allo gets improved GIF and emoji support, easier access to Google Assistant Posted Mar 2, 2017 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Amazon begins large-scale rooftop solar installation across its warehouses Allo, the messaging app Google launched into a crowded market last September, is getting an update today. The update focuses on improved support for emoji and GIFs (because that is, after all, what the world needs), and easier access to the Google Assistant. As far as we can tell, Allo has been anything but a hit for Google. With Hangouts, the company had a perfectly solid and competitive cross-platform messaging app in the market. Instead of trying to build on that, though, it launched Allo for messaging and Duo for one-on-one video chats. Hangouts was supposed to become the more business-centric chat app and Allo and Duo were supposed to become its consumer counterparts. All Google achieved with this strategy so far is confusion and very little traction in the marketplace for either Allo or Duo. And to muddy the waters even more, Google also quietly launched Meet by Google Hangouts — an extra-enterprise friendly version of Hangout — earlier this week and then quickly pulled the app from the Google Play store after we wrote about it. Today’s update isn’t likely to make a difference in Allo’s popularity. If you do use it, though, it’ll now be easier to add GIFs to your conversations. You only have to tap the smiley icon in the chat bar and then swipe left to bring up the GIF search. Easy enough. Allo is also getting new animated emoji. Simply select one, touch and hold the send button, and then drag up or down to make them larger or smaller. Probably the most useful new feature is faster access to the Google Assistant in Allo. The compose box now features a button that lets you add the Assistant to any conversation with just a tap. Google says one out of twelve messages in group chats in Allo are to the Google Assistant already. All of these new features are starting to roll out on Android today and will also come to iOS “soon” (though it’s unclear how soon “soon” is). 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Jay Z Has Arrived | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes messaging messaging apps Google Allo Google Apps Popular Posts Featured Stories Jay Z Has Arrived | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:21 | Crunch Report Amazon’s AWS buys Thinkbox Software, maker of tools for creative professionals 11 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden Should Snap buy Twitter? 12 hours ago | Alex Wilhelm, Jonathan Shieber Justin Kan launches his own startup incubator program called Zero-F 12 hours ago | Jon Russell Snap tumbles 12% on day three, erases gains 13 hours ago | Katie Roof Latest From Mobile Old-school social networks Tagged and Hi5 bought by MeetMe for $60M 10 hours ago | Josh Constine Will the Galaxy S8 let Samsung put the Note 7 behind it for good? 14 hours ago | Brian Heater Lightroom Mobile gains RAW HDR capture on iOS and Android 16 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Trying out Prisma’s new photo filter store yesterday | Anthony Ha Comment moderation powered by Up Next Amazon begins large-scale rooftop solar installation across its warehouses Posted Mar 2, 2017 CrunchBoard Job Listings Mobile User Experience Designer (UX) - TrainingPeaks at Peaksware (Boulder, CO, United States) Director of Community & Business Development (YC-backed) at Paragon One (New York, NY, United States) Lead Web Developer @ Numerai at Numerai (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer- Fullstack/Backend @ Sift Science at Sift Science (San Francisco, CA, United States) SysAdmin DevOps at Peaksware (Boulder, CO, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Apple is losing ground in its traditional market: Education Analysts peer into Microsoft's rumored Windows 10 Cloud Microsoft’s OS supremacy over Apple to end in 2017 Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Apple last year again lost ground in the U.S. K-12 market, as Google with its Chrome OS continued to make gains, a research firm said Thursday. In 2016, 58% of the 12.6 million mobile computers shipped to educational customers -- or approximately 7.3 million -- were powered by Chrome OS, up from 50% of 2015's 10.7 million (or 5.35 million), U.K.-based Futuresource Consulting said in a report yesterday. Meanwhile, Apple's OS X/macOS and iOS operating systems -- which power Macs and iPads, respectively -- fell from a combined 25% share in 2015 (or 2.7 million devices) to 19% in 2016 (or 2.4 million). Futuresource counted laptops, tablets, Chromebooks and the aged category dubbed "netbooks," but omitted desktop computers in its tallies. The downturn in Apple's K-12 fate last year was the second consecutive decline, according to Futuresource: In 2014, OS X + iOS accounted for 34% of educational mobile computer shipments in the U.S. That year, Chrome OS's share was 38%. While Apple's share was falling and Google's was climbing, Microsoft's remained stable, said Futuresource: Windows powered 25% of the shipped computers in 2014, dipped to 22% the next year and held steady at the same share in 2016. Apple's educational reputation harks back nearly 40 years, with roots in the Apple IIe that became the de facto educational computer in the K-12 world. But the higher prices of the Mac successor, and continued premium cost of the company's iPad from 2010 on, allowed first the Windows PC and then later, Chromebooks, to curry favor because of their lower acquisition costs. Futuresource cited Chromebooks' affordability and manageability as selling points, but not surprisingly in an environment where school district dollars are ever more precious, stressed the former above all else. "The rise of Chromebooks has also set new industry benchmarks with regards to average device pricing, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects," the research firm said. Microsoft has announced initiatives to better compete with Chrome OS -- an attempt to move Windows' share from its mid-20s mark -- such as January's trumpeting of Windows 10 devices as low as $189, and Intune for Education, cloud-based device management priced at $30 per machine, the same Google charges for its Chrome OS management suite. The Redmond, Wash. company is also reportedly working on a new edition of Windows 10, tagged as "Windows 10 Cloud," to power Chromebook competitors. Even so, Microsoft "continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare" in the educational space, said Mike Fisher, an analyst at Futuresource, in a Thursday statement. Futuresource Consulting Apple's share of the U.S. K-12 educational market has slipped two years running, while Chrome OS's has climbed to claim the largest chunk by far.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Maps adds Skull Island to help promote new King Kong movie Newsby John Callaham3 days ago 13 683 15 Skull Island might be a fictional location, but for a little while at least you can check it out on Google Maps. The company is partnering with Legendary and Universal Pictures to show where the dangerous tropical location exists as part of a promotion for the upcoming giant monster movie Kong: Skull Island. See also: Google Maps adds Uber integration and a new UI for ride options January 12, 2017 The Google Maps listing shows Skull Island as an “archaeological site” near the equator and several thousand miles west of the coast of Peru. In a statement, Google said that people can post their own photos and “fantasy reviews” of Skull Island, and so far over 6,000 people have done just that, which is pretty impressive for a fictional piece of land. If Skull Island were a real place, it would likely be deadly to most humans. The movie shows an expedition heading to check out the island sometime in the early 1970s but are quickly attacked by the massive King Kong, along with lots of other giant monsters. The movie Kong: Skull Island will hit theaters on March 10. It’s also the second in a projected series of “Monsterverse” movies that began in 2014 with the release of the latest US version of Godzilla. The third movie in the series, Godzilla: King of Monsters, will be released in March 2019, and the final film in the series, Godzilla vs. Kong, is set to hit theaters in 2020.

By JenniferBooton Reporter It isn’t his three-month-old child that keeps Sir Martin Sorrell up all night. For the chief executive officer of the world’s largest ad agency, Amazon.com Inc. is a nightmare. “In answer to the question, my favorite question, ‘What worries you when you go to bed at night and wake up in the morning?’ it isn’t a 3-month-old child,” Sorrell, a 74-year-old new father and WPP, +1.69%  EO, said Friday. “It’s Amazon, which is a child still, but not three months.” Amazon AMZN, -0.38%   is pressuring Google’s GOOGL, -0.21% GOOG, -0.16%   search business, and its penetration in advertising is “frightening if not terrifying to some,” Sorrell said. He thinks there’s “a battle brewing” between Google and Amazon. The comments were given on a conference call Friday morning after the U.K.-based ad agency reported an 18% increase in revenue for the quarter, but projected a slowdown in 2017. In London trading, shares of WPP closed down nearly 8% Friday. The digital advertising market is currently dominated by Facebook Inc. FB, +0.18%  and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, two companies that shared a whopping 58% of the $72 billion U.S. digital ads market in 2016, according to eMarketer. Amazon controlled just 1.3% of the market, but has a unique position as an e-commerce giant in which it plays liaison between brand and end user. Ad agencies have long served as the middleman between the two. While there other major players in the digital advertising space that are bigger than Amazon, including Verizon Communications VZ, -0.12% which owns AOL and is soon expected to close on a deal to buy Yahoo Inc. YHOO, -0.59%  , Amazon is particularly alarming because of the troves of data on consumer shopping behavior it has amassed over the years. In addition to its shopping portal, Amazon has unique features, such as its Alexa-powered smart home hub and Dash buy buttons people can stick around their homes, that can give brands direct insight into the way people shop. Amazon’s AI engine and the associated hardware might also provide a direct advertising portal for brands to reach potential consumers directly. What can artificial intelligence do for retail?(2:34) Customers return about 23% of their purchases both in-store and online, costing retailers $643 billion per year. Can artificial intelligence eliminate returns through virtual 3D try-on? Earlier this week on CNBC, Sorrell said Amazon and Snapchat parent Snap Inc. SNAP, -12.26%  were emerging threats to Facebook and Google in the digital advertising space. But he said Amazon, specifically, threatened Google with its search bar that consumers have been increasingly using over Google to search for products. Also Read: Nobody thinks Snap stock is worth the price Adam Smith, who serves as futures director of GroupM, the parent company of WPP, said the company has recently opened an ad agency in Seattle, where Amazon is based, to “deal with Amazon and cater to Amazon” as the company’s gains for advertising steam. WPP views digital media companies such as Google and Facebook as “frenemies.” It must work with them to meet its clients’ digital ad needs, but also continues to lose traditional advertising share to lower-margin digital advertising, which is weighing on its business. Shares of Amazon closed flat around $849.40 on Friday. They’ve gained nearly 15% in the past three months and 47% in the past year, vastly outperforming the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.33%  , which is up 9% and 19.5% in those time periods. Google’s shares have performed more in line with the larger market, increasing 11% in the past three months and 16% in the past year.

Find out how to get, activate and start using the new digital assistant, here.   Almost a year after it was first unveiled, Google has finally begun a widespread rollout of its own AI-powered virtual assistant. Following it the footsteps of popular virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa and Cortana, Google Assistant brings a digital helper of its own to Android users across the globe.   The feature, which was first showcased at Google I/O last spring, was initially made available only to Google Pixel phone users, but as of this week, Google announced that many more Android users will be enjoying Google Assistant. The feature began rolling out to Nougat and Marshmallow devices the week of February 26 and continues to become available to more users every day. If you have an Android device and want to get Google Assistant working on it but aren’t sure how, we’ve put together a comprehensive guide of everything you need to know to activate and begin using Google Assistant on your device. Google Assistant Update Release: How To Get, Activate And Start Using Google’s New Virtual Assistant Google's virtual assistant has begun rolling out to more users this week. Find out if your device is compatible. Photo: Google Which Devices Are Compatible With Google Assistant? So before you try to grab Google Assistant, the first thing you need to check is if your device is compatible. Google Assistant has been available on Google Pixel Phone since its release, but this week, Google has begun rolling out the AI helper to Android phones running Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow. While there is no official listing of phones that will be compatible with the update, here are a few popular devices that should receive it: HTC 10 HTC U Ultra Huawei P9 LG G5 LG V20 Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Sony Xperia XZ Which Countries Will Receive The Google Assistant Update? Unfortunately, Google Assistant won’t be available to users in every country. The update will release to users in the U.S. first and then will roll out to users in the UK, Australia, Canada and Germany. Android users outside of these countries will not have access to the update.  How Do I Get And Activate Google Assistant? If you know your device is compatible then getting the Google Assistant is pretty simple. All that is required is to update your device’s Google Play Services. Keep in mind, though, Google Assistant is rolling out slowly, so not everyone with a compaatible device in a country where the rollout is taking place will have access to it right away. If your Google Play Service is updated but Google Assistant still isn't available to you, it likely hasn't rolled out in your area yet. Just keep checking on it each day. How Do I Update Google Play Services? Updating Google Play Services is fairly simple but not exactly intuitive. Here are steps to follow for getting and updating Google Play Services on your Android phone. Get the latest Google Play Services APK and download it on your device. You can find a full listing of these, here. Find the APK your downloaded, and copy it to your device’s internal/external storage. Go to Settings > Security > Unknown Sources and check the box that allows 3rd-party application installation. Now find where you saved the APK on your device and open up the installation screen. Tap on the install button and the update will begin. Once the app is finished updating, Google Assistant should be ready to go! How To Check If Google Assistant Is Installed Activating Google Assistant simply requires long pressing the home button or saying "Ok, Google." Photo: Google If Google Assistant has rolled out in our area, and Google Play Services have updated properly, Google Assistant should be ready to go. To activate Google assistant and start using it, simply long press on the home button. You’ll be introduced to Google Assistant and asked to allow some permissions so that it can work. Once you’ve finished, Google Assistant is ready to use.  Tips And Tricks For Starting And Using Google Assistant You can ask Google Assistant to help with lots of things. The new virtual AI is designed to understand natural language. Photo: Google Once you know Google Assistant is installed, you are now ready to start using it. To activate Google Assistant either long press on the home button or say the magic words, “Ok, Google.” Google Assistant will pop up on the screen with a “Hi, how can I help you” message. If you are new to using a virtual assistant, you might feel a little silly talking to it. Don’t worry, though: New AI helpers like Google Assistant have been designed to recognize natural language, so just ask questions the way you would to a friend. On the Google Assistant’s support page, the company actually offers a few suggestions for things you can ask your new smartphone helper. Here’s a small sample: What's the weather today? What's will the weather be this weekend? What restaurants are nearby? I feel like having pizza tonight. Where's the closest gas station? Which pharmacy is open? How long will it take to get to the airport? Show me my schedule for tomorrow. Set an alarm for 6 a.m. Show me my photos of the beach. What's "How are you?" in German Show me the trailer for the latest Pixar movie. Are you using Google Assistant? What do you think of the new AI helper? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Rick Osterloh, head of the hardware department at Google, spoke to AndroidPit about the future of Pixel devices. He noted that there are currently too few Pixel devices to meet consumer demand. Osterloh also confirmed that the Pixel will remain a premium device and a cheaper version won't be released. "Pixel stays premium," he said. Google is planning to follow the typical yearly smartphone release schedule similar to other manufacturers. Osterloh said, "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it." He then followed up by saying, "You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now." With both Apple and Samsung planning some impressive updates this year, it will be interesting to see what Google has in store for its next generation Pixel.

(Photo by Fox Photos/Getty Images) Amazon, Connectivity, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Here are the Submarine Cables Funded by Cloud Giants by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on March 3, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet As their global bandwidth needs grow, operators of hyper-scale cloud platforms — Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon — have started to play a much bigger role in consortia that build intercontinental submarine cables. In some cases, these cloud companies have been signing on as major customers of future cables, thereby enabling cable builders to finance the projects. In other cases — and we’re seeing more and more of this lately — these companies get involved directly, as the projects’ investors and owners. Recent examples of the latter include Facebook and Google’s investment in construction of the Pacific Light Cable Network, which will link Los Angeles to Hong Kong, and Facebook and Microsoft’s investment in the MAREA cable, which will connect a landing station on the coast of Virginia to a landing station in Bilbao, Spain. These investments by hyper-scale companies and by other cable builders looking to serve their bandwidth needs have spurred a submarine cable construction boom. One of the potential outcomes of the boom is more demand for data center space in facilities operated by the likes of Equinix or Digital Realty Trust, among others, which can provide network access to these new connectivity routes. More on that here: Will the Submarine Cable Boom Drive More Revenue to Colos? And here’s the list of submarine cable construction projects hyper-scale cloud companies have helped fund in recent years.

FAQ: How to get Google Assistant on your Android phone Google Assistant is officially available for many Android phones now, but the rollout will take time. Danny Sullivan on March 6, 2017 at 2:07 pm More Excited to get Google Assistant on your Android phone? Until last week, it was only available for Google Pixel phones. Now, it’s rolling out slowly to Android phones beyond that. Here’s how it may come to your phone or why it might not be on it already. Google Assistant is Google’s new digital assistant to take on the likes of Siri. It allows you to easily speak what you want and get back answers. It’ll even have a conversation with you and complete some actions like movie ticket bookings, when all goes well. When it doesn’t go well, you might prefer to do a regular Google search. Until last week, the only smartphones with Google Assistant were Google’s own Pixels. However, the company announced that smartphones running Android 6 or Android 7 would get Google Assistant, with the release of Google Assistant beginning last Thursday. Here’s the rundown on how Google Assistant will come to your Android phone, if eligible. You can’t download it as an app Google Assistant isn’t an app that you can download. It’s part of the Android operating system, much as Siri is part of iOS. If Google decides your phone can handle Google Assistant, you’ll get that as part of an Android OS update. If not, you can always try Google Assistant by using Google’s Allo app. You need to meet these requirements Phones also have to have 1.5GB of memory or higher and 720p or higher screen resolution. It’s only offered to those with phones set to use English in the US, Australia, Canada and the UK. German speakers in Germany will also get it. More countries and language support are promised later this year. Phones also have to support Google Play Services. Basically, if you get your apps on your phone using the Google Play app store, you’ve got Google Play Services. You need Android 6.1.3 – maybe Last week, Google specifically told Search Engine Land that phones need to be updated to Android 6.1.3 to get Google Assistant. If you’re on Android 6 below that release, you won’t get it. Today, Google clarified that to mean that you need to have the 6.13 version of the Google app, not the 6.1.3. version of Android, to get the Google Assistant. Unfortunately, I can see one Android 6 phone that has the 6.14 version of the Google search app still doesn’t have Google Assistant. So, it’s pretty confusing. Android 7.0 may not be enough If you have Android 7.0, that alone isn’t enough for you to have Google Assistant. For example, my Galaxy S7 Edge was upgraded to Android 7.0 today. Google Assistant did not come with it. My Google Pixel phone is on Android 7.1.1, but I know someone with a Nexus 5X on that same version of Android 7.1.1 without Google Assistant. So unlike with Android 6, Google Assistant with Android 7 doesn’t seem tied to a particular version. Google told Search Engine Land today that there’s no particular version of Android 7 needed. It just might take weeks until these Android 7 devices get it. Upgrading Google Play Services may not work I’ve seen advice in various places purporting that people can download the latest version of Google Play Services and “sideload” that onto their phone to get Google Assistant. However, I have multiple phones with the most current version being recommended for download that do not have Google Assistant. I suspect this isn’t actually a solution. How long will it take to get? Google told Search Engine Land that the rollout might take weeks to come to all the eligible smartphones out there. How will I know if I have it? To know if you have Google Assistant, hold down on your home button or icon. You should get this screen: It will say, “Hi, how can I help.” If you don’t get that screen, you don’t have Google Assistant.

If you want to read how both Facebook and Google AdWords (paid search) can benefit your paid media strategy by targeting the full funnel, check out my most recent blog on “How to Leverage Paid Media for the Entire Customer’s Journey.” So why is there so much discussion around Facebook Advertising and Google AdWords in the paid media space? Simply put, the continual growth year after year cannot be ignored. According to Forbes, Facebook saw a 50% increase in active advertisers from 2015-2016 and reached 3 million advertisers. In addition, Facebook accounts for 65% of total social network ad spend expected to reach $36 billion this year. Why such a significant growth? This is primarily due to the platform’s targeting capabilities, the growth of mobile, and the growth of engaged users. Not to be entirely outdone, Google saw a 17% increase in revenues year over year, comparing 2014 to 2015 according to AdAge. Growth in revenues for AdWords are primarily attributed to the growth of mobile, shopping, and other ad formats. So, when you must select one advertising channel over the other, which one should you choose? As a side note for this article, when I talk about Google AdWords I’ll be speaking primarily to their search product (so please keep this in mind). There are several factors to consider when deciding which advertising channel is best for your organization. Digital Advertising Budget & Average CPC In most cases, the cost per click (CPC) will be significantly higher for Google AdWords than Facebook ads. Per AdEspresso, the average CPC for Facebook Ads in the US was $0.28 in Q3 of 2016. Conversely, Google AdWords search average CPC was $2.32 according to WordStream. Therefore, on average, Facebook ads were approximately 88% cheaper than AdWords in 2016. So if you have a very small monthly advertising budget (say $500-$1,000), it would be advantageous to run Facebook ads as it will allow you to “get more bang for your buck.” Granted, clicks are not everything and there are rare occurrences where you can make AdWords work with smaller budgets. However, sometimes advertisers simply do not have large enough budgets to compete on AdWords and they could see much better results (both clicks and conversions) on more affordable channels, like Facebook. Your Industry & Your Competition A related point to the first is you should consider the industry of your business and your competition when trying to make the decision. There are certain industries or sub-industries that are crazy expensive from a CPC perspective. For example, if you are considering advertising any of these keywords on Google, and you do not have an insanely large budget, you might want to reconsider. I have firsthand experience working in higher education, finance, legal, and healthcare; all are extremely competitive within AdWords and therefore very difficult to be successful in. Again, I am not advocating not using AdWords, but setting the expectation that Facebook ads might be a more affordable alternative with extremely powerful targeting capabilities for many industries. Defining Your Objective Once you’ve determined what your organization can afford and you’ve considered the industry and the competition, you then should consider what you’re hoping to achieve from this marketing initiative. If your goal is increasing brand awareness or demand generation, Facebook ads would be your best bet. However, if you’re looking to generate sales or leads (i.e. demand capture), then AdWords might be a better bet. With AdWords, a user is searching for what your organization is selling. Therefore, their intent to purchase is generally much higher. But you’ll need to once again consider overall costs. In several cases, we have seen lower cost-per-conversions (i.e. cost per leads) from Facebook ads. Stage in Buyer’s Journey Understanding where the user is in the buyer’s journey will also help you decide which advertising channel to leverage. If you are looking to capture users in the moment of looking to purchase a product or service, Google AdWords would be your best bet due to the high level of intent from your audience. However, if you’re trying to bring more awareness or consideration to your offering, then Facebook ads can help you target those with a current or unknown need for your product or service. This is how both channels can complement and fuel the growth of your organization. Product/Service Maturity & Overall Search Volume This point is obvious and somewhat overlooked. If your organization has a new product or service and there is very little or no search volume, then Google AdWords (paid search) most likely will not generate a ton of traffic and therefore is unlikely to perform. Before you rule out AdWords completely in this scenario, you may consider bidding on a series of keywords which describes a problem that your product or service solves. My recommendation would be testing out bidding on what your product or service solves rather than a product or service that very few have been exposed to. For instance, Tile, which is described as a “Bluetooth tracker,” was one of the first of its kind. Keywords such as “find your wallet,” “find your keys,” and “find your phone” could have generated significantly more search than “Bluetooth tracker” or even their own brand name. In most cases, however, I would recommend starting out on Facebook ads to generate awareness of your products or services, explain what problem they solve, and develop brand recognition. Then, you’ll generate demand to set you up for more success when it comes to Google AdWords. Demographic-sensitive Product or Service Simply put, there may be certain instances when one advertising platform is a better fit than the other. If the purchase of your product or service strongly correlates based on specific life events, then Facebook is most likely your best option. Facebook has powerful targeting capabilities such as being able to target based on life-changing events. For instance, targeting those who have become recently engaged or married, those turning 65 (Medicare insurance), or those who recently had a new baby are examples of life events that can all be targeted with precision via Facebook ads and not as easily or effective through AdWords. On the other hand, a product or service offering that appeals to larger audiences might be better advertised on AdWords. Brand Recognition Not nearly as important as some other factors, but worth noting and loosely related to the point above. If you are a new company, you are most likely going to be less successful in search compared to a mature, established company in your industry. Why? In this scenario, your competitors have much more brand recognition and brand loyalists. When users see your ad (a company which they do not recognize) and your competitor’s ad (one they do recognize), they will most likely see much more success (i.e. higher click-through rate) in your competitor’s ad. Larry Kim at WordStream wrote a great article on this concept of brand affinity as it relates to search with great insights backed by data. Therefore, make sure you consider your company’s position in the marketplace. You may simply need to build up your brand reputation through Facebook ads and other channels to start, before moving into AdWords to increase your chances of success. A Bonus Chart to Guide You Below is a quick chart to help guide you in making the best decision for your organization between Google AdWords and Facebook Ads. Although there are exceptions to the rule, if your situation steers more to one side or the other, that is the channel you should test first. Conclusion After reading through these points, you will notice that there is not a one-size-fits-all answer to whether you should use AdWords vs. Facebook. When trying to decide between Facebook Ads and Google AdWords for your organization, you need to first take a step back and understand what you are looking to achieve from your investment and your available marketing budget. These are really the two most important factors when considering which channel is best. The other factors are also important and should help support your decision on what is best for your company or brand. Image Credits Featured Image: Created by author Screenshots by Joe Castro.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google has this week opened up beta testing programs for its Gboard keyboard application and for Google Play Services. Gboard is an advanced keyboard that includes emoji and GIF search tools. Google Play Services is the core behind the Google Play Store and is what allows developers to create apps for multiple versions of the operating system. Google warns that beta variants of Gboard and Play Services may be unstable when compared to the public releases. Google hopes beta testers will offer feedback about their experiences in order to help improve the apps ahead of general release. Google already offers beta testing programs for the Google Search app and Chrome browser. more info at Gboard » more info at Google Play Services » Related Google news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google says a new version of its Google Photos app introduces several new editing tools for improving photographs. The Google Photos editor already automatically corrects exposure and saturation, but will now also automatically correct white balance. It can sense whether photos are too yellow or too blue and balance them out. Further, the editor makes it possible to manually control white balance with a slider tool. Google says this feature is rolling out to Google Photos on the web and for Android devices this week, with iOS to follow later. more info at Google » Related Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

We’ve seen a handful of users getting the changes on their devices, and now it looks like the updated user interface is heading to everyone. It’s worth noting that this interface refresh is a server-side update, and not from a brand new version of the Google Play Store, which basically means that there is very little that users can do to force the Google Play Store to switch over to the new UI. This updated UI makes things a bit simpler. So now there are a few more tabs in the “My Apps & Games” section. There are Updates, Installed, Library, Beta and Family Library. All of which are pretty much self-explanatory, Updates is definitely the most interesting one. This shows you what updates are waiting for you, when the apps got this update, as well as how large the update is. You can choose to update individual apps, or all of them with the “Update All” button at the top. Of course “Installed” shows all of the apps installed on your smartphone right now, “Library” shows everything you’ve ever downloaded. While the “Beta” tab shows all of the beta apps you currently have installed and finally “Family Library” shows the apps that are part of your Family Library. A feature that Google rolled out fairly recently. There are also changes to the visual elements in this change to the “My Apps & Games” section of the Play Store. The layout isn’t as spacious as it used to be. You essentially have one “card” which shows all of the data for all of the apps. This means that users are able to see more data on their device’s display without the need of scrolling down, which is always appreciated. This does mean slightly smaller touch targets, but on a smartphone, that isn’t a terrible thing (that really only matters when you are using your phone in the car while driving, like on Android Auto). This layout does appear to be heading to everyone right now, but it’s unclear how quickly it’ll hit everyone’s device. It’s a staged rollout, so it’ll likely take a bit of time, possibly even a few weeks.

The head of hardware at Google has confirmed that the firm is developing a second-generation Pixel for the ‘premium smartphone market’.  It is believed that the 'Pixel 2' could launch this fall, which would put the handset in direct competition with Apple's iPhone 8. Scroll down for video  The head of hardware at Google has confirmed that the firm is developing a second-generation Pixel (pictured is first-generation Pixel handsets)  for the ‘premium smartphone market’. It is believed that the 'Pixel 2' could launch this fall The confirmation comes from Rick Osterloh during an interview with AndroidPT. ‘There is an annual rhythm in the industry,’ Osterloh said in the interview. ‘So, you can count on us to follow it’ ‘You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now."

Share this article Share 32 shares Google debuted the first smartphones in its Pixel line during a conference in October 2016, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Both phones are available in 32 GB ($649 for the Pixel, $769 for the XL) and 128 GB ($749 for the Pixel, $869 for the XL) – prices that surpass Apple’s iPhone line. Although the Pixel 2 release would fall around the same time as the iPhone 8, Google is focusing on the upper price segment of the market. The confirmation comes from Rick Osterloh during an interview with AndroidPT. Google’s second-generation phone (pictured is the original Pixel) would go head-to-head with Apple’s launch of its rumored iPhone 7s and highly-anticipated iPhone 8 Osterloh stated that ‘Pixel stays premium’ and the firm will ‘leave lower price segments to other manufacturers’. The firm launched the Pixel line around the same time as the iPhone 7 was revealed. 'We believe the next big thing will be at the intersection of hardware and software,’ Osterloh said in October. And he also took aim at Apple, saying the phone has 'no unsightly phone bump'. Brian Rakowski of Google said the phone was 'designed inside and out to be smart'. He said the Pixel's new camera was better than the iPhone 7. 'It's the best smartphone camera anyone has made,' he said. GOOGLE PIXEL SPECS  The Pixel runs on a Snapdragon 821 2.15GHz processor. The handsets come in 32GB or 128GB models, with microSD card slots enabling an additional 256GB of storage. The first-generation Pixel is be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip They have 12.3 and 8-megapixel cameras and a full HD AMOLED screen with Gorilla Glass protection. Fast charging gives 7 hours of use in 15 minutes Included is Google's AI assistant, Allo for messaging and Duo for video calls. Free online storage for pictures and video Is be available in US on Verizon and in an unlocked version from $649.  The first-generation handset range includes two new phones, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL If a fall release date is in order, Google’s second-generation phone would go head-to-head with Apple’s launch of its rumored iPhone 7s and highly-anticipated iPhone 8 – which could give Google some competition. Apple’s upcoming flagship is said to be packed with cutting-edge technology and have a sleek design. The rumors, which have been surfacing since last year, suggest that the handset will have an OLED wraparound screen, biometric technology and even wireless charging. And although Google has its sights set on the premium market – the iPhone has been speculated to cost $1,000.   Read more: Pixel boss Rick Osterloh: Pixel 2 is coming this year and staying premium - AndroidPIT Share or comment on this article e-mail 32 shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you The Manly ferry tackles huge swells over the weekend Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

Google today announced that it’s adding an auto white balance feature to Google Photos. As the name implies, the feature will automatically correct the white balance of the photo that you select. Google Photos can also correct your exposure and saturation. If you’d like, you can go into Color and further tweak the Warmth and Tint yourself. The new auto white balance feature will roll out to Google Photos on Android and the web this week. iOS users will get it “soon.” Many photo editing tools offer the ability to tweak your white balance, but not everyone has the time or skill to manually edit their images. This Google Photos update aims to make photo editing easier for those people by adding white balance to the ways that it can automatically improve users’ images.

Phones by Gordon Gottsegen March 2, 2017 1:32 PM PST @ggottsegen Google Assistant rolling out to Android devices now Users of Android 6.0 and higher will find a new feature on their phones with an update that brings along Google's virtual assistant. by Iyaz Akhtar 1:05 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Check your phone: Today, Google Assistant is available to more devices running Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The rollout was announced last week, but Google just released a video ad (see it above), signaling that today's the day more people can start using Google's helper. Unfortunately, Google doesn't say which devices will get the Assistant. If you're lucky, you may already have an update for Google Play Services which contains the new feature. Enlarge Image Google Assistant on the Samsung Galaxy S7, LG V20 and HTC 10. Google Google announced the Google Assistant during its hardware event in October 2016. Google Assistant is a beefed-up smart AI assistant that differs from Google's previous assistant Google Now, and offers a more personal and conversational tone than its predecessor. It can make lists, book reservations and answer follow-up questions, something that Apple's Siri struggles with. At first, Google Assistant was exclusive to the Google Pixel and Pixel XL and advertised as a major selling point for the phone during the event. Google initially had no plans of sharing Google Assistant with other phones, but after months of exclusivity the assistant is coming to other Androids. Don't worry if you don't see the update yet: The feature will first roll out to English users in the US, then Australia, Canada and the UK, then German speakers in Germany, as stated in Google's earlier press release. The company also said in the release that Google Assistant will be available on Samsung, Sony, HTC and Huawei devices, showing renders of Google Assistant on the Samsung Galaxy S7, LG V20 and HTC 10 (hint, hint). Google also showcased the assistant on some of these devices at Mobile World Congress.

The Mountain View City Council will discuss Tuesday whether it will grant Google permits to create its Charleston East campus that will be open to its employees and the public. Google envisions having a canopied 595,000 square foot two-story office building on the 18.6 acre property. The structure would be unlike any office building in the Silicon Valley, made up of “separate roof panels, held up by a grid of poles,” according to a city report released on Friday. “Vertical glass curtain walls would enclose the structure on all four sides, further allowing the inside to be illuminated by natural light,” the report said. Google employees would use offices on the first and second stories of the building. Members of the public would be able to walk through a pathway from dawn to dusk on the first floor, with retail and cafes nearby, the city report said. Renderings from Google included in the report show members of the community doing Tai-chi and a green loop for bicyclists and pedestrians. In the southeast part of the Charleston East campus, near Shoreline Boulevard and Charleston Road, Google plans on having a two-acre public plaza for food trucks and events like performances and outdoor markets, the report said. “Google’s presence in Mountain View is simply so strong that it can’t be a fortress that shuts away nature, that shuts away its neighbors,” said architect Bjarke Ingels, whose firm is a consultant on Google’s campus project, in a video about the space. “It really needs to become a neighborhood in Mountain View.” But as part of its new campus plans, Google plans to remove 196 heritage trees, which requires city approval. Google says it will plant 392 trees, including oak, willow and buckeye trees, to replace the ones that will be removed. The shift in trees will cause a reduction in tree canopy coverage. Currently, there is about 12 percent tree canopy coverage and that will drop to 3 percent at “the time of planting,” the report said. But 15 years later, the tree canopy coverage is expected to grow to 30 percent, the report said. The new project will generate roughly $3 million in additional property tax revenue for the shoreline community, the report said. The project will also pay the city $14.9 million in a housing impact fee and $17.9 million that will go to transportation improvements in North Bayshore, the report said. Google will also pay $250,000 to the city related to its North Bayshore Precise Plan and environmental impact report. Google says Charleston East will have 1,200 parking spaces. On Tuesday, the council will also discuss whether to extend Google’s lease on parking spaces at the Shoreline Amphitheatre to serve as temporary spaces while the project is being developed. Google and Live Nation are seeking to extend a lease on parking spaces at the Shoreline Amphitheatre from Dec. 13, 2017 to the end of 2020. If the city council approves this, Google says it will pay the City of Mountain View a one-time sum of $600,000 and annual rent of $2.25 million for renting the two parking lots. If Google is granted occupancy on its new Charleston East campus before the end of 2020, the $600,000 payment would go toward the rent on the parking lots. In addition, Google says it will restrict parking for Charleston East on its property at 2171 Landings Drive and other Google property near Charleston East campus.

This means that, alongside the ability to see whether a business accepts credit cards, serves alcohol, and is accessible to wheelchairs Google Maps Is Now Wheelchair Friendly Google Maps Is Now Wheelchair Friendly Google has added information regarding wheelchair accessibility to Google Maps. And it's all thanks to the company's famed "20% time". Read More , users will now be able to see whether a business offers gender-neutral bathrooms. Thanks to this additional information, Yelp users will, at a glance, be able to see whether a business offers gender-neutral bathrooms. This information, which will be listed alongside a range of other attributes, will be available on both the desktop and mobile versions of Yelp. Yelp Defines Gender-Neutral Bathrooms Yelp is also adding the option to search for businesses which offer gender-neutral bathrooms. This will help people who exclusively use gender-neutral bathrooms, or those who strongly support their use, to know what to expect ahead of actually visiting the business in question. Yelp regards a restroom as being gender-neutral if it’s a “locking, single-stall bathroom accessible to persons of any gender”. This reflects the fact that more businesses are ripping out their designated male and female restrooms in favor of stalls available to all genders. Yelp will collect this information in two ways. Business owners can simply log into their user account and edit the “Gender Neutral Restrooms” attribute. Meanwhile, users who check into or review businesses will be asked, “Does this business have Gender Neutral Restrooms?” Businesses Seek to Become More Inclusive With businesses seeking to become more inclusive, Yelp Investigating The Yelp Rating Algorithm: How Internet Memes Spread Investigating The Yelp Rating Algorithm: How Internet Memes Spread Many small businesses on Yelp believe the review service manipulates its rating algorithm. But is it true? We detail that investigation with first person accounts and interviews with Yelp managers. Read More is simply reflecting a societal change. Adding the option to see whether a business offers gender-neutral bathrooms is a simple way of helping those for whom this is an important issue. And everyone else can just carry on as usual. Do you view the attributes of businesses on Yelp before visiting? Which attributes have you actively searched for? Is the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms important to you?

Google’s location tracking is better now than ever before Columnist Andy Taylor notes that Google has improved its ability to track search traffic at the ZIP code level, which is good news for advertisers who employ granular geographic targeting. Andy Taylor on March 2, 2017 at 10:47 am More In April 2015, I wrote about Google’s progress in steadily tracking more and more user locations to ZIP codes. As ZIP codes are the most granular location type which populates the “Most specific location” field in AdWords geographic reports, the share of traffic that Google assigns to ZIP codes in this field gives advertisers an idea of how well Google is doing at figuring out searcher locations. At the time, Google was showing strong progress in its location tracking: Fast forward to today, and Google is tracking more searchers to ZIP codes than ever before. However, most of the progress made only applies to google.com traffic, while search partners are continuing to lag in terms of the share of searchers tracked to a ZIP code. One big, huge, ginormous caveat The most important thing to keep in mind with this analysis is that it is based on the locations that Google itself reports. This means that if Google were to, say, expand the use of modeling to infer searcher location to apply to users whose locations it is less confident in, we might see a rise in the share of traffic tracked to a ZIP code without any change in what information Google is actually getting. As such, the trends shown here could be the result of updates Google itself made in assigning and reporting searcher location, rather than Google actually obtaining more granular information on searcher location over time. They could also be the result of a combination of Google changes and more granular information. Google better able to track google.com searcher locations across all device types Across the board, Merkle advertisers are finding more and more traffic attributed to ZIP codes in the “Most specific location” field in AdWords geographic reports. Looking at google.com traffic specifically for one advertiser, we find that while 28 percent of all traffic in Q1 2015 could not be tracked to the ZIP code level in this field, that figure was just 11 percent in Q4 2016. The share of traffic tracked to ZIP code has risen for all device types over the last couple of years: Google continues to track more searchers to the ZIP code level on desktop and tablet computers than on phones, but the gap is now much smaller than it was two years ago. Location tracking users on search partners lagging but getting better Search partner location tracking is also getting better, but no device type topped 80 percent in share tracked to the ZIP code level in Q4 2016. As with google.com searchers, phone searchers are less likely to be tracked to a ZIP code. As such, it’s apparent that Google isn’t always receiving the same information from search partner sites as it gathers when searchers are on Google’s website. It could be that there are specific sites which have issues, or it could be that this is just a complication Google has with all of its search partners. Either way, Google’s progress in tracking search partner user locations at the ZIP code level is rather muted when compared to the significant leaps it has made in tracking searcher locations on its own site. Google average household income targets becoming more powerful Google average household income (HHI) targeting has existed for several years now, and it allows advertisers to target ads and adjust bids based on the average income of the ZIP code a user is searching from using income percentile bundles. In this way, advertisers can target, for example, all of the US searchers which Google can identify as searching from ZIP codes in the top 10 percent in average household income without having to add all of those ZIP codes individually. Since these targets are based on ZIP code location, only those searchers tracked to the ZIP code level are targeted with them. The share of US traffic attributed to income brackets is nearly identical to the share of traffic tracked to the ZIP code level in geographic reports. As such, Google’s progress in location tracking helps these targets account for a greater share of the population. Better tracking is better for advertisers ZIP code certainly isn’t the most granular location Google can track users to. Advertisers can target searchers as close as one kilometer from a specific address using AdWords radius targeting, and Google’s in-store visit tracking relies on tracking searchers to within feet of brick-and-mortar locations in order to credit ad campaigns with driving store visits. However, the share of US traffic that is tracked to ZIP code in the “Most specific location” column gives advertisers an idea of how well Google is able to track users to granular geographic locations. This information helps inform campaign targeting strategy over time. When Google was still only able to track about 70 percent of search traffic to the ZIP code level, advertisers that used only ZIP code-level geographic targeting were missing out on around 30 percent of traffic from those areas. Now that Google tracks much more traffic to the ZIP code level, that’s less of a concern, and advertisers can feel more comfortable using granular location targeting. As mentioned, search partner location tracking lags that of google.com, but search partners only accounted for 9 percent of all Merkle advertiser Google search clicks in Q4 2016. Thus, while we’d prefer to see more progress in location tracking on the partner network, these sites don’t account for a hugely significant share of traffic overall that can’t be identified at the ZIP code level. Whether it’s location or demographic audiences or any other type of search targeting, it’s safe to assume that Google will continue to progress in its ability to track user attributes for better ad targeting. This is a win for advertisers, as campaigns that target specific locations and groups are steadily targeting a greater share of the total population that falls into those locations and groups. It also increases the likelihood that the most correct bids are placed in the AdWords auction for campaigns which target larger geographic areas (such as the entire United States) but use smaller location targets (such as the ZIP code 22902) to adjust bids for users in specific areas. This will only help advertisers to invest more in paid search by helping marketers to spend each dollar as effectively as possible.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel 2 definitely coming this year, still as a premium flagship device By Rei Padla - March 3, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter It was only a couple of days ago when we heard Rick Osterloh saying there won’t be any new Pixel laptop at the moment. The tech giant doesn’t have any plans of releasing a follow-up to the Pixel C anytime soon. We understand the decision but we’re still curious to know if a new Pixel phone will be unveiled at least this 2017. The former President and COO of Motorola Mobility who returned to Google as new hardware SVP last year has been working with the Pixel team and looks like his group will roll out the next-gen Pixel phone. The Google Pixel 2 will be the formal follow-up to the Pixel and Pixel XL. That’s good to know despite reports of delays and some challenges along the way. It’s true that the Google Pixel is still in a bottleneck. We have no idea why exactly but we’ve been saying there is an audio issue and some flaw on the camera. As early as a few weeks ago, we already noted the possibility of a Pixel 2 and the Hardware VP himself is confirming its arrival. As to when, there is no information nor any hint but we’re guessing in the second half of the year. We’re also interested in how the Pixel 2 will be different from the first Pixel duo. The Pixel XL is a bit more powerful with the Daydream AR so we’re hoping the Pixel 2 will also have it as a standard feature. Details are scarce but we are confident that the next-gen Pixel 2 will arrive. This somehow proves that the Pixel phones were not launched as a one-time experiment. As the replacement for the Nexus phones, the Pixel devices better be worth all the hassle and yes, the high cost. We don’t think Google will release a mid-range or budget-friendly Pixel phone since Osterloh already confimred that the line will stay premium.

But it's not all happiness and sweetness, since voice is a commodity and telephony “calling” is now just another feature in a large scheme.  EVS, the next generation of mobile HD voice quality, is expected to grow significantly, according to advocate and EVS patent pool participant Fraunhofer.  It's already included in a number of Qualcomm mobile chipsets, with other vendors expected to add formal support early in 2017.  Phone support today includes the Samsung Note 5, Galaxy S6 and S7 families, Google Pixel, and phones from LG, Sony, HTC, Xiaomi, and HP, among others. Network support for superwideband EVS includes T-Mobile in the U.S., NTT DoCoMo in Japan, Vodafone Germany, and all of the largest South Korean LTE operators. Other mobile operators worldwide are testing EVS and are expected to launch services soon; I suspect we'll have a couple of announcements out around Mobile World Congress (MWC). Voice interfaces and voice assistants have been kicking around for a while on Apple and Google phones, with Cortana coming to the forefront with Windows 10 gains.  But most of the buzz and momentum is with Amazon's Alexa. It doesn't have the deep knowledge and flexibility of Google, but the speakers in the device are great and voice recognition is spot on for both close (near-field) and far away (far-field).   CES was filled with Alexa (and a number of Google Home, to be fair) compatibility announcements, with third-parties able to splice services and devices into Alexa via APIs.  In the near future, you may see “Alexa clones,” hardware built by third-parties but designed specifically to tap into Amazon's Alexa voice recognition/voice assistant functionality.  Amazon gains by having more data flowing into its analytics engines, giving it better information and ways to improve the baseline service.  Every “I don't know the answer to that question” from Alexa is also another “Gee, maybe we should add this feature” for its architects. Perhaps the killer app for Alexa and its Google Home counterpart will be the addition of calling and telephony services. There's been some shade tossed that Amazon needs to “master” things like porting phone numbers and 911 services, but given the mastery of VoIP technology by numerous start-ups (and failed, due to business plan, not tech), it shouldn't be hard.  Companies have been running baseline VoIP services over Amazon Web Services (AWS) for some time. And the talk of adding phone services to Alexa and Google Home should stir the hearts of Ooma and Vonage.  The fastest way to add knowledge, relationships, and VoIP technology (and patents, if you think you need them) is to acquire a company.  Ooma has been running VoIP connected to the legacy phone network for years, so you could check off the 911 support box immediately once you bought it.  However, Ooma also has been doing a lot of expansive things beyond stock phone calls, including home monitoring and... linking Alexa to Ooma.   Imagine buying an Alexa and getting Ooma phone calling built-in.  All the vital bits already exist between the Alexa voice front end and Ooma's telephony network, with Ooma as an Alexa still released back in 2016. Yes, I think Amazon should buy Ooma.  It's a great fit, especially when you consider Ooma also has built its own bespoke hardware and added to its portfolio over the years. The only downside to voice calling is that there's no money to squeeze out of it and little sizzle.  When I was at ITEXPO a couple weeks ago, long-time VoIP guru and start-up patron Andy Abramson shared a discussion he recently had with a VoIP cloud provider.   About a decade or so ago, Andy told the company that there was a list of dozens of go-to reporters dedicated to covering the VoIP space.  Today, publications are interested in the hot trinity of AI, The Internet of Things (IoT), and cybersecurity – not VoIP or voice. Voice is just another building block, from my perspective.  It needs to work correctly when interwoven with other applications, but there's no “secret sauce” or revolutionary breakthroughs needed for high-quality voice and speech-to-text that feed into natural language processing and voice analytics engines. This isn't to say companies can't make a good living doing cloud PBX services, but voice telephony is a commodity world that runs on pennies to fractions of a penny for profit.  That's a harsh business, requiring economies of scale and the size of an Amazon or other cloud provider to truly make healthy profits.

Matt McGee on March 3, 2017 at 2:11 pm More All eyes were on Snap this week, as the parent company of Snapchat had a successful IPO on Thursday that immediately valued the company above non-tech stalwarts like CBS, Delta Airlines, Target and others. But there are legitimate questions about the future of advertising on Snapchat and how well the social platform can continue to monetize its userbase. In this week’s episode of Marketing Land Live, we talk about what Snap’s IPO might mean for digital advertisers and some of the hurdles the company may have to overcome to attract more ad dollars. Other topics this week include the announcement of YouTube TV and how video advertising will work when it launches, and the relationship between fake news/hyperpartisan web sites and the Google Display Network.

The word from Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of hardware at the search giant, is the Google Pixel 2 will indeed release this year. He revealed as much to Android Pit during a conversation at this week's MWC conference.  Osterloh said we can "count on" Google following the industry's annual release cycle when it comes to the handset, at least for the 2017 edition.  "You can count on a successor this year," he said of Pixel, "even if you don't hear a date from me now." Staying premium Osterloh also said Google doesn't plan to turn the Pixel into a lower-tier device: "Pixel stays premium," he proclaimed. Apparently when pressed, Osterloh never deviated from his response that Pixel is a premium product. Google will let other hardware makers battle it out for cheaper phone supremacy. This may be disappointing to some who were hoping for a budget Pixel. Rumors suggested a cheaper version was in the works, but it appears Osterloh has put those to bed. Never say never, however, as Google could surprise with a budget Pixel edition down the line. As for the Pixel 2, Osterloh didn't offer up any details on what we can expect from the phone. Previous reports suggest it will be a significant upgrade, especially in the camera and chipset departments, and that one or both versions of the Pixel 2 may even go waterproof.

This week, we follow up on the launch of Google’s new ad label to ask how it will impact marketers, and look at attempts by Google’s tech incubator Jigsaw to clean up language on the internet. Plus, a new study has revealed that 63% of top-ranking websites use keywords in their URL, and Bing has a new function that allows you to filter restaurants by Pokéstop. How will Google’s new ‘Ad’ label impact marketers? In last week’s round-up we reported that after some testing, Google has officially rolled out a new look for its ad labels on the SERP. But the question on everyone’s lips is: how will this affect marketing campaigns? Clark Boyd took a detailed look at the possible implications of the chance for Search Engine Watch this week, including considering why Google has chosen to change the look of the ad labels, the impact it will have on paid search CTR, and the possible effect on organic search. Google’s Jigsaw aims to increase the quality of online conversations Jigsaw, the technology incubator formerly known as Google Ideas, has launched an API which aims to rid the web of bad comments. Called Perspective, the API “uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation” and can be used to identify and filter out comments that are likely to be “toxic.” When fed the content of a comment, the API will give a percentage rating as to how similar it is to “toxic” comments. Perspective uses machine learning models to determine the likelihood of a comment being toxic. Needless to say there has been some skepticism over how well this model can work, but it’s already being tested out by a number of prominent publishers, including the likes of the New York Times, the Guardian and Wikipedia. Al Roberts took a look at the issue for ClickZ, and considered whether a human issue like online abuse can really be solved by machines. Google’s DeepMind app is saving NHS nurses two hours a day There was significant controversy surrounding DeepMind, the Artificial Intelligence arm of Google, last November when it was revealed to be at the center of a massive data-sharing agreement involving the medical information of more than 1.6 million patients. But the NHS Royal Free London Hospital, which is trialing an app by DeepMind designed to detect early signs of kidney failure, has spoken out in defense of the technology and revealed that it is saving nurses up to two hours every day. The logo for Streams, the real-time health information app by DeepMind. Wired UK reported that more than 26 doctors and nurses at Royal Free are using the app, which is “alerting” them up to 11 times per day of patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). According to NHS figures, acute kidney disease costs them more than £1 billion every year – although it’s unknown how much the NHS is paying DeepMind for the use of its technology. “Within a few weeks of being introduced, nurses who have been using Streams report it has been saving them up to two hours every day, which means they can spend more time face-to-face with patients,” the hospital said in a statement.

Comparing keyword research APIs: Spyfu vs SEMRush vs Serpstat and more Make no mistake: content errors harm your brand and SEO How will Google’s new 'Ad' label impact marketers? Study: 63% of top-ranking websites use keywords in their URL How beneficial is it to have keywords in your domain URL? There has been little definitive information to answer this question over the years. Matt Cutts and John Mueller, both of Google, have previously gone on record (one in 2009, and the other in 2016) to state that keywords do make some contribution to search ranking. But what does this look like in practice, and how does it vary across different industries? A study by HigherVisibility, shared exclusively with Search Engine Watch, set out to answer this very question, analyzing the top ranking websites for various keywords across ten major industries. The study found that nearly two-thirds (63%) of top-ranked websites use keywords in their domain URL. Of the industries studied, the debt industry had the highest incidence of keywords in domain URLs with 76%, while email marketing had the lowest, with 47%. Read the full write-up and analysis of the findings. Bing lets you filter restaurants by Pokéstop What are the qualities of the ideal restaurant? Good food, ambiance…. nearby Pokéstop? If you would pick the last of these, you’re in luck, because Bing now allows you to filter restaurants by whether or not they have a Pokéstop nearby. The SEM Post’s Jennifer Slegg was the one to notice the change, which hasn’t been publicized by Bing in any way. So far the feature is only available in US search, but it could be a boost for some businesses. Wired reported in September 2016 that one in 10 US smartphone users were still playing the game, and a slew of new Pokémon have been introduced since then. Maybe now would be a good time to splurge on a lure or two. Rebecca Sentance is the Deputy Editor at ClickZ and Search Engine Watch.

Krieger | lkrieger@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 3, 2017 at 8:58 am | UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 11:35 am Google is using the power of computer-based reasoning to detect breast cancer, training the tool to look for cell patterns in slides of tissue, much the same way that the brain of a doctor might work. New findings show that this approach — enlisting machine learning, predictive analytics and pattern recognition — has achieved 89 percent accuracy, beyond the 73 percent score of a human pathologist. Related Articles Google researcher identified as motorcycle crash victim Apple, Google, Tesla and others threatened by expected Trump tariff or tax Google’s YouTube TV launching “soon”: 40-plus channels for $35 per month Google self-driving car spin-off Waymo sues Uber, accuses ex-manager of stealing files Murder of Google’s Vanessa Marcotte: DNA profile of killer released “We showed that it was possible to train a model that either matched or exceeded the performance of a pathologist who had unlimited time to examine the slides,” according to a blog item in Google Research posted by technical lead Martin Stumpe and product manager Lily Peng. Pathologists have always faced a huge data problem in obtaining an accurate diagnosis. A massive amount of information — slides containing cells from tissue biopsies, thinly sliced and stained — must be scanned in search of any abnormal cells. And time is of the essence. There can be many slides per patient. And each slide contains more than 10 gigapixels when digitized at 40 times magnification, according to the Google team. “Imagine having to go through a thousand 10-megapixel photos, and having to be responsible for every pixel,” the team wrote. As a result, even well-trained doctors may arrive at different conclusions, or miss the small percentage of images crucial to identifying pathologies. For example, agreement in diagnosis for some forms of breast cancer and prostate cancer can be as low as 48 percent, according to Google. Google’s approach is to input vast amounts of data into its system, then train it to look for patterns. It’s called “deep learning” — a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate what needs to be done. The Google team found that the system can autonomously learn what pathology looks like. The computer was educated by studying billions of images donated from Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Its algorithms were optimized for localization of breast cancer that has spread, or metastasized, to lymph nodes adjacent to the breast. Google Research’s work offers the latest proof that artificial intelligence no longer exists just in the realm of science fiction, but can be used to help humans. Research teams are embedded throughout Google to tackle tough problems, using computer science to confront related challenges through data-mining and artificial intelligence. Previously, the team applied deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection, by scanning photos, of retinal damage in patients with diabetes. Other companies are also exploring the field. IBM — which developed the Watson technology that triumphed on the TV show “Jeopardy!” — has shown that its system can autonomously learn what a pathology looks like — say, abnormal narrowing in a coronary artery, according to Technology Review,  published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The computer’s education is being sped up by studying 30 billion images from hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations that IBM recently acquired in its $1 billion purchase of Merge Healthcare, the journal reported. Computers won’t replace doctors, Google said. They lack a human’s breadth of knowledge and experience. For example, a computer can’t detect abnormalities that it hasn’t been trained to classify, such as different types of cancer. But perhaps a computer could automatically alert the doctor to the most important images. Or it could help doctors more easily and accurately measure tumor size — a factor that is linked to prognosis. “To ensure the best clinical outcome for patients, these algorithms need to be incorporated in a way that complements the pathologist’s workflow,” the Goggle team wrote.

Naturally, you delivered, so now we’re here to provide you with our answers.  This week, questions ranged in topic, covering what we expect from Google I/O this year, at what price the LG G6 is a good buy, and if Android Wear 2.0 has reinvigorated our love for Google’s smartwatch platform. Oh, we also got asked about beer, too. Awesome. Let’s get to it. Reminder: K is Kellen, T is Tim. What are your expectations for I/O this year? K:  Google Assistant everywhere. My guess is that Google Home will see a bunch of new features too, or we’ll see partners build Assistant into other products like Home. In other words, Assistant will be opened up on some level because Google will have to if it ever wants to try and catch Amazon. I also think we might see this merging of Chrome OS and Android in some form. Google can keep denying it all they want, but it makes a lot of sense to have the wealth of Android apps available to Chromebooks and not in this super janky beta state we have had since last IO. T:  Well, not to downplay anything that took place last year, but it was on the boring side. The biggest things announced were Google Home, Android Wear 2.0, and Google Assistant. To me, Google Home is awesome, but it relates directly to Google Assistant. The same for Android Wear 2.0. What makes that update special is support for Google Assistant. Even Allo, for example, has Assistant, too! To sum it up, I/O 2016 was about a digital assistant. For me, I’m ready for something bigger and better. The LG G6 looks like a good phone. At what price point is it a good buy? K:  Well, Google is still selling the Pixel from $650, yet the G6 features so much more like IP68 water resistance, a bigger higher-res display, dual cameras, and an ultra premium design that isn’t an iPhone clone. I’d say it’s probably worth at least $650, probably even more. I know that some will complain about the Snapdragon 821, but that chipset isn’t really that old. I doubt Qualcomm has offered some massive discount on the 821 to OEMs. It’d be nice to get it at $600, I just don’t think LG can do that. T:  Reports from Korea say that its G6 model will be priced at 899,800 KRW, which converts to about $780. To me, that’s bad news for LG. You’re asking folks to pay Samsung and Apple prices for something they may not be sure about. If it was up to me, which it isn’t, I’d shoot for $599. However, considering the features it has (IP68, wireless charging, dual cameras), I don’t see LG being able to meet such a competitive price. When you offer high-end specs and features, you have to charge reasonably for it. Does LG have the marketing power to convince US consumers to spend nearly $800 on their smartphone? We’ll find out soon enough. What’s your go to beer at the moment? K:  Block 15 Sticky Hands. Best IPA in the business in my opinion. T:  Occidental’s Hefeweizen. Yum yum! If you could live anywhere else in the world, where would it be? K:  I don’t know that I’ve ever really thought about it, but probably some place warm that doesn’t rain 800 days per year like Portland. While I love Portland, living on a beach and seeing the sun most days would be a solid life. T:  I’d love a spot in the woods. Northern California, probably. My original home. Thoughts on the return of the Nokia 3310? K:  Couldn’t care less. T:  There’s a reason it’s not coming to the US. It’s dumb. Name a movie that you hate but everyone else seems to love. K:  Avatar. T:  I can’t think of a movie right off, but I can give you a TV show: Westworld. It’s cool enough, but I’m not in love with its storytelling the same way others appear to be. What’s your take on bezel-less displays? Gimmick or awesome? K:  After using the LG G6 for most of the week, I think this is a smart way to do it. The phone has almost all display that’s flat, but there are still bezels that allow you to not accidentally press the side of a display every time you grab the phone. I’m actually worried about the Galaxy S8 and am assuming that its curved, zero-edge display is going to be a nightmare for accidental presses. T:  The G6’s display and design is no gimmick. It’s actually quite nice. Provided there’s no curving going on, it makes handling the phone very easy. I share Kellen’s concerns about Samsung’s implementation on the Galaxy S8. I shall reserve judgement, though. Thoughts on Android Wear 2.0? Enough to bring you back? K:  Outside of the UI changing a bit upfront, it’s really not a huge change overall. Everything still works mostly the same. NFC in some watches for payments will be a nice addition, but there still isn’t a lot there to get people on board, I don’t think. The big complaints we still have are mostly around battery life and charging. Wear 2.0 certainly doesn’t fix that. T:  I have yet to see a smartwatch that gets me excited about Android Wear again. The last time I felt good about it was the Huawei Watch and Moto 360 (OG and 2nd Gen). The new Huawei Watch looks pretty terrible and the Watch Sport is just too big. The OS itself is fine for me, it’s cool, but the hardware needs to be even better. C’mon, OEMs, you can do better! Check out our previous Q&A posts!

Also, try not to be so bashing on struggling companies, other than maybe Saygus. I’ve heard Tim awhile back talk about wanting a certain big brand to “just die already”, then later say he wants an companies to succeed. More players in the game equals more push for new innovations and more choice. Imagine if it was just Apple and Samsung. It would be a very boring time and tough for you to write posts. One last thing, instead of saying the Nokia feature phone is “dumb”, just say it’s not for you. Peace. trixnkix637 You’re criticizing opinion articles. Just think about that for a minute. KOBALT He’s a concerned reader. trixnkix637 Which would be fine if he wasn’t concerned about the writer voicing their opinion in opinion articles lol. Kind of criticizes the point of such a thing and negates his concerns in a way. AValadez4471 Does anyone know if the S8 will take a 256gb memory card? Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of course. The S7 does.

The news comes from Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of hardware, via AndroidPIT. Osterloh couldn’t announce a release date for the successor to the Pixel but confirmed plans for the new smartphone lineup. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it.” Osterloh said to AndroidPIT. “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now.” Osterloh also confirmed Google would keep the Pixel 2 at a similar premium price. Right now, the Google Pixel’s retail hardware starts at $649 and phones with a lower price point are left to alternative manufacturers like LG and Samsung. The news comes as Google finds the Pixel smartphone series in a tricky position. Since its release last fall, the Pixel and Pixel XL have earned strong marks from reviewers but the smartphones have been plagued by inventory issues and models have frequently been out of stock. While Google has dabbled with taking a more direct hardware role in the past via the Nexus series, the Pixel is a de facto flagship device for the company. For Google, the company took on a much more hands-on approach during the design and hardware development process. As the Pixel 2 aims to target the same upscale audience, it’s clear that Google wants the phone to continue to be in same discussion as market leaders like Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy series.

Home World news Good news: Tech giant Google raises file atttachment size in Gmail accounts to 50 MB Good news: Tech giant Google raises file atttachment size in Gmail accounts to 50 MB The US-based tech giant has increased the attachment size of its mailing service from 25 MB to 50 MB. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 4, 2017 12:03 AM The step has been taken as many account holders send their data through emails. (Reuters) The US-based tech giant has increased the attachment size of its mailing service from 25 MB to 50 MB, a report by News18.com has said. As per the report, the step has been taken as many account holders send their data through emails. However, the company has limited this feature only for emails ‘received’ by account users and anyone mailing an attached file has to adjust with the current 25 MB limit, the report added. In February, Google has announced that its Gmail service will stop working on some Chrome browsers by the end of 2017. According to a blog posted by Google, it has informed that Gmail will stop working on 53 or lower version of its Chrome browser. The process of stopping Gmail for working on these versions will start from February 8 itself. This move by Google, essentially means that it’s time for Windows XP and Windows Vista users, to start worrying, as they will not be able to use the emailing feature of Google on their Chrome browser. It had also said that the Chrome browser’s versions lower than 53 were open to security risks, mainly because Microsft had stopped the OS support for Windows XP and Vista. This means that if you are still using Chrome v53 or lower, be ready to likely get affected by attacks. Moreover, there will be no bug fixes or security patches available to you. According to Google, you will be able to continue using the Chrome browser till the end of the year, but it will be in the basic HTML version only. Google wrote on the blog, “Gmail users that are still on Windows XP and Windows Vista are the most likely to be affected because v49 was the last released version which supported those operating systems.” You may also like to watch this vdeo Google said that Gmail users who are still on Chrome browser v53 or below will be flashed a message or banner on their screens. In the blog post, Google said, “Google does not typically announce when we discontinue support for older versions of Chrome browser because of our current supported browser policy, which states that only the most recent versions of Chrome are supported. This announcement was made given the expected impact on Windows XP and Windows Vista users and known security risks.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Mar 3, 2017 at 1:15PM Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that is still in the early stages of adoption. While headsets are available, VR has yet to gain wide acceptance due to the high cost of consoles and equipment, and the lack of sufficient content. Additionally, the technology is still largely unfamiliar to the majority of consumers, who may have heard of VR but have yet to experience it. All that may be beginning to change. Pearl is the first VR movie to be nominated for an Oscar. Image source: Google. For the first time, a movie created specifically to be viewed in VR was nominated for an Academy Award. Though the film didn't win, it may act as a touchstone for consumers. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Spotlight Stories, a VR storytelling venue, has for the last several years produced 360-degree and VR films in the form of animated shorts. This allowed filmmakers to reimagine storytelling and for technicians from Google's Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP) to hone the nascent technology.  Its Oscar-nominated short, Pearl, is centered on the life and times of a musical father and daughter traveling the country in pursuit of stardom. The animated scenes all take place from the point-of-view of a passenger in the front seat of their car. The ground-breaking film was directed by Patrick Osbourne who received an Oscar in 2015 for his work on Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Feast, a short film about a man and his adopted dog, which debuted in 2014. This highlights a recent push by filmmakers and the movie industry to embrace the technology.  Meanwhile, legendary director Steven Spielberg is fronting a new VR start-up, Dreamscape Immersive, which recently raised $11 million in funding from several Hollywood studios. Focusing on location-based virtual reality, the company plans to open a VR multiplex in Los Angeles later this year. This comes on the heels of a similar location-based offering that is the result of a partnership between Google and IMAX Corporation (NYSE:IMAX). The companies joined forces to create a cinema grade VR camera using Google's Jump platform which seamlessly integrates 360-degree video into a panoramic view. Last month, IMAX opened its pilot VR center in Los Angeles and based on its early success, the company plans to open five additional test locations by mid-year. This model incorporates original material, as well as content that expands on big budget films, such as Disney's Star Wars series, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.'s John Wick movies, and Hasbro's Transformers franchise.  Samsung Gear VR. Image source: Samsung.  In another sign that VR is gaining a wider audience Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) released apps for its leading streaming service that will work with several commercially available headsets including the Facebook's Oculus Rift, Samsung's Gear VR, and Google Daydream View.  The app features a virtual living room where viewers can connect with the familiar Netflix interface to select programs for viewing. Website ScreenRant.com detailed a list of movies that lend themselves to VR, without being specific to the technology. While Netflix is not providing any actual VR content, this is an acknowledgement that the public may be ready for more in the way of interacting with VR technology. VR is still in its infancy and it will be some time before it gains widespread adoption. Hollywood is leading the charge with location-based options that will supplement the home VR market. This provides evidence that the technology is gaining ground, and the tipping point may be closer than we imagine.

When you connect to the free Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop, you're probably not overly concerned with security. But if the network isn't secured, it's possible that one of the other patrons is spying on your every move as you surf the Web, learning your passwords, banking information, and secrets. There's also no way to tell if the network you're connecting to is even being run by the coffee shop. It could just be a cleverly named surrogate, created to lure patrons like yourself into connecting. This kind of man-in-the-middle attack is more common than you might think. At the Black Hat security conference, I saw first hand how even trained security professionals, hackers, and passersby fell for what was clearly a bogus network. This particular attack took advantage of the fact that many phones and computers will automatically try to reconnect to familiar networks. By mimicking any network ID a victim requests, the attacker captures connections. It's a convenient feature, but one that opens you up to attack. A VPN can't protect you against every threat, but it's a simple and effective way to lock down your network security. With a VPN, your traffic is routed through a secure and encrypted tunnel to the VPN service's server. From there, it enters the wide and wild Internet. The practical upshot is that anyone on your local network or monitoring your connection to the VPN's server won't be able to peek at your data. VPNs also provide a modicum of privacy. Should attackers or advertisers try to gather your IP address or discern your location, they'll see the info for the VPN server instead. This facet of VPN services also means that you can spoof your location by connecting to a far-flung VPN server. Political activists and journalists use this feature to reach the rest of the world when operating within countries with restrictive Internet laws. The average person can use this to access region-locked content, like Major League Baseball live streams or BBC programming. Features and Pricing The Norton WiFi Privacy app is free to download from Google Play, but you won't be able to do anything with the app unless you spring for a $29.99 year-long subscription. Thankfully, there's a seven-day free trial but you'll have to authorize the app as if you were paying for it up front. The subscription and payments are entirely app based and handled through Google Play. That means that you pay for it the same you would any other in-app purchase. It's a little counter-intuitive, however, because Google makes it appear as if you are going to be charged immediately when in reality you have a seven-day trial period. If you want to cancel your subscription, you can do so easily through the Account section of the Google Play app. Norton does not offer any other billing options, which is unfortunate. Most other services let you choose between a monthly billing cycle and a prorated annual billing option. KeepSolid VPN Unlimited goes further, offering billing options that cover just a few days—a great choice for travelers looking to get just a few days of protection. I much prefer these more flexible plans. If you opt to purchase Norton WiFi Privacy from Norton's website, you'll find a few more pricing options. A yearly subscription for one device costs $49.99, currently marked down to $39.99. Five devices costs $79.99, also currently marked down to $39.99. 10 devices runs $99.99, currently marked down to $59.99. Note that these lower rates are just for the first year. After that, they'll jump up to their usual levels. Importantly, these subscriptions can be used to cover other Android devices, PCs, Macs, and iOS devices, too. Norton also offers a 60-day money back guarantee, twice the duration of the competition, and a $119.98 ($79.98 for the first year) bundle that includes Norton Security Deluxe with five licenses for both products. Note that if you purchase a subscription through the Android app, it won't work for other devices. The slightly more expensive subscription on the Norton website is the way to go if you also want to protect PCs, Macs, Android, and iOS devices. Some services, such as TorGuard, go even further, offering routers with VPN software preinstalled, providing protection for every device connected to the network. TorGuard also provides five devices in its base subscription with the option to add additonal devices for a fee. While that $29.99 price tag can look intimidating, it works out to about $2.50 a month. That's well below nearly every other service's monthly billing option, but doesn't beat out other services when you look at their annual plans. Spotflux VPN and KeepSolid offer plans for $4.99 a month or annual plans for $25 and $29.99, respectively. There are even free VPN services that are worth investigating, if price is a major issue. Norton also has comparatively few servers in even fewer locations. According to Norton, the company currently offers 25 server locations with at least two different servers in each location. To its credit, Norton has a geographically diverse collection of server locations, touching Africa, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and the South Pacific. No matter where you travel, you're sure to find at least one server on the same continent. But for international travelers, or users keen to spoof their location to specific locales, this will not be enough. Editors' Choice winner Private Internet Access, on the other hand, has thousands of servers in hundreds of locations across the globe. The number and location of servers matters a lot. If you're using a VPN, you want a server close by in order to reduce latency and to have a better overall experience. If you're interested in spoofing your location, numerous servers and locations give you more options. A solid offering of servers also opens the door for specialized servers. Editors' Choice Winner NordVPN, for example, has specific servers for watching videos, accessing the Tor network, and exchanging files over BitTorrent (or the P2P network of your choice)—even when using your Android device. Norton doesn't allow file sharing, nor does it have specific servers for different activities. Hands On With Norton WiFi Privacy With its Android app, Norton offers a clean, focused experience. The app is centered around a large circle showing the current location of your Web traffic. Page elements are colored red or green depending on whether or not the VPN is active. The color changes stand out starkly in the app's sparse design, which is smart and eye-catching. A typical Android power button sits in the lower right corner in typical material design style. Buttons across the top give quick access to app settings, location information, and ad-blocking controls. One of the best features of the app is the ability to have Norton automatically activate the VPN whenever your phone connects to an unsecured Wi-Fi network. If you're not a fan of automation, you can toggle this off and opt to receive warnings about the network's lack of security instead. Ad-blocking software is currently unavailable in the official Google Play store, meaning you cannot escape the tyranny (or necessity, depending on your point of view) of Web ads on your Android device. Apple, it should be noted, does allow ad-blocking apps like 1Blocker, which blocks ads in the Safari browser. Some VPN services, including Norton, will block ads, making them rare and valuable commodities for Android devotees. Of the VPN apps I've tested, Private Internet Access and Spotflux VPN are the only others that also block ads on Android. By default, Norton WiFi Privacy will select the closest VPN server to your current location. Proximity can have a major impact on performance, and a closer server usually ensures a better experience. Some users, however, may want to make it appear as if their Web traffic is coming from somewhere else. To do that, you can manually select from a list and the app will connect. Other VPN services offer many more servers and locations, as well as search functions, speed tests, and specialized servers. Norton's offering is adequate in this regard, but I hope to see it grow in the future. Speed Tests Using a VPN will have some effect on your Internet connection. In most cases, the strain of bouncing data to a remote server and back again increases latency and lowers download and upload speeds. In some rare cases, VPNs can improve Web performance, usually by connecting you to higher bandwidth infrastructure. When testing VPNs on desktop computers, I found that PureVPN greatly increased download speeds, for example. I have yet to see this effect with an Android VPN, however. VPNs can secure cellular traffic, too, but cellular connections are harder to control in a lab environment. In my testing, I shut off the cellular radio on my Nexus 5x before running a series of speed tests using the Ookla app (Ookla is owned by PCMag publisher Ziff Davis). VPN protection for cellular connections is important because an attacker with a good amount of technical know-how, a portable cell tower such as a Femtocell, and a broad-spectrum jammer could intercept your cellular data. This is, as readers will no doubt guess, a rather exotic attack—but it's not unheard of. All of my tests use the automatically selected server, which in this case was located in Kansas. Your mileage, particularly in other countries, may vary. I found that the Norton WiFi Privacy app increased network latency by 342.2 percent. That's a significant increase, but not the worst I have seen by far. The NordVPN Android app had the lowest latency of any mobile VPN I've yet tested, increasing latency by only 32 percent. Norton was not the fastest VPN the download or upload tests. I found it decreased download speeds by 54.5 percent. The Private Internet Access app has the best score in this test, decreasing download speeds by only 10.3 percent. Norton's performance was, however, on the higher end of average for this test. In the upload test, Norton slowed uploads by 58.3 percent, making it the second slowest uploading mobile VPN I've yet tested. The Spotflux VPN Android app actually improved upload performance, increasing upload speeds by 6.5 percent. Numbers are just numbers; it's the experience that really matter. During my time with Norton WiFi Privacy I found that media-heavy pages seemed to load nearly as quickly as they did without VPN. Web-optimized pages, like Google's AMP pages, loaded almost instantaneously. Unfortunately, I found that Netflix was blocked when I was using Norton WiFi Privacy. The same is true for nearly every other VPN service (and the associated Android apps) I've tested. At issue is geographic-specific licensing deals Netflix carries out. Show and movie availability varies by country, due to the way licenses are negotiated. Room to Grow Norton WiFi Privacy has a great design, a friendly interface, and a familiar sign-up process that's sure to put users at ease. I particularly like its ad-blocking powers, and its ability to automatically activate VPN protection when you connect to an unsecured Wi-Fi network. Norton's recent addition of new platforms for WiFi privacy, including desktops and iPhones, make it a more useful option, too. My enthusiasm is offset, however, by the service's inflexible and relatively high up-front price, its limited number of servers, and its limited subscription options. For now, I'll continue to recommend Editors' Choice VPN Android apps NordVPN and Private Internet Access.

Cons Six-month licensing. Bottom Line Mind mapping software solution Expert Software Applications Mindomo is the Editors' Choice winner for its Comments feature that strengthens its social prowess and mind-mapping power. By Evan Koblentz, Suzanne Kattau Expert Software Applications Mindomo is an mind mapping and idea management software that's available in cloud and desktop versions. I tested the cloud version because the desktop version requires Adobe Air, which is not widely supported. Expert Software Applications Mindomo begins at $36 per user for a six-month-long license. Fortunately, the product itself is all business and wins our Editors' Choice award in this mind mapping software solution review roundup. And, unusually, Expert Software Applications Mindomo licenses are sold in 6-month increments. That is my only major complaint; why not make them available in year-long increments? There are Premium, Professional, and Team versions. Licenses cost $36 per user, $90 per user with five guests, and $162 for five users, respectively. There is special pricing for academic customers. //Compare Similar Products Compare Bloomfire   %displayPrice%%seller% XMind   %displayPrice%%seller% Front & Main Honey   %displayPrice%%seller% Mindjet MindManager 2016 for Windows   %displayPrice%%seller% Ideaflip   %displayPrice%%seller% Corso Innovation Management   %displayPrice%%seller% Datastation Innovation Cloud   %displayPrice%%seller% iMindQ   %displayPrice%%seller% Idearium   %displayPrice%%seller% Setting Up Using solely the cloud version requires you to visit the website and log in with MindManager or Google credentials. You can select your preferred language and create new maps, starting with more than 50 themes in basic, business, and education categories. Access existing maps by using the import feature or by clicking on maps that other users share with you. Alternately, you can get more maps from the Expert Software Applications website. Users can also customize their default views and calendar availability for task assignments. Interface and Usability At first glance, the Mindomo interface seems sparse. Across the top, I found menus for returning to the start-up dashboard, standard file management tools, undo/redo, insert a topic or relationship, share, view changes (which are similar features found in XMind), or view as a presentation. On the left-hand side, there are icons for adding notes, links, images, tasks, and so forth. I can imagine the notes feature being very useful. Users can install browser extensions for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. The map itself has novel features. A playback mode shows which users made what changes and when they made them. In this mode, a chat feature becomes available when multiple users are online simultaneously, and there is a bookmarks feature for storing content that you might use in different maps (so you don't have to go find it every time). You will also find a markers feature, which offers a variety of map icons but isn't quite as useful as the markers in XMind. Download and print options are there when you right-click in any blank part of a map. You'd think this is common, but in Mindomo, it is very simple and the file format options are surprisingly plentiful. Maps can be shared in formats such as HTML and RSS, and there is Google Docs and Office 365 integration (along with other backup functions to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneBox, or an FTP account). Plus, there's additional integration with learning applications. Maps can be password protected as well. Map leaves are condensed to show only their titles and subjects, with full details being viewable by clicking a plus sign. The application's secret weapon is an unassuming icon labeled Comments. This opens a resizable window in which you can comment on any part of a map and "like" or "dislike" any particular leaf. Effectively, that combines the social prowess of the Bloomfire and Front & Main Honey approach with the mapping powers of XMind and Mindjet MindManager 2016 for Windows—the best of both worlds. This one feature is what separates Expert Software Applications Mindomo from its competition. I'd like to see it adopted by other companies. Meanwhile, Mindomo would be smart to make the feature prominent, instead of leaving it as just another bland icon in a navigation bar. Expert Software Applications Mindomo's mobile applications are very straightforward. I tried the Android version which loads into an interface almost identical to the desktop version. It is simple to access your own maps or content that other users shared with you. A downside is the mobile menu icons are too small to comfortably select, even on my relatively huge Galaxy Note screen. I hope that is adjusted in a future version. In addition to regular help menus, Expert Software Applications Mindomo has an online customer discussion forum. Major categories are general discussion (these are mostly how-to posts), feature requests, and bug submissions. Among the feature requests, there are so many good ideas that it makes me long to see Expert Software Applications Mindomo offer a software developer kit (SDK). In the bugs category, it is somewhat concerning to see so many posts, but it's a pleasure when any software company is so transparent of their issues. Company officials said that some of the features due in the near future include analysis of cause/effect changes to maps, more customization for map label elements, a way to transform maps into outlines (which is already part of XMind and Mindjet MindManager 2016 for Windows), and a way to plan and predict logic debates. Conclusion Expert Software Applications Mindomo wins an Editors' Choice award because their product includes powerful aspects of mind mapping software coupled with the social aspects of knowledge management services. It is the only product in the five reviewed in this roundup that touches both sides of the social or mapping fence. This is what the wider category of mind mapping applications should always aim to do. However, I'm giving it a score of 4 out of 5—which is higher than the other products in this review but still leaves room for improvement. Expert Software Applications Mindomo could be considered the least-flawed product of the bunch. Its foray into social networking is unique but still doesn't touch the abilities of Bloomfire or Front & Main Honey.

Name: Subject: Message: Android Studio 2.3 has a bunch of improvements for app developers Android Development Newsby John Callaham4 days ago 2 2904 13 Android app developers now have a new version of Google’s Android Studio tools to check out. The company released the new 2.3 version earlier this week, and Google says that it concentrates on offering improvements to the tools, although there are a few small new features thrown in as well. See also: How to build an image gallery app – full tutorial with code October 3, 2016 In case you didn’t know, Android Studio is Google’s official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for making Android apps, including tools for coding the app and design software for creating its user interface. Android Studio 2.3 includes some improvements and changes to Instant Run. Developers who use the “Run” action will now always cause an application restart, so they can see any changes in the app’s code that may require a restart. Also, there’s a new “Apply Changes” action that will make changes to that code while the app itself continues to run. Build Cache has now been turned on by default in Android Studio 2.3, after first being introduced in the previous 2.2 version. This new feature is designed to give developers a way to cache exploded AARs and pre-dexed external libraries, which in turn should lead to faster clean builds of their apps. The UI design tools in Android Studio 2.3 include support for Constraint Layout, which will allow developers to chain two or more Android views bi-directionally together to form a group on one dimension. Constraint Layout also support ratios for developers who want to maintain the aspect ratio of a widget. There’s lots of other improvements and small additions in this Android Studio 2.3 release, including an updated widget palette in the Layout Editor, the addition of  search and filtering in the vector asset wizard, and a new App Links Assistant that lets developers create new intent filters for their URLs. You can get a quick overview of what’s new and improved in the video above.

Also joining the Taoiseach at the meeting in Dublin were Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O’Connor TD, Minister of State for Employment and Small Business, Pat Breen TD, Sheelagh Daly of the Local Enterprise Offices and Martin Corry of Enterprise Ireland. A record 1,842 young entrepreneurs, aged between 18 and 35, have taken part in this year’s IBYE. The competition has progressed through county and regional stages where 24 young entrepreneurs have now emerged as national IBYE finalists and will compete for the prestigious title of Ireland’s Best Young Entrepreneur. The IBYE Final takes place at Google’s European Headquarters in Dublin on Sunday, March 5.  The Taoiseach met the national finalists at Government buildings, before the young entrepreneurs travelled to a pitch training session at Google. He said: “I am overwhelmed and inspired by the entrepreneurial talent that I have encountered here today.  In this fast-moving world, there can be no standing still and we must always stay ahead of the curve in terms of business. It is vital that we nurture our young businesspeople, encourage them, and give them supports as they strive to make an impact and to succeed.”  “We must also be mindful that today’s young entrepreneurs are tomorrow’s employers. IBYE, which is run by the Local Enterprise Offices, is one of the best innovations arising from the Action Plan for Jobs. While there are now nearly 190,000 people more in employment than when the Action Plan for Jobs was first launched in 2012, we must not be complacent. A lot of work still needs to be done to ensure a bright future for everyone in this country. All the young people I met today are Ireland’s future.”  Minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor TD commented: “These young entrepreneurs are shining examples of how Ireland can stand out and succeed in a highly competitive environment. Creativity, design, technology and innovation have been to the fore in this year’s IBYE. I want to congratulate the finalists here today and all who have participated in the competition so far and encourage them to keep going and realise their ambition. I also want to assure young entrepreneurs up and down the country that their Local Enterprise Office will be on hand every step of the way. I wish the finalists every success in the National IBYE final on March 5.”   Minister for Employment and Small Business, Pat Breen, TD, said: “IBYE is one of the most important vehicles we have to help encourage, motivate and kick-start new business in Ireland. The fact that there was a 32 per cent increase in entries in this year’s IBYE competition is a reflection that our young people are eager and hungry to follow their dreams and do it for themselves. Entrepreneurs such as these are a key force in helping to create jobs across every region.”  The IBYE competition is run by Local Enterprise Office Longford. Congratulating the local finalist and highlighting the benefits of the competition for young entrepreneurs, Michael Nevin, Head of Enterprise of the Local Enterprise Office Longford said: “Over the three years of the IBYE competition so far, more than 1,200 young entrepreneurs across the country have benefitted from taking part in IBYE Business Bootcamps and 360 have won investment funding for new or growing businesses. "By taking up the supports on offer through the Local Enterprise Office, we are seeing that even more young entrepreneurs are upskilling; they are developing and refining their plans and business models and they are using financial assistance to unlock new markets and expand their teams” Mr Nevin added: “Looking ahead to the national final of IBYE on March 5, we are very proud to be represented Brian O’Rourke, CitySwifter and we will continue to support them through every step of their journey.” A key motivator and showcase for Ireland’s young entrepreneurial talent, IBYE is run by the 31 Local Enterprise Offices nationwide and supported by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland. The initiative carries a total investment fund of €2 million. Already, 180 young entrepreneurs and business owners have benefitted from their participation in the earlier stages of the competition, receiving investments of between €3,000 and €15,000 each.  At the National Final, the overall winners and runners-up in the three IBYE categories – Best Business Idea, Best Start-up and Best Established Business will be announced and one of the three national category winners will be crowned ‘Ireland’s Best Young Entrepreneur’.    A winner and runner-up will be selected in each of the three IBYE categories, and along with the overall winner, will share the €100,000 national final investment fund at the awards ceremony on Sunday, March 5th.   Competition updates and YouTube videos for each of the national finalists are available through www.ibye.ie or by searching #IBYE on social media.   The IBYE National Final takes place on the first day of Local Enterprise Week, showcasing the range of enterprise supports available to small and micro businesses through every Local Enterprise Office.  READ MORE Events for start-ups, aspiring entrepreneurs and small businesses during Longford Local Enterprise Week Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500 Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition Teresa Reynolds (née Reynolds), who died on Friday, March 3, pictured with her three brothers Jim, Albert and Joe Reynolds (all now deceased) on the set of the BiBi TV show in the 1980's.

Ah, much better Storage news saved for the end of the week 3 Mar 2017 at 18:02, Chris Mellor TGI (Thank God It’s) Friday and so time to retrieve back burner storage news received in the week and bring it to the fore; Druva says its inSync product is now available on the Google G Suite Marketplace. It says enterprises can deploy Druva inSync directly through the G Suite Marketplace, making it simpler to manage data protection and information governance across endpoints and cloud applications. We’re told Druva is a Google Technology Partner, helping to ensure smooth integration for joint customers. Real-time analytics platform vendor Incorta has completed a $10 million Series A round of financing, led by GV (formerly Google Ventures). Incorta also announced itsDirect Data Mapping Engine which, rather than the traditional model of performing expensive and slow joins to combine data from different data sets, maps directly from each piece of data to all its related data thereby removing the need for costly join operations. This, Incorta says, this reduces query times from hours to seconds to enable real-time analysis, even at massive scale. Micron consumer products business Lexar has a 256GB Professional 1000x microSD UHS-II (U3) card.It has a read transfer speed up to 150MB/sec (1000x)1, a write speed of up to 90MB/sec, and includes a microSD UHS-II USB 3.0 reader for high-speed file transfer. It is designed for sports camcorders, tablets, and smartphones and is ‘Works with GoPro’ verified for compatibility with GoPro cameras. Lexar says the new card capacity will be available in Q1 of 2017 with an MSRP of $349.99 (£357.99). The Lexar Professional 1000x microSDXC/microSDHC™ cards are also available in the following capacities: 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB. To offer an even broader range of affordable performance options, the 256GB capacity High-Performance 633x microSDXC UHS-I card will move to UHS Speed Class 1 (U1) in Q1 of 2017 with an MSRP of $279.99 (£286.99). Hyper-converged appliance and storage array vendor Pivot3 has appointed Mark Maisano joining as vice president of channel sales. He joins Pivot3 from Acronis, and Ingram Micro and Seagate Technology before that, and will focus on building strategic partnerships and driving channels sales for multiple data-intensive systems in markets like video surveillance, end-user computing and data centre modernisation in the financial services, healthcare, transportation and defence markets. Riverbed’s SteelFusion v5.0 includes new support of Network Attached Storage alongside existing support for SAN and Object-based storage. It has surpassed 1,000 customers for SteelFusion, which is roughly speaking a server and WAN optimisation box in one package. Object storage vendor Scality has issued an “Aren’t we doing well!” release. It says it ended 2016 with 85 per cent year-over-year revenue growth ,with Q4 representing its largest quarter ever. Business booked through alliance partners soared to 76 per cent as the company’s new Scality ATLAS Partner Program was launched. This supports 25 global alliance and channel partners including Cisco, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Scality says it grew its installed base with 40+ new enterprise customers, bringing the total number of million-dollar accounts to 25 and total referenceable customers to 135. New customers came from across the USA, Western Europe, and Japan in the banking and finance, media and entertainment, manufacturing, and industrial design markets, with Scality capturing four of the world’s fifteen largest banks. CEO Jérôme Lecat bullishly exclaimed; “We have primed the engine for an explosive, growth-fueled new year.” The Storage Performance Council has concluded the development and early use phases of its SPC-1 V3 benchmark, which is a complete refresh of the SPC benchmark technology. Going forward, all SPC-1 benchmark results will be produced using SPC-1 V3. John Stephens, SPC Administrator, said; “The SPC-1 V3 benchmark is designed from the ground up for scalability and extreme I/O throughputs. SPC-1’s highly realistic data generation model is a dramatic advancement over the synthetic data generation models available in first generation compression and deduplication-aware load generators. It will reflect the realistic gains in space efficiency expected to occur in production environments when using compression and/or deduplication technology.” Huawei Technologies Storage Product Line president Meng Guangbin, said; “SPC-1 v3, with its audited and peer-reviewed results, gives Huawei the opportunity to compare our products with others on a level playing field based on objective metrics that reflect production conditions.” Another supportive vendor is IBM. Alistair Symon, VP for XIV and Storage Development at IBM, said; “As one of the founding members of the SPC, IBM was proud to sponsor the first SPC-1 V3 result and will continue to rely on it to showcase the real-life performance advantages of our storage products.” Backup software phenomenon Veeam has launched direct snapshot integration of the Veeam Availability Suite with the Cisco HyperFlex hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) platform. It says users will get; Improved Recovery Point Objectives – Using Backups from Storage Snapshots enables the user to run a backup at any time and any frequency, reducing a business’ exposure to data loss. Minimised Impact on Production – Not using VMware VM snapshots means the high impact of snapshot create and delete operations are eliminated. This dramatically reduces the performance impact on production VMs during the copy process. Accelerated Backups – Potentially improves copy speed up to twice as much compared to the standard as the standard VMware vSphere APIs, through the unique ability to backup data directly from the file system with asynchronous reads when using Veeam Availability Suite 9.5. Agentless Application Aware Backup – Across multiple applications, such as Microsoft Active Directory, Exchange, SharePoint, SQL Server and Oracle. Storage Replication – Customers can now replicate Cisco HyperFlex workloads to another HyperFlex System or to any other VMware vSphere environment including Veeam Cloud and Service Providers by using Veeam’s VM Replication functionality. Veritas Technologies has a partnership with Fujitsu to sell Veritas NetBackup Appliances. Fujitsu is one of Veritas’ largest Global Strategic Partners. Veritas NetBackup Appliances will be offered alongside the existing Fujitsu ETERNUS range of hardware, and this availability of NetBackup alongside Fujitsu’s ETERNUS hardware range strengthens their alliance. Two appliances are mentioned; NetBackup 5240: A versatile, cost-optimised, integrated backup appliance that can be deployed as a master server, media server or both. NetBackup 5330: A performance-optimised, integrated backup media server with high-density storage to support greater performance, capacity and resiliency in the enterprise.

Enter Amazon’s Echo, a voice-driven computer that answers to the name of Alexa, which can recite life-saving instructions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a skill taught to it by the American Heart Association. Alexa is accumulating other health-care skills, too, including acting as a companion for the elderly and answering questions about children’s illnesses. In the near future she will probably help doctors with grubby hands to take notes and to request scans, as well as remind patients to take their pills. Alexa is one manifestation of a drive to disrupt an industry that has so far largely failed to deliver on the potential of digital information. Health care is over-regulated and expensive to innovate in, and has a history of failing to implement ambitious IT projects. But the momentum towards a digital future is gathering pace. Investment into digital health care has soared (see chart). One reason for that is the scale of potential cost-savings. Last year Americans spent an amount equivalent to about 18% of GDP on health care. That is an extreme, but other countries face rising cost pressures from health spending as populations age. Much of this expenditure is inefficient. Spending on administration varies sevenfold between rich countries. There are huge differences in the cost of medical procedures. In rich countries about one-fifth of spending on health care goes to waste, for example on wrong or unnecessary treatments. Eliminating a fraction of this sum is a huge opportunity. Consumers seem readier to accept digital products than just a few years ago. The field includes mobile apps, telemedicine—health care provided using electronic communications—and predictive analytics (using statistical methods to sift data on outcomes for patients). Other areas are automated diagnoses and wearable sensors to measure things like blood pressure. If there is to be a health-care revolution, it will create winners and losers. Andy Richards, an investor in digital health, argues that three groups are fighting a war for control of the “health-care value chain”. One group comprises “traditional innovators”—pharmaceutical firms, hospitals and medical-technology companies such as GE Healthcare, Siemens, Medtronic and Philips. A second category is made up of “incumbent players”, which include health insurers, pharmacy-benefit managers (which buy drugs in bulk), and as single-payer health-care systems such as Britain’s NHS. The third group are the technology “insurgents”, including Google, Apple, Amazon and a host of hungry entrepreneurs that are creating apps, predictive-diagnostics systems and new devices. These firms may well profit most handsomely from the shift to digital. The threat to the traditional innovators is that as medical records are digitised and new kinds of patient data arrive from genomic sequencing, sensors and even from social media, insurers and governments can get much better insight into which treatments work. These buyers are increasingly demanding “value-based” reimbursement—meaning that if a drug or device doesn’t function well, it will not be bought. The big question is whether drug companies will be big losers, says Marc Sluijs, an adviser on investment in digital health. More data will not only identify those drugs that do not work. Digital health care will also give rise to new services that might involve taking no drugs at all. Lunches eaten Diabetes is an obvious problem for the pharma business in this regard, says Dan Mahony, a partner at Polar Capital, an investment firm. Since evidence shows that exercise gives diabetics better control of their disease (and helps most pre-diabetics not to get sick at all), there is an opening for new services. UnitedHealthcare, a big American insurer, for example, has a prevention programme that connects pre-diabetics with special coaches at gyms. An app or a wearable device that persuades people to walk a certain distance every day would be far cheaper for insurers and governments to provide than years of visits to doctors, hospitals and drugs. Although Fitbits are frequently derided for ending up in the back of a drawer, people can be motivated to get off the sofa. Players of Pokémon Go have collectively walked nearly 9bn kilometres since the smartphone game was released last year. That is the backdrop to a new firm called Onduo, a joint venture that Google’s health-care venture, Verily Life Sciences, and Sanofi, a French drug firm, set up last year. Onduo will start by developing ways to help diabetics make better decisions about their use of drugs and their lifestyle habits. Later on, Onduo wants to help those who are at risk of diabetes not to develop it. The startup is a good hedge for Sanofi, which faces a slowdown in sales of its blockbuster insulin medication, Lantus, which lost patent protection in 2015. This kind of thinking does not come easily to drug firms. Switzerland’s Novartis is one of the few to have acknowledged that digital innovation will mean selling products based on patient outcomes. But if pharma firms do not design solutions that put the patient, rather than drug sales, at the centre of their strategy, they risk losing relevance, says Mr Sluijs. Large hospitals, some of which count as both incumbents and traditional innovators, will also be affected. The rise of telemedicine, predictive analytics and earlier diagnoses of illnesses are expected to reduce admissions, particularly of the emergency kind that are most lucrative in commercial systems. The sickest patients can be targeted by specialist services, such as Evolution Health, a firm in Texas that cares for 2m of the most-ill patients across 15 states. It claims to be able to reduce the use of emergency rooms by a fifth, and inpatient stays in hospitals by two-fifths. Rapid medical and diagnostic innovation will disrupt all businesses that rely heavily on physical facilities and staff. A mobile ultrasound scanner made by Philips, called Lumify, means that a far larger number of patients can be seen by their own doctors. As for data-based diagnostics, one potential example of its power to change business models is Guardant Health, a startup that is analysing large quantities of medical data in order to develop a way of diagnosing cancer from blood tests. If the firm can devise an early test for breast cancer, demand for mammograms and the machines that take them would fall, along with the need for expensive drugs and spells in hospital. From ER to AI There is also good news for hospitals, however. Increasingly, machine-learning programs are able to make diagnoses from scans and from test results. An intriguing recent project has been to stream and analyse live health data and deliver alerts on an app that is carried around by doctors and nurses at the Royal Free Hospital in London. The app, which is the work of DeepMind, a British artificial-intelligence (AI) research firm owned by Google, identifies the patients at greatest risk of a sudden and fatal loss of kidney function. The Royal Free says that the app is already saving nurses’ time. Naturally enough, the health-care entrepreneurs have the boldest visions. The point of care will move rapidly into the home, they say. People will monitor their heart conditions, detect concussions, monitor the progress of diseases and check up on moles or ear infections using apps, mobile phones and sensors. Last year the FDA approved 36 connected health apps and devices. A new app, called Natural Cycles, was recently approved in Europe for use as a contraceptive. Its failure rate for typical use was equivalent to that of popular contraceptive pills. A smartphone may eventually be able to predict the onset of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or even the menopause (if the information is wanted). In emerging economies, where regulations on health data are less onerous and where people often already expect to pay to see a doctor, there is faster growth and innovation. China, which is building 400 hospitals a year, saw its two largest VC investments in digital health care last year. One went into a Chinese medical-service app, Ping An Good Doctor, which raised $500m; a video-consultations app called Chunyu Yisheng raised $183m. India is another innovator. To take one example, LiveHealth, based in Pune, is an app that lets patients assemble all their health records in one place, see test results and communicate with doctors. In the short term, the greatest disruption will come from a growing array of apps in many countries around the world that give consumers direct access to qualified GPS on their mobile phones. Overall, telemedicine is expected to grow rapidly. In America, GPs will conduct 5.4m video consultations a year by 2020, says IHS Markit, a research firm. Britain’s NHS is testing a medical AI from a London-based startup called Babylon which can field patients’ questions about their health. A paid service called Push Doctor offers an online appointment almost immediately for £20 ($24). The firm maximises the efficiency of its doctors by reducing the time they spend on administrative duties. They spend 93% of their time with patients compared with only 61% in Britain’s public sector. Babylon reckons that 85% of consultations do not need to be in person. In the longer term, the biggest upheaval may come from the large technology firms. Amazon and Google are not the only giants to be stalking health care. Apple has expressed a strong interest in it, though it is taking time to decide exactly what it wants to do. For several years it has provided a way of bringing together health data on its iPhone, and tools for health researchers to build apps. As personal-health records accumulate on its platform, from sensors such as Fitbits to medical-grade devices, it will encourage more app development. An app using data from an iPhone or another smartphone might be able to warn users that a sedentary lifestyle will exacerbate a heart condition or that, based on social-media patterns, they are at risk of depression, for example. Apple and other tech firms may also be able to help patients take greater control of their existing health records. For now medical records mostly remain under the guard of those who provided the care, but this is expected to change. If patients do gain proper access to their own data, Apple is in a particularly strong position. Its platform is locked and fairly secure, and the apps that run on it are all screened by the firm. None of this will materialise quickly. Regulated health-care systems will take time to deal with concerns over accuracy, security and privacy. In Britain the Royal Free is already under scrutiny over how it shared its patients’ data. That suggests a broader worry: that technology companies are too cavalier with their users’ data. Such firms typically use long agreements on data rights that are hard for individuals to understand. The medical world places importance on informed consent, so a clash of cultures seems unavoidable. Yet enormous change looks inevitable. Investors hope for billion-dollar health-tech “unicorns”. Payers eye equally sizeable savings. Amid such talk it is worth remembering that the biggest winners from digital health care will be the patients who receive better treatment, and those who avoid becoming patients at all.

"There is an annual rhythm in the industry,” Osterloh said. “So, you can count on us to follow it.” Google’s hardware head wouldn’t give a more specific timetable for the new Pixel beyond sometime this year. "You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now,” he said. While we had expected that Google would be continuing the Pixel line, this is the first official confirmation that we’ll be seeing a new model this year. As for the phone’s price, it doesn’t seem that Google has any plans to make a budget version. Per Osterloh: "Pixel stays premium.” Of course, launching a new Pixel phone is all well and good. But hopefully in addition to developing its next major smartphone, Google’s also working on figuring out how to actually ship the current generation of Pixels it already sells.

By Freia Lobo2017-03-03 17:14:33 UTC Google Photos, the company's much-loved photo storage app, is introducing yet another way to improve your snapshots without any hassle.  The company announced a new "auto white balance" feature on Thursday. Now, when users select a filter, the Google Photos app will correct the white balance in an image in addition to the exposure and saturation. Users can tweak things further by going into "Color" and adjusting the warmth and tint.  SEE ALSO: Google Pixel 2 might make you ditch your real camera once and for all Simply put, white balance is a tool used to render colors correctly. Sometimes due to lighting, photos can turn out too yellow, as in the example bellow, or eerily blue. Auto white balance is a staple feature of most cameras and photo-editing tools, and it helps your pictures look better and more natural.  Before Auto White Balance Image: google After Auto White Balance Image: Google Google has been steadily added useful updates to Google Photos since its launch a couple years ago—most recently integrating smart albums and a tool called PhotoScan to digitize old Photos.  The product's main draw is its incredible search feature, which allows users to look for images not only by basic criteria like date and time but also using advanced filters like faces of specific people and simple objects or settings, like "beach" or "watermelon."  Photos is one of Google's best products in recent memory. The company has used its years of research in search, image recognition and machine learning to make a product that is Google at its best—simple and reliable. Auto white balance is rolling out this week to the Android and web apps and will be coming to iOS soon.  BONUS: Our picks for the top 10 best film performances in cinema history   Topics: Google, Google Photos, Photography, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

On Monday, Musk announced that his space exploration company, SpaceX, had agreed to the trip for 'two private citizens', scheduled for the end of 2018.  The trip will send the passengers around the moon's orbit and propel them back to Earth, but won't land on the moon. The voyaging vessel, SpaceX's Dragon 2, will be remote controlled, but the tourists will undergo emergency situation training. 'They have already paid a significant deposit to do a moon mission. Like the Apollo astronauts before them, these individuals will travel into space carrying the hopes and dreams of all humankind, driven by the universal human spirit of exploration,' the tech mogul said.  On Monday, tech mogul Elon Musk (above) announced that his space exploration company, SpaceX, had agreed to send two 'private citizens' to the moon, scheduled for the end of 2018 The travellers for now remain anonymous but Musk said he would release their names at a later date. Above, a SpaceX Falcon9 rocket blasts off February 19, from the Kennedy Space Center The trip will send the passengers around the moon's orbit but won't land on the moon. The voyaging vessel, SpaceX's Dragon 2, will be remote controlled and the tourists will undergo emergency training. Above, a SpaceX processing building at the Kennedy Space Center 'This presents an opportunity for humans to return to deep space for the first time in 45 years and they will travel faster and further into the Solar System than any before them.' The travelers for now remain anonymous; Musk said he would release their names at a later date if they approved. DailyMail.com has spoken with aerospace experts and space veterans and assembled a list of space enthusiasts who have the passion – and the considerable passage, estimated by one expert in the region of $100 million – to make the cut. Dennis Tito, the pioneer of space tourism who was the first private citizen to fund his own trip, shared a glimpse of what SpaceX passengers can expect. He told DailyMail.com: 'I wanted to fly in space since the early 60s and set a goal that I would eventually do it. Finally I had the opportunity 40 years later but it was well worth waiting for because it was just euphoric and the best eight days I've ever spent in my entire life.' Tito ruled himself out as a SpaceX passenger.  Two-time private astronaut and tech billionaire, Charles Simonyi, told DailyMail.com that he 'had some suspicions' on potential passengers and said that Musk had set himself 'an incredibly audacious goal.' 'I have the greatest respect for his talent and for audacity in general. I really wish him the best success in what he's doing,' Simonyi said. Adventurer Per Wimmer, who is signed up for three upcoming trips to space including on Virgin Galactic - but not SpaceX - said SpaceX's program and 2018 launch date was 'ambitious'. 'When it comes to space, it always takes longer and costs more than you initially think,' he told DailyMail.com Wimmer said he was sure that Musk, who he knows personally, would achieve the goal due to his reputation in 'disruptive technology' and the huge amount of capital he has raised to innovate the aerospace industry. 'I'm sure Elon will execute the mission, if not exactly within the timescale but I wish him all the best,' he said. 'He's got the vision, he works incredibly hard and he surrounds himself with clever people who can do clever things.' MOON SHOT: LIKELY SUSPECTS  The female space veteran: Anousheh Ansari The engineer and entrepreneur was the fourth self-funded explorer to visit space in 2006 - her ticket cost $20 million-plus.  Iranian-American Ansari, 50, and her family sponsor an X Prize – a $10 million reward for the first commercial company to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into space twice in two weeks.  Engineer and entrepreneur Anousheh Ansari was the fourth self-funded explorer to visit space in 2006. On Sunday, Ansari accepted the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film on behalf of Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi, who boycotted the ceremony She previously told Forbes: 'As a successful entrepreneur, it would have been easy for me to stay safely in my comfort zone rather than putting my reputation on the line by venturing into the risky business of space travel. However, I believe that taking risks are at the core of achieving a big dream or anything of significance, so this was no different in my mind.' On Sunday, Ansari accepted the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for 'The Salesman' on behalf of Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi, who boycotted the ceremony over President Trump's travel ban. Incidentally, Elon Musk also attended Sunday's Academy Awards. She did not respond to a request for comment by DailyMail.com. The young tech mogul: Mark Shuttleworth Mark Shuttleworth is South African-born and made his Internet millions at a young age. He became the second space tourist in 2002 in his late twenties and paid around $20 million Like Musk, 43-year-old Shuttleworth is South African-born and made his Internet millions at a young age.  Shuttleworth founded Thawte Consulting in 1995, a company which specializes in digital certificates and Internet security. In December 1999, Thawte was acquired by VeriSign, earning Shuttleworth about $575 million.  He became the second space tourist in 2002 in his late twenties (he paid around $20m) and during the voyage spoke to Nelson Mandela.  He did not respond when asked via email if he would take part in the SpaceX mission.   The 'rocket man': Steve Jurvetson Steve Jurvetson, 49, is a renowned venture capitalist who has invested widely in the space industry. He is on the board of SpaceX and Planet Labs, which builds satellites A renowned venture capitalist, the 49-year-old has invested widely in the space industry.  He is on the board of SpaceX and Planet Labs, which builds satellites.  Jurvetson celebrated SpaceX's announcement on Monday by tweeting a picture of the company's spacecraft, the Dragon, with the message: 'How to train your Dragon 2. Dream BIG.' Being a pioneer is not new to him – he was the first person in the world to own a Tesla electric car. He did not respond to a request for comment. The dreamer: Naveen Jain Naveen Jain, 57, is a space fanatic and founded Moon Express, which aims to become the first moon mining company to extract precious resources for use on Eart The internet entrepreneur, 57, is a space fanatic and founded Moon Express, which wants to become the first moon mining company to extract precious resources for use on Earth. Last year he told CNBC: 'If you want to make an impact, you have to dream big, even if people think you're crazy. As an entrepreneur, you never fail; you pivot. If you are shooting for the moon, you probably can actually land on it and solve problems.' The night before Musk's big announcement, Jain tweeted a picture of spaceman floating over the earth with one of his own motivational quotes: 'Walk away from people who laugh at your ambitions.' He added: 'Nothing is more destructive to success than limiting beliefs. #mondaymotivation'. Jain did not respond to DailyMail.com. The space visionary: Peter Diamandis Peter Diamandis, 55, is a Bronx-born doctor and entrepreneur who has been educating people on space since he learned of the Apollo missions as a young boy. He is a co-founder and leader of a number of space innovators The Bronx-born doctor and entrepreneur, 55, has been educating people on space since he learned of the Apollo missions as a young boy and has long dreamed of becoming an astronaut. For years, he has been at the forefront of space exploration and discovery. He founded the X Prize Foundation – a non-profit which has the grand goal of giving multi-million-dollar rewards to breakthroughs that 'pushes the limits of what's possible — to change the world for the better'. He is a co-founder and leader of a number of space innovators including Space Adventures, the Rocket Racing League, Planetary Resources and the International Space University. He also wants to help humans live to 150 years old with his company, Human Longevity. Diamandis did not respond to request for comment. The 'enlightened' competitor for richest man on earth: Google's Sergey Brin Google's Sergey Brin is estimated to be one of the world's richest people with $40 billion wealth. In 2008, he invested $5m in Space Adventures as a deposit for future flights on the Soyuz space shuttle, which had carried previous space tourists From a young age, Brin knew of space travel: his mother worked as a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Brin, now 43, entered Silicon Valley folklore after founding Google in a garage in his mid-twenties with college friend Larry Page.  He is estimated to be one of the world's richest people with $40 billion wealth. He was once called 'Enlightenment Man' by The Economist because of his belief that 'knowledge is always good'. In 2008, he invested $5m in Space Adventures as a deposit for future flights on the Soyuz space shuttle, which had carried previous space tourists. At the time, he told the New York Times: 'I am a big believer in the exploration and commercial development of the space frontier, and am looking forward to the possibility of going into space.' The Soyuz trips were postponed before Brin had a chance to go. Google did not respond to comment. The risk-taking director: James Cameron Director James Cameron, 62, has set tongues wagging in the space community as a possible moon voyager due to his other challenging explorations Although Musk ruled out Hollywood, James Cameron has set tongues wagging in the space community as a possible moon voyager due to his other challenging explorations – including reaching the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean in Deepsea Challenger five years ago. (He is the first person to do it solo and only the third in history.) The Canadian billionaire, 62, has long expressed a fascination with space – both in his movies and with real-life projects. He sits on the advisory board of Planetary Resources, a company which plans to mine asteroids for precious minerals, where investors include Virgin's Richard Branson, Alphabet's Eric Schmidt and Larry Page, and Microsoft alum Charles Simonyi. A rep for Cameron responded to a DailyMail.com interview request: 'Thank you but he isn't available to participate.' The founder: Elon Musk himself Although the 45-year-old billionaire said in a prepared statement that two private citizens had approached him about the mission, it hasn't stopped fans breathlessly speculating it could be Musk himself. Musk, who has recently met with President Trump a number of times, shares a similar vision to the president in terms of commercial partnership with public agencies, such as NASA. DailyMail.com reached out to SpaceX for comment. Staying grounded (for now, at least).  These space enthusiasts have confirmed to DailyMail.com that they won't be on the SpaceX flight The pioneer: Dennis Tito Dennis Tito is a wealthy American engineer and entrepreneur who was the first citizen to fund his own trip into space. The wealthy American engineer and entrepreneur was the first citizen to fund his own trip into space.  He spent almost eight days on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2001, paying an estimated $20 million and using the time to perform scientific experiments. Now 76, Tito told DailyMail.com he was not one of the SpaceX two – and said he had no insider knowledge on who it could be, adding it would 'require someone of means and with a real interest in space'. He said: 'I think it would be a wonderful experience. I'm really excited to hear that this is going to take place in the near future.' The frequent-flier: Tech billionaire Charles Simonyi Charles Simonyi, an early pioneer at Microsoft with Bill Gates who is credited with its Office program, has been to space not once - but twice. Dr. Charles Simonyi, an early pioneer at Microsoft with Bill Gates who is credited with its Office program, has been to space not once - twice - but says he is 'done with space tourism' Each trip was two weeks long - with two days on the Russian spacecraft, Soyuz, and the rest of the time on the International Space Station (ISS). He made the trips in 2007 and 2009, spending an estimated $25m and $35m respectively. 'I went up on one spacecraft with one crew and came down on a different spacecraft with a different crew. So altogether I've been flying with ten different astronauts on five different spacecrafts,' Simonyi said. The 68-year-old software architect said he was not one of the SpaceX passengers. 'No – I'm done with space tourism,' he told DailyMail.com. 'I have to work and I have two small kids to spend time with.' The invested adventurer: Per Wimmer Per Wimmer ruled himself out of the SpaceX trip but told DailyMail.com that he 'wished' he was going. Financier and philanthropist Per Wimmer, a friend of Elon Musk, ruled himself out of the SpaceX trip but told DailyMail.com that he 'wished' he was going The financier and philanthropist, who is a friend of Elon Musk, bought his first ticket to space 17 years ago.  Wimmer, 49, has completed the rigorous training program and is already signed up for three trips: he is a founding astronaut with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic; astronaut 'Number 1' for the XCOR Lynx space craft and holds a seat with Space Adventures. He told DailyMail.com: 'I'm a serial committer in that regard but it's not me on this occasion.' He estimated that a seat on the Dragon 2 spacecraft would cost about $100 million. Wimmer said although he did not know who the two private passengers were it would likely be revealed on the 'space grapevine'.  'It's a very small market but I think two people have called Elon – I don't think he was in the market of selling around the moon trips. 'I think he's very busy with cargo trips to the ISS and the manned flights. I don't think everything has been fleshed out yet.' Wimmer said he hoped to make it to space in around 18 months. 'I am one of the first ones to go on the Galactic and that program is moving forward very nicely. I am the number one astronaut on XCOR and I don't think that call is a million miles away. I'll probably fly on Galactic before the round-the-moon trip happens.' He added: 'Not that there's any competition, we're all friends in the space business.' The second generation astronaut: Richard Garriott Video game developer Richard Garriott was the sixth space tourist in 2008, paying an estimated $30 million for the privilege. Video game developer Garriott was the sixth space tourist in 2008, paying an estimated $30 million for the privilege. Along with being credited with creating the term 'avatar', he is also behind a number of blockbuster games including fantasy role-playing game, Ultima Series.  A founding member of Space Adventures, Garriott's father was a NASA astronaut (making him the only second-generation astronaut). However Garriott ruled himself out, tweeting hours after the Space X announcement: 'Not me... yet!' Hollywood Stars During a teleconference on Monday, Elon Musk ruled out any celebrities, saying curtly: 'It's no one from Hollywood.' Among the celebrities who hold $250,000 tickets on Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic are Leonardo DiCaprio, Ashton Kutcher, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks and Lady Gaga.

Elon Musk did not divulge the cost of a seat on the private SpaceX moon trip but said his company had accepted a 'significant deposit'. Private astronaut Per Wimmer, who has two decades of experience in the space industry, told DailyMail.com: 'I think it will be not far from $100 million – knowing what it takes rocket-wise, the trajectory and also building in a profit margin.' A ride on the Soyuz spacecraft – as far as the ISS, 250 miles above earth – costs upwards of $70 million. 'To go around the moon and back is about 300,000-400,000 miles but it doesn't cost much more because once you're out of the earth's atmosphere, you don't need a lot of energy to keep going. That first 1km is the most expensive,' said Wimmer. ARE THERE HEALTH RISKS? Musk said on Monday that he expected health and fitness tests for the moon trip to begin in late 2017. Wimmer explained the two aspects of space travel which take the greatest toll on the body. 'It's recommended to get your body used to G-force exposure and the weightless environment. 'When you launch, it's a minimum G-force of X - the equivalent of lying down and having six people standing on top of you. When you put yourself in a weightless environment – it's very strange on your balance and can play tricks on your mind.' He said that doctors can mitigate for a lot of minor health problems but there were like to be two major health concerns that would prevent you from going into space. Private astronaut Per Wimmer, who has two decades of experience in the space industry, told DailyMail.com: 'I think it [the SpaceX moon trip] will be not far from $100 million – knowing what it takes rocket-wise, the trajectory and also building in a profit margin'. Above, Wimmer shows his ticket for space traveling after a press conference in California in 2008 'You get a lot of G-Force pressure to your back, so if you have a problem there, that's tricky,' he said. 'Because of the pressure, adrenaline and all the excitement, if you have a weak heart or a heart condition, I wouldn't recommend it. It's a lot of strain on the body.' He added: 'They have got to make sure your body is in good condition and there's no big hiccups that can happen. So a rigorous medical is also important. 'You also do normal exercise, eat well and don't drink. There's not many things that can rule you out as long as you listen to the doctor and complete your training. WHAT TRAINING IS INVOLVED? There are three elements – human centrifuge training, preparation for weightlessness and flying at high altitudes and high speed. CENTRIFUGE - Wimmer explained: 'You go round and round in circles, creating G-Force exposure to the body. It completely simulates a rocket launch. It's not for people who are claustrophobic but it's very useful. THE 'VOMIT COMET' - Trainee astronauts are flown in a jumbo jet to an altitude of 14km - then the plane makes more than a dozen 'passes' – accelerating towards the ground – to reach a low altitude. This technique creates 30-40 seconds of weightlessness. When the plane reaches 6km, the pilot goes back up again. 'During a training session, they do about 16 passes and have 15 people on board. There's always a few throwing up in the corner,' Wimmer said. FIGHTER JET TRAINING - Fighter jets fly at Mach 3, three times the speed of sound. They reach altitudes of 80,000ft at which point you can see the curvature of the earth. Wimmer said: 'We fly fast and high but also a bit lower to do acrobatics, which exposes your body to G-Force. Its excellent training as it teaches you how to react and your body's limits in terms of pressure.' HOW LONG DOES TRAINING TAKE? It's dependent on the type of flight. Wimmer said: 'For suborbital flights training usually takes one or two weeks because it's a relatively short flight - you're up and back in the same day. 'When it comes to around the moon, it gets a little more complex. The best example would be the Soviets' program. They typically spend four months in Star City (the Cosmonaut training center in Moscow). RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Touchdown! The incredible moment Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket...

Share this article Share 25 shares 'For the SpaceX trip, the training will probably be somewhere between those two time periods. Elon will probably condense it down to what really matters and make a fairly efficient program. Two-time private astronaut, Charles Simonyi, also shared the knowledge of his training for space. He told DailyMail.com: 'I trained for eight months for the first flight. I only had to do three months [for the second flight] because they accepted the results of the first training. The Soyuz is a very old-fashioned spacecraft and it's really not built for ease of use. I'm sure that the amount of training for the Dragon will be much less. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO GO INTO SPACE? The first ever self-funded space tourist, Dennis Tito, told DailyMail.com that his experience in space made him feel 'euphoric'. He added: 'I expect that the two individuals who will fly to the moon, or the vicinity of the moon, will have also a glorious experience and I would think an even greater experience because of being so far from earth.' Simonyi said he had been more deeply affected by the training program than the flight. The first ever self-funded space tourist, Dennis Tito, told DailyMail.com that his experience in space made him feel 'euphoric'. Above, Tito in space in 2001 He said: 'The flight was an intellectual exercise - seeing for real what the training made me understand. There were no surprises during the flight because the training was so good, with lots of simulations. I'm also a pilot and the good thing about simulators is you typically practice for emergencies that don't happen on real flights – the same thing with space. In a way, the training gave a greater range of experiences than the flight itself. He added: 'Though we did have few small failures during the flight [to space]. My crewmates and I had a chuckle because one failure was what we practised for on our final exam on the ground.' WHAT DOES SPACE LOOK LIKE? Simonyi said: 'It's an amazing expanse and it's not unlike flying on an aircraft. Obviously you're a little higher but not extremely so. You don't see the whole of the earth from low orbit where the space station is flying. Two-time private astronaut Dr. Charles Simonyi said he had been more deeply affected by the training program than the flight itself. 'The flight was an intellectual exercise - seeing for real what the training made me understand,' he said. Above, Simonyi rests shortly after landing from his space trip in 2009 'The ISS is 250 miles above the surface – the distance between New York and Boston. You see one or two states, a few countries in Europe but not much more than that.' WHAT DO YOU DO IN SPACE? Simonyi said: 'I volunteered for as many experiments as they were willing to trust me with. Many of these experiments are fairly simply but the professional astronauts only have so much time. For the European Space Agency I did a sample experiment, taking biological swabs of various prescribed parts of the space station to see if any bacteria are living there. They were returned to Earth to be analysed. 'Other experiments were as simple as giving blood before and after the flight.

Previously, users had to hack things or wait for developers to customize their Android app for use on a Chromebook, but Google announced earlier this year that they would put the Google Play Store on ChromeOS. We’ll show users how to install Android apps on Chromebook if their Chromebook supports it. This will include changing from the stable release channel of ChromeOS to the developer’s channel. That means users will start running a ChromeOS version that might include some glitches and bugs. However, it also offers new features not available to most users, like the Google Play Store. If you use your Chromebook for work or school and can’t afford bugs and glitches, then you should wait until Google makes it available on your Chromebook. Google started with the ASUS Chromebook Flip. The Google Chromebook Pixel and Acer Chromebook R11 got it next in mid-July. The rest of most modern Chromebooks made in the last year will eventually get it. If your Chromebook can run build number 53.0.2768.0, the first version that includes the Play Store, then you can follow the steps below to get it early. How do you know if yours will work? Here’s the list of now supported devices that will get the Google Play Store this year. Unfortunately, that list is only for those that can run the Google Play Store in the stable build of ChromeOS. More Chromebooks will let you install Android apps if you run ChromeOS in the beta or developer builds. The list of Chromebooks that support the Google Play Store on developer or beta channels changes quickly. Head over to the Google+ Chromebooks community to find out if your Chromebook will support Android apps. How to Install Android Apps on Chromebook Go to the ChromeOS settings by clicking on the icon in the lower right corner of the screen at the right end of the Shelf. It will look like your Google account avatar. Then click on Settings (see above). At the top of the window that opens up, there’s a link that reads About ChromeOS. Click it. Look for a link in the middle of the box that opens that reads More Info…. The box expands and shows a button that reads Change Channel. Click it and then click on Developer – unstable and then click on the button that appears asking to restart the system. The computer will restart and install the update. When the computer restarts, log in and the Google Play Store will pop up and ask the user to Agree to the user agreement. Click the Agree button and then click on SIGN IN on the next screen. The Google Play Store asks you to accept another agreement. Click on ACCEPT. The Google Play Store now runs on your Chromebook. To install apps find an app you want to install. For example, we’ll install Microsoft Excel. Search for it in the search box. The app will show up in a grid of apps that the search finds. Click on the app’s thumbnail and then click on the INSTALL button. The app will install. Once it’s finished click on OPEN to run it for the first time. Android apps that you install on a Chromebook show up in the  Launcher. Click on the search icon at the left end of the ChromeOS Shelf. You can search for the app title or click on the All Apps box. This opens another box with all the Chrome Web Apps and Android Apps that you’ve installed on the device. Most likely the Android apps will show up on the rightmost screen. Click on the rightmost blue line at the bottom of the box of app icons or use the arrow keys to scroll to the right. If you want quicker access to the Android apps you install on the Chromebook, right-click on an app icon and choose Pin to Shelf in the menu that pops up. How Well Do Android Apps Run on a Chromebook? So far, most of the Android apps I installed on my Chromebook work well. One of my apps is a book viewer and lets me view two different books at a time. The control that opens the split screen view sits in the bottom right corner. The ChromeOS Shelf covers this control and I had to set it to Autohide so that the Shelf would disappear. The Share feature doesn’t work properly in one app. I tapped the Share button and it came up with a Share via… button. Usually, I tap on this button and it gives me a list of apps I can use to share the photo. On the Chromebook, it does nothing since the Share via feature doesn’t work in ChromeOS. Other than these two minor issues, all the ChromeOS apps I’ve installed work well. It opens a new world to Chromebook users.   8 Responses 06/27/2016 T.

Open-source. Suitable for government and other security-conscious offices. The only desktop suite available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Can open and convert almost any legacy document or worksheet. Cons Less stable and not as good-looking suites from Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Online collaboration requires manual installation by an IT expert on a corporate or office-based server. Some dialogs and options are cramped or incomprehensible. Bottom Line LibreOffice is free and open-source, opens almost any legacy document, and is the only office suite available on all major desktop platforms. What it lacks is the smooth interface and stability of its paid competitors. By Edward Mendelson There are lots of reasons to choose the free LibreOffice 5 as your office suite, and plenty of reasons to choose something else, too. The best reason for choosing it is that it's the only fully up-to-date open-source office suite, meaning that security-conscious users like governments and financial institutions—who are typically leery about proprietary office apps from Microsoft, Google, or Apple—can use LibreOffice in full confidence that everything it does is publicly visible, and that none of their data is slipping surreptitiously into some remote database in the name of enhanced productivity. This review focuses mainly on version 5.3 of LibreOffice for Windows, but I also tested it on the Mac, as I'll explain. //Compare Similar Products Compare Microsoft Office 2016 (for Windows)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corel WordPerfect Office X8   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 365 Home   %displayPrice%%seller% Pages (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Keynote (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Numbers (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Office Mobile for Office 365 Subscribers (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% LibreOffice (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Drive   %displayPrice%%seller% Keynote (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% IBM Lotus Symphony 3.0   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Excel (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft PowerPoint (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Free and Flexible Other reasons for choosing LibreOffice include that it's free; that it's available with an identical interface and feature set in Windows, macOS, and Linux; and that it's one of the few suites that can open and convert almost any legacy document that you or your office may have created over the last three decades. Another attraction is that LibreOffice still uses the familiar toolbar-and-icon menu structure that millions of users learned from older versions of Microsoft Office, but which Microsoft abandoned ten years ago for the new Ribbon interface. As for the reasons to choose something else, I'll get to those later. Office Work LibreOffice combines a word-processor called Writer, a spreadsheet called Calc, a presentations app called Impress, a vector-drawing program called Draw, a database called Base, and a math-formula editor called Math. The newly released version 5.3 retains the old-school interface of earlier versions, but with more features added to the optional sidebar panel and standard shortcut keys like Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V for cutting and pasting visible on the menu and enabled by default. View All 10 Photos in Gallery A new Safe Mode lets you start LibreOffice with a new user profile, disable extensions, or reset the whole configuration. All this is designed to help you fix the suite when it starts crashing regularly—a problem that, in my experience, is more common in the macOS version than the Windows version. (I haven't been able to fix this problem in macOS, but it's more of a time-wasting annoyance than a data-losing disaster because it usually happens when I try to open a file.) The Writer word-processor finally provides a dialog that lets you jump to a specific page number, supports preset table styles, adds a line-drawing toolbar, and enhances color-selection tools and coordinated color themes that more closely match the stylish ones in Microsoft Office. The Calc spreadsheet acts more like Excel, with wildcards rather than regular expressions as the default setting in formulas, enhanced pivot-table dialogs, and a function-selection menu that narrows down your choices as you type. The Impress presentations app, never a strong point, gets some moderately stylish new templates and a new template-selection dialog when Impress opens up, but don't expect anything like the elegant design and gee-whiz animations that Microsoft gives you with PowerPoint and Apple with Keynote. LibreOffice's main rivals are Microsoft Office, Google Docs, Sheet, and Slides, the corporate G Suite, and Apple's Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, formerly marketed as a suite under the name iWork. All these rivals exist in online versions accessible through a web browser or mobile apps, and all support real-time remote collaboration. Microsoft and Apple's apps exist in both desktop and mobile versions; Google's are only online. Until now, LibreOffice, in its full version, was available only for the desktop. Now, it's also available in a browser-accessible LibreOffice Online version, complete with collaborative editing, but only if your IT department installs it for you. There's no publicly available LibreOffice Online, as there is for Microsoft's, Apple's, and Google's apps. LibreOffice's developers have made slow but steady progress into making the sidebar panel into an easy-to-use alternative to the menus and toolbars, and I'm impressed with the current version's spacious, clean design. The LibreOffice sidebar looks a lot like the sidebar in Apple Keynote, Numbers, and Pages but Apple gets things right that LibreOffice doesn't. For example, Apple's page-layout sidebar lets you enter custom settings for all four page margins. LibreOffice's sidebar only lets you choose among preset margin settings, and you need to open a separate dialog to set custom margins. Once you've set custom margins, the sidebar shows Custom as one of the available margin settings—but if you click on Custom, you don't get back to the dialog where you change the settings. Instead, you have to go back to the separate margin-setting dialog. Apple and Microsoft get this kind of thing right in their desktop suites, but keep in mind that you have to pay for those suites while LibreOffice is free. Legacy File Formats I mentioned LibreOffice's compatibility with legacy file formats. This is a major feature for anyone who may have to work with files created decades ago in obsolete word processors or spreadsheets, and LibreOffice far outclasses Microsoft, Google and Apple in this arena. Its closest rival is the Windows-only Corel WordPerfect Office suite, which also opens almost any legacy document, but, oddly, can't open documents created by the last, unofficial release of WordPerfect for the Mac, while LibreOffice can. If you work in a school, office, or lab with legacy documents, LibreOffice is an essential tool even if you don't use it for everyday work. Clunky and Crashy As for reasons to choose something other than LibreOffice, these may be decisive for you as they are for me. First of all, despite improvements, it's clunky to look at and crashes more than it should. You can easily change its ugly default font, the open-source Liberation Serif font, but until you do, no one will be impressed by your documents. The most commonly used menus are clear and spacious, especially the ones in the sidebar pane, but the Options menu is cramped and often incomprehensible unless you've been using LibreOffice for years. Next, until someone funds a publicly accessible version of LibreOffice online—and that's not likely to happen—you can't work with LibreOffice remotely in the way you can with Microsoft, Apple, and Google. Another problem is that some features simply don't work—or at least don't work reliably enough to rely on. The Mac version of LibreOffice typically crashes a few seconds after I import any Word document, though the same documents cause no problems when I import them in LibreOffice's Windows version. On both the Mac and Windows versions, I wasted a lot of time trying to use an option to access "remote files" on Google Drive or OneDrive, but every effort to log in to those drives produced an obscure error message saying "The specified device is invalid." I eventually discovered that I had encountered a known bug that's been left unfixed for a year. This isn't how professional-quality software is supposed to work. When I edit documents in Microsoft Word in Window (or via Word in Office on the Mac), I turn on the feature that hides the top and bottom margins of the page, so that when I type a sentence that begins on one page and ends on another, I don't have to look at two inches of blank space where the page break occurs. LibreOffice has nothing like this, offering only a Web View that doesn't show any page formatting at all. This hide-blank-space feature may not matter to you, but once you get accustomed to it, there's no going back. A Good Backup Suite LibreOffice is an impressive achievement that keeps getting better with its frequent incremental releases, and anyone who has legacy documents lurking on a hard disk ought to have a copy. But unless you have security requirements that demand open-source software, or your organization needs apps that work on Linux as well as on Windows and the Mac, you're likely going to prefer to pay for Microsoft Office or use Apple's or Google's apps instead.

Name: Subject: Message: Google announces new HP Chromebook in blog post about Swedish schools Newsby Scott Adam Gordon4 days ago 5 385 6   Google published a story on its blog yesterday about the role of technology in education; specifically about how Chromebooks are being used in Swedish schools. Buried among the information was news of a new HP Chromebook (and a new contender for worst-named technology product ever): the Chromebook x360 11 G1 Education Edition, built with the classroom in mind. It’s described as a “rugged” 360-degree convertible Chromebook with USB Type-C charging, world-facing camera capabilities and an optional stylus, in keeping with Google’s new generation of Chromebooks. A world-facing camera allows students to capture photos and videos from all directions. Google says these are being positioned near Chromebook keyboards so that, when a Chromebook is flipped, the camera faces outwards and students can hold it like a tablet. See also: Google Pixel 2 confirmed for later this year and it’s staying “premium” 1 day ago The stylus, meanwhile, would likely be one of the low-cost pens Google has described previously. These resemble “#2 pencils with a unique eraser for correcting mistakes and don’t need charging or pairing, so they can be shared and easily replaced if lost.” Chromebooks are a popular choice for classrooms and students because they’re comparatively inexpensive and have a lightweight UI. Commenting on their prevalence, Google said: “Worldwide more than 20 million teachers and students are using Chromebooks and Google Classroom, and more than 70 million are using G Suite for Education.” The Chromebook x360 11 G1 Education Edition will be available from mid-April but price and availability details are yet to be confirmed.

Simple site- and user-management features. Works the same way on all current desktop and mobile platforms. Fine-tuned collaboration and revision-tracking features. Cons No desktop apps. Offline editing is only possible in the Chrome browser and requires downloading files in advance. Less powerful than desktop-based apps. Bottom Line G Suite offers most of the power and flexibility of its main office-suite rival, Microsoft Office 365. Its entirely cloud-based tools can be used from any desktop or mobile platform, but they lack the full power of desktop apps. By Edward Mendelson Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is Google's free-for-everyone online office suite, and it excels at helping users create and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. If you're sharing a small number of documents with only a few colleagues, the free version of this suite is enough. But for corporate, educational, or any other organized, collective operation, you'll want the paid (starting at $5 per user per month) subscription-based versions that Google offers under the name G Suite. //Compare Similar Products Compare Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 365 Home   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Windows)   %displayPrice%%seller% LibreOffice 5   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corel WordPerfect Office X8   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Pages (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Numbers (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Keynote (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% G Suite's Competition G Suite has powerful rivals, including various corporate-level versions of Microsoft Office 365; Apple's set of iCloud-accessible apps, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote (which used to be sold as a suite called iWork); and online collaboration services like Zoho. Even when compared with these productivity titans, G Suite has plenty of advantages, and it gets new and improved features every few weeks. It has limits too, however, as I'll explain, so you need to make sure it strikes the right balance for your needs before committing to it. Getting Started With G Suite I set up a G Suite account through a simple wizard that required me to choose a domain name, either one I already owned, or a new domain that I could create by paying a $12 annual registration fee. I created a new domain, PCMagReviewers.com, and then created e-mail accounts at that address for myself and some colleagues. The setup screen let me send out messages to my colleagues' existing addresses notifying them of the new addresses I had created for them. After that, I signed in at google.com using my new e-mail address, and a menu at the upper right of the window let me access all the G Suite apps. View All 10 Photos in Gallery G Suite offers three versions: Basic, Business, and Enterprise. All include the Google apps and calendar, video and voice conferencing, and management features. The Basic service costs $5 per user per month and gives you a total of 30 GB of cloud storage, shared among users. The Business version costs $10 per user per month and offers unlimited storage, plus archiving, auditing and data-retention features for corporate compliance, and electronic discovery for use when gathering legal evidence. Enterprise plans are priced individually and add advanced security, data-retention, and data-analysis features. Note that business subscriptions to Office 365 also start at $5 per user per month. G Suite's management menus are clear and straightforward, but Microsoft's equivalent menus in corporate versions of Office 365 seem to me easier to navigate and visually more elegant. Apple doesn't offer a corporate-level service comparable to G Suite or Office 365, though the $19.95 macOS Server add-on to macOS provides features for sharing files, calendars, contacts, and mail accounts. G Suite Administration I've been using an enterprise version of G Suite for years through a large organization that I work for, but, for this review, I tested G Suite's Basic service to get an idea of what it's like to administer the suite instead of merely using the setup that an administrator created for me. As in corporate-level versions of Office 365 and Zoho Docs, I used a site-creating wizard to build a website for my new domain, and make it accessible either only to users with addresses at PCMagReviewers.com or to anyone on the web. The Google Sites app that creates these sites has all the elegance and simplicity of Google's other apps, making it effortless to build a multipage site in less than an hour. Google Sites is free for anyone to use, but free users can only create sites with a sites.google.com address, while G Suite subscribers use their own domain name as their site address, just as in any other paid web-hosting service. Office Suite Functionality G Suite's versions of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides offer the same elegant, minimalist-looking templates that you get in the free versions, but G Suite lets you upload your own documents, spreadsheets, or presentations to use as templates for creating new ones. For collaboration and sharing, G Suite offers more options than you get with the free Google apps. For example, you can specify that a document can be shared only with members of your organization, or only members of your organization to whom you've sent a sharing link. As with the free Google office suite, you can specify that changes made to your document by your collaborators appear in color, to indicate that they're suggestions rather than actual edits. These suggestions can be accepted or rejected one by one by clicking on buttons in the comment panel at the right of the window. When you choose G Suite over Office 365 or Apple's apps, you're making a major decision to rely on data and apps that live almost entirely in the cloud, accessible only in a browser or a mobile device. Google doesn't supply desktop apps like the desktop versions of Microsoft Word or Excel or Apple's Pages and Numbers. If you want to edit your documents on a Wi-Fi challenged airplane, you'll need to edit them in Google's Chrome browser via an optional extension. And, before you go offline, you'll need to download every document that you want to edit. I'm not willing to take that kind of trouble every time I risk being somewhere—like a typical Amtrak train—where Wi-Fi may suddenly stop working. Office Suite in the Cloud In contrast with Google's cloud-only apps, Microsoft's and Apple's apps run either on the desktop or in a browser or mobile device, and the desktop apps have the kind of power that no mobile app can offer. Also, Microsoft's OneDrive and Apple's iCloud typically store copies of your documents on your hard disk and also in the cloud, whereas Google stores only links to your documents in the Google Drive folder that you can create on your hard disk. You can download your Google documents to your hard disk but only in formats like Office format or Open Document (LibreOffice) format, not in the Google Docs format itself. I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that my documents live in the cloud in a format that I can't download on my hard disk, but this may not bother you as much as it does me. Cloud-only apps like Google's always have a reduced feature set compared to desktop equivalents, but the vast majority of documents and worksheets don't need any more features than Google provides. The apps in G Suite have Google's typically elegant interface, and I'm impressed with the way Google takes keyboard accessibility seriously. The toolbars and menus display keyboard shortcuts for almost every feature, so you don't need to strain your wrist mousing around the screen as you mostly need to do with Apple's apps. (Microsoft's online Office also offers plenty of keyboard shortcuts.) Editing and Versioning The Google apps keep track of all editing changes that you make on your document, going back to the time it was first created. You can revert to an older version of your Google Slides presentation or simply use the document-history feature to look back at an old version to find and copy text that you want to paste into the current version. Microsoft and Apple both offer a Track Changes option, but you need to remember to turn it on, and it's much more convenient to have it running by default. Apple's apps let you turn on revision tracking in the desktop version, but the online versions of Apple's apps don't support revision tracking at all, which can be a problem. If you use a browser to open a document that has revision tracking switched on, you won't be able to edit it. Another advantage in Google's apps is the Explore pane, which you can open from the menu or a keyboard shortcut. Like Microsoft's Smart Lookup feature, Explore searches the web for relevant information about your document. Unlike Microsoft's feature, however, Google displays a quotation-mark icon next to each of its search hits. Click on this icon, and the reference material is inserted into your document as a footnote. You'll probably need to format and revise the footnote text, but you'll avoid a lot of complicated steps required to add references in any other app. An Excellent Office Suite G Suite has plenty to offer any organization that needs a collaboration-ready office suite, a website, shared calendars, and mail services. Compared with Office 365, which exists on the desktop and in the cloud, G Suite is cloud-only, and that's either an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on your needs. Cloud-only apps are an advantage if you want to assure that everything produced by your organization is always available. They're a disadvantage if you want the full power of desktop apps, or if you need offline access to your files. I'm impressed with the ease, elegance, speed, and depth of G Suite, and if I still prefer to get my work done in Office 365, that's because I need the full power of desktop apps like Microsoft Word for the work I do. If your organization can manage with the relatively lightweight cloud-only apps in G Suite, and you don't mind keeping your documents in Google Drive, G Suite is a superbly powerful and elegant choice and an Editors' Choice winner for business-class cloud-based office suites.

By Rob Thubron on Mar 3, 2017, 11:50 AM 13 comments TechSpot With most companies releasing a new version of their flagship smartphones every year, it was expected that Google would follow the trend by unveiling the Pixel 2 in 2017. At Mobile World Congress, senior vice president of hardware at Google, Rick Osterloh, confirmed there would be new versions of the popular handsets released before year’s end. Speaking to AndroidPit, Osterloh said: “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it […] You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now." As the first Pixel arrived in October 2016, you can expect its successor to launch around the same period this year, which is also the time Apple’s $1000 iPhone 8 is expected. It’ll certainly be interesting to see the two handsets go head-to-head, and both may have to contend with Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 - set for release sometime during the last quarter of 2017. Back in January, there were rumors of another Pixel phone, this one a low-end device designed for emerging markets, being released alongside or just after the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. However, Osterloh stated that “Pixel stays premium,” suggesting there won’t be a budget option available. 9to5Google – responsible for the first report - still believes the company will produce a cheap handset, but it won’t be a Pixel-branded one. Given the popularity of such devices in regions like India, don’t be surprised to see Google bring out a low-end phone purposely for these areas. We still don’t know much about the Pixel 2, other than some pretty obvious expectations: latest Snapdragon SoC, waterproofing, a better camera with multiple features, etc. But expect to find out more over the coming months.

LATER Typo Blamed for Amazon's Internet-Crippling Outage YOU ARE HERE:   HOME MOBILE INDUSTRY NEWS THIS STORY Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Sam Levin. Updated March 3, 2017 8:35AM SHARE ALSO SEE Uber Automotive Gender Discrimination Sexual Harassment Mobile Apps Lawsuit Human Resources Silicon Valley Ellen Pao Haana was so repulsed by what happened to her, she covered up her mirror so she wouldn’t have to look at herself. The Silicon Valley tech worker said that after drinks with startup colleagues last year, a male executive at her company put his hand up her shirt and groped her while they walked down the street. "I felt disgusted for months after that," said Hanna, who requested that the Guardian not include her full name or identify the small tech startup where she used to do marketing. "It affects me on a level that I wish it didn't." According to Haana, the CEO refused to fire him, and she eventually left the business. Her allegations are far from unique in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, in the male-dominated technology industry, female staffers and workers of color say sexual misconduct, discrimination and retaliation are rampant -- and that men in powerful positions are routinely protected while women are often pushed out of their jobs by harassment. Following the recent viral blogpost of Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer who chronicled claims of sexual harassment and mistreatment, the Guardian has found that similar allegations are widespread across the tech sector. According to a number of prominent attorneys, hundreds if not thousands of women and people of color in tech come forward each year with complaints of toxic work environments largely controlled by white men. Under the guise of "disruption" and "innovation," startups and tech corporations skirt employment laws and reject HR practices while sometimes fostering a party culture where young male executives encourage socializing and drinking. Often, founders hire and promote friends and people similar to them. In these settings, women are vulnerable to all kinds of abuse, ranging from lewd comments to unwanted propositions to groping to assault. "The scale is sort of breathtaking," said Kelly Dermody, an attorney who annually assists hundreds of women in tech and represents thousands across class-action lawsuits. "Most of the women I've worked with in startups have had stories where they have been physically touched, if not worse, without their consent.” In recent years, there have been public claims of sexism and discrimination at numerous high-profile technology companies, including Twitter, Apple, Oracle, Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google.

But some say the problem is under-reported and particularly acute in early-stage startups where there are no HR departments. There, young CEOs may choose not to fire or reprimand executives who are college friends they consider vital to the company, and when founders or CEOs commit offenses, it can be impossible for women to find justice. More Like a Fraternity In a recent survey of more than 200 women in tech, 60% said they faced unwanted sexual advances, often from superiors. One in three women said they felt afraid for their personal safety, and 66% said they felt excluded because of their gender. The research was inspired by Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, whose discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sparked national debate about misogyny in Silicon Valley. "Most women have experienced some version of this," Pao, who lost her landmark suit, said in an interview last week. She said she hopes the Uber case is a "watershed moment" that inspires the industry to fix a "fundamentally broken" culture. Therese Lawless, an employment attorney who represented Pao and the female engineer at Tesla, said the impact of the social scene at some of the companies can be extreme. "You have a culture which is more like a fraternity than it is a workplace … Sometimes it ends in disaster," she said. "There's a huge range, from sexual assault to propositions for sex to wanting sexual favors in the workplace to unwanted touching to showing of explicit pictures." When young startups grow their businesses at very rapid rates, they fail to properly invest in HR, said Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer with Outten and Golden, the nation's largest firm representing workers in claims against employers. "You have this insular group of like-minded and similar-looking people who are suddenly given immense privilege and opportunity and wealth. And before long, they can feel like they are above the law." Amélie Lamont, a former employee of Squarespace, the popular website design company, said that she felt obligated to go to bars with colleagues for regular hangouts. "If you weren't drinking, you weren't a part of the culture. That was frustrating," said Lamont, who last year published an account of facing racism and sexism as a black female supervisor at Squarespace. "That was really hard keeping up … If you skipped them, it meant you weren't really connecting with your coworkers. You weren't building a strong relationship." Haana, who is in her 20s and has worked for multiple startups, said she has had a close relationship with the CEO of her previous company for years. She said the chief technology officer groped her and that he was friends with the CEO. This kind of intimate nature of an early stage startup makes it challenging to deal with these kinds of conflicts, she said. "When you're involved in a startup, you kind of need to be involved in each other's lives," Haana explained. "You live, you eat, you work together." That made it all the more painful, she said, that no one seemed to take her concerns seriously. "What can I say to make people believe it wasn't my fault?" she said, noting that the incident had a long-term impact on her. "It's something that's a part of me, and I have to figure out how to deal with it. I don't know how to get rid of that anxiety." In phone interviews, the CEO said he didn't think automatically terminating the CTO was an appropriate response, and the CTO denied that he groped Haana but said it's possible she "misinterpreted” a "hug." Pao said the tight-knit nature of startups can make the experience of harassment all the more painful. "If you're not part of that group of founding friends, you're excluded. And that exclusion can take on many forms." 'They Were Going Out of Their Way To Try To Sabotage Her Work' While many victims of discrimination or harassment choose not to file legal complaints or go public, the ones who do speak out face serious risks. Days after her post about Uber, Fowler tweeted that people she knows were being asked for "personal and intimate" information about her as part of what seems to be a "smear campaign." Uber claimed it was not behind the investigation. The company also hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate harassment and vowed to hold offenders accountable. After Lamont, 28, went public about the prejudice and misogyny she said she faced at Squarespace, she faced an onslaught of nasty comments and harassing messages, with some branding her a liar and others lecturing her about how black women should behave. Lamont, who now works as a product design lead at the New York Times, said she was one of a very small handful of black women at Squarespace and that she felt white managers and executives didn't understand her experience. "I felt devalued," she said. "Even going into other jobs, I carried all the baggage." Squarespace did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After she published her post, Lamont said many women of color in tech reached out to share similar stories: "That was validating." One black woman told her about a manager who said she shouldn't wear her hair naturally in an afro or braids because she appeared "too ethnic." Another woman told her she was repeatedly given grunt work that didn't match her level of expertise. Jennifer Schwartz, another Outten and Golden lawyer, said she has represented a number of transgender women in tech who "face shocking and blatant discrimination and impropriety in all forms," including jokes like, "Have you decided today whether you're a man or a woman?" Schwratz said that for one trans female programmer she represented at a successful startup was "consistently marginalized," with men excluding her from meetings and ignoring her successes. "They were going out of their way to try to sabotage her work, creating a sort of clubbiness where the men were patting each other on the back for denigrating her." The woman, Schwartz said, eventually left the company. © 2017 Guardian Web syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

MORE IN MOBILE INDUSTRY NEWS Typo Blamed for Amazon's Outage Apple Just Can't Beat its own iPhone In Turmoil, What's Next for Samsung? FCC Chair: Net Neutrality a Mistake New Phones Debut at MWC 2017 Next Article > Typo Blamed for Amazon's Internet-Crippling Outage By Samuel Gibbs. Updated March 03, 2017. Amazon has blamed the outage of its S3 web service, which took down many different sites, services and devices across the internet, on a typo. The failure of a critical section of Amazon Web Services (AWS) called S3 (Simple Storage Solution) on Tuesday, led to sites such as Business Insider and Medium failing, while some people found they could not turn on their internet-connected lightbulbs because automation service Ifttt was knocked offline. Amazon said that at the time of the outage one of its engineers was attempting to diagnose why its billing service for S3 was running slowly. The engineer attempted to take a small subset of the servers for one of S3’s subsystems involved in billing offline for inspection, executing a command from Amazon's "established playbook." Amazon said in an apology to customers: "Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended. The servers that were inadvertently removed supported two other S3 subsystems. One of these subsystems, the index subsystem, manages the metadata and location information of all S3 objects in the region." Like most other cloud providers, Amazon's S3 and other services under the AWS banner are built with redundancy in mind, allowing things to fail without taking out the whole system. But it seems accidentally taking the wrong servers in the wrong quantity offline caused a cascade of more major issues. The problem was compounded by the fact that Amazon hasn't rebooted the indexing system parts of AWS relies on for years. Amazon said: "We have not completely restarted the index subsystem or the placement subsystem in our larger regions for many years. S3 has experienced massive growth over the last several years and the process of restarting these services and running the necessary safety checks to validate the integrity of the metadata took longer than expected." The issue actually only affected Amazon's Northern Virginia region, but that was enough to cause major problems for sites and services using that particular data center region. Amazon apologized for the issue and said that it has put schemes in place to avoid the same problems caused by human error in the future. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Data from search engine Google indicates that six out of the top ten rising search queries  since the year began related to betting sites. Betting site Sportpesa led the list of search items with two other searches on the top ten list— Sportpesa.com and “sportpesa games” — relating to the site. Other betting companies on the list of top ten queries included ‘Betin’, ‘elitebet’ and ‘Betway’ ranking third, fourth and ninth respectively on the list. Sport betting has become popular over the last two years with numerous betting companies setting up shop in the country and punters from all walks of life striving to strike it rich. In early January, Swedish betting firm SpiffX became the latest to make an entry into the Kenyan market through a deal signed by Cheza Gaming Limited.

This indicates that a large number of Internet users were on the look out for job opportunities, and also a sizeable portion of them lacked adequate skills in drafting an application letter. ? Other top search queries during the first two months of the year included “Two Rivers Mall” officially opened by President Uhuru Kenyatta last month. The mall, which is the largest in the region sitting on 100 acres, opened its doors on Valentine’s Day. French retailer Cerrefour is the anchor tenant. Nyeri’s deceased Governor Nderitu Gachagua was the most searched personality during the period under review as Kenyans sought for news on the leader who died at the age of 64 while undergoing treatment in London. Kenya Airways took the tenth position in the list with people following up on the announcement that Kenya’s main airport has been granted category on status. Other top ranking searches included e-commerce site Jumia, social networking sites Instagram, VK and Whatsapp. Google is the largest search engine in the world, processing 40,000 search queries each second and its search reports show a strong correlation with what many internet users find intriguing within a specific duration of time. betting betting tips sportpesa SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Do you have something to add to this story?

Anytime. Anywhere. Sexual Harassment on 'Breathtaking' Scale in Silicon Valley? By Sam Levin PUBLISHED: MARCH 03 2017 Haana was so repulsed by what happened to her, she covered up her mirror so she wouldn’t have to look at herself. The Silicon Valley tech worker said that after drinks with startup colleagues last year, a male executive at her company put his hand up her shirt and groped her while they walked down the street. "I felt disgusted for months after that," said Hanna, who requested that the Guardian not include her full name or identify the small tech startup where she used to do marketing. "It affects me on a level that I wish it didn't." According to Haana, the CEO refused to fire him, and she eventually left the business. Her allegations are far from unique in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, in the male-dominated technology industry, female staffers and workers of color say sexual misconduct, discrimination and retaliation are rampant -- and that men in powerful positions are routinely protected while women are often pushed out of their jobs by harassment. Following the recent viral blogpost of Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer who chronicled claims of sexual harassment and mistreatment, the Guardian has found that similar allegations are widespread across the tech sector. According to a number of prominent attorneys, hundreds if not thousands of women and people of color in tech come forward each year with complaints of toxic work environments largely controlled by white men. Under the guise of "disruption" and "innovation," startups and tech corporations skirt employment laws and reject HR practices while sometimes fostering a party culture where young male executives encourage socializing and drinking. Often, founders hire and promote friends and people similar to them. In these settings, women are vulnerable to all kinds of abuse, ranging from lewd comments to unwanted propositions to groping to assault. "The scale is sort of breathtaking," said Kelly Dermody, an attorney who annually assists hundreds of women in tech and represents thousands across class-action lawsuits. "Most of the women I've worked with in startups have had stories where they have been physically touched, if not worse, without their consent.” In recent years, there have been public claims of sexism and discrimination at numerous high-profile technology companies, including Twitter, Apple, Oracle, Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google.

How to monitor Google Knowledge Graph changes and performance Detailed and accurate Knowledge Graph results are sought after by brands, businesses and individuals alike, but few have a way to actively monitor their listings. Columnist Tony Edward shares his method for doing so. Tony Edward on March 3, 2017 at 10:39 am More Google’s Knowledge Graph is a very prominent part of organic search results. By now, searchers are accustomed to seeing the panel that appears on the right side of the search result page that provides information about entities such as people, places and brands. Individuals and companies alike are striving to acquire, maintain and monitor a Knowledge Graph listing. At the moment, however, there is no easy way to report on Knowledge Graph performance and changes. In 2016, Google’s John Mueller did mention that links in Knowledge Graph panels would be counted in the Search Analytics report in Google Search Console. However, this still does not give us insight into the algorithmic aspect of Knowledge Graph rankings and changes. Why monitor your Knowledge Graph result? So you may be wondering why should you should care about changes to your personal or company Knowledge Graph result. Here are a couple of reasons. You (or your business) may share a name with another entity, or maybe you’re competing against a generic term. Whoever has the most relevance and highest score within the Knowledge Graph algorithm will rank better, and their Knowledge Graph panel will be the one to appear in search results for an unmodified query. Here is an example of a basketball player, author and actor ranking for the name, “Isaiah Thomas.” As you can see, each entity has a score and a different classification type. Not all Knowledge Graph panels are created equal, and Google will add more information to the panel as it discovers information about a person or company. Monitoring changes to a Knowledge Graph result can help you better understand how Google perceives you or your company. It can also validate certain optimizations you may be doing on your website — for example, using structured data. Also, if Google makes a mistake with your information, which can definitely happen, you will know before it’s too late. Monitoring your Knowledge Graph entry In my effort to find a simple solution for tracking Knowledge Graph changes for me and my clients, I found the following solution. It involves using the Google Knowledge Graph API and a tool called VisualPing. By generating an HTTP request for the Knowledge Graph API results and using VisualPing, a tool that monitors web page changes, I can easily track changes within the Knowledge Graph API results. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how to set this up. 1. Set up a Google API Manager account and generate an API Key. 2. Once your API key is generated, visit the Google Knowledge Graph API tool and conduct a search for an entity. Once the results have loaded, grab the URL under the “Request” section, which outlines the HTTP request URL format. Here is URL for my query: 3. Add the API Key you generated into the request URL. Original URL: https://kgsearch.googleapis.com/v1/entities:search?query=Tony+Edward&key={YOUR_API_KEY} Updated URL with API Key: https://kgsearch.googleapis.com/v1/entities:search?query=tony+edward&key=AIzaSyDlqL-acWjyy7UAXZPVOpXw3q1gMiQ8apc Here is what the updated URL looks like in a browser. As you can see, it loads the Knowledge Graph API results for my query directly on the page. Now that this is set up like a web page, we can easily track changes on it.   4. From here, create a VisualPing account and set up a job to track changes for your API Request URL.

Anytime. Anywhere. Sexual Harassment on 'Breathtaking' Scale in Silicon Valley? By Sam Levin PUBLISHED: MARCH 03 2017 Haana was so repulsed by what happened to her, she covered up her mirror so she wouldn’t have to look at herself. The Silicon Valley tech worker said that after drinks with startup colleagues last year, a male executive at her company put his hand up her shirt and groped her while they walked down the street. "I felt disgusted for months after that," said Hanna, who requested that the Guardian not include her full name or identify the small tech startup where she used to do marketing. "It affects me on a level that I wish it didn't." According to Haana, the CEO refused to fire him, and she eventually left the business. Her allegations are far from unique in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, in the male-dominated technology industry, female staffers and workers of color say sexual misconduct, discrimination and retaliation are rampant -- and that men in powerful positions are routinely protected while women are often pushed out of their jobs by harassment. Following the recent viral blogpost of Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer who chronicled claims of sexual harassment and mistreatment, the Guardian has found that similar allegations are widespread across the tech sector. According to a number of prominent attorneys, hundreds if not thousands of women and people of color in tech come forward each year with complaints of toxic work environments largely controlled by white men. Under the guise of "disruption" and "innovation," startups and tech corporations skirt employment laws and reject HR practices while sometimes fostering a party culture where young male executives encourage socializing and drinking. Often, founders hire and promote friends and people similar to them. In these settings, women are vulnerable to all kinds of abuse, ranging from lewd comments to unwanted propositions to groping to assault. "The scale is sort of breathtaking," said Kelly Dermody, an attorney who annually assists hundreds of women in tech and represents thousands across class-action lawsuits. "Most of the women I've worked with in startups have had stories where they have been physically touched, if not worse, without their consent.” In recent years, there have been public claims of sexism and discrimination at numerous high-profile technology companies, including Twitter, Apple, Oracle, Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. But some say the problem is under-reported and particularly acute in early-stage startups where there are no HR departments. There, young CEOs may choose not to fire or reprimand executives who are college friends they consider vital to the company, and when founders or CEOs commit offenses, it can be impossible for women to find justice. More Like a Fraternity In a recent survey of more than 200 women in tech, 60% said they faced unwanted sexual advances, often from superiors. One in three women said they felt afraid for their personal safety, and 66% said they felt excluded because of their gender. The research was inspired by Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, whose discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sparked national debate about misogyny in Silicon Valley. "Most women have experienced some version of this," Pao, who lost her landmark suit, said in an interview last week. She said she hopes the Uber case is a "watershed moment" that inspires the industry to fix a "fundamentally broken" culture. Therese Lawless, an employment attorney who represented Pao and the female engineer at Tesla, said the impact of the social scene at some of the companies can be extreme. "You have a culture which is more like a fraternity than it is a workplace … Sometimes it ends in disaster," she said. "There's a huge range, from sexual assault to propositions for sex to wanting sexual favors in the workplace to unwanted touching to showing of explicit pictures." When young startups grow their businesses at very rapid rates, they fail to properly invest in HR, said Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer with Outten and Golden, the nation's largest firm representing workers in claims against employers. "You have this insular group of like-minded and similar-looking people who are suddenly given immense privilege and opportunity and wealth. And before long, they can feel like they are above the law." Amélie Lamont, a former employee of Squarespace, the popular website design company, said that she felt obligated to go to bars with colleagues for regular hangouts. "If you weren't drinking, you weren't a part of the culture. That was frustrating," said Lamont, who last year published an account of facing racism and sexism as a black female supervisor at Squarespace. "That was really hard keeping up … If you skipped them, it meant you weren't really connecting with your coworkers. You weren't building a strong relationship." Haana, who is in her 20s and has worked for multiple startups, said she has had a close relationship with the CEO of her previous company for years. She said the chief technology officer groped her and that he was friends with the CEO. This kind of intimate nature of an early stage startup makes it challenging to deal with these kinds of conflicts, she said. "When you're involved in a startup, you kind of need to be involved in each other's lives," Haana explained. "You live, you eat, you work together." That made it all the more painful, she said, that no one seemed to take her concerns seriously. "What can I say to make people believe it wasn't my fault?" she said, noting that the incident had a long-term impact on her. "It's something that's a part of me, and I have to figure out how to deal with it. I don't know how to get rid of that anxiety." In phone interviews, the CEO said he didn't think automatically terminating the CTO was an appropriate response, and the CTO denied that he groped Haana but said it's possible she "misinterpreted” a "hug." Pao said the tight-knit nature of startups can make the experience of harassment all the more painful. "If you're not part of that group of founding friends, you're excluded. And that exclusion can take on many forms." 'They Were Going Out of Their Way To Try To Sabotage Her Work' While many victims of discrimination or harassment choose not to file legal complaints or go public, the ones who do speak out face serious risks. Days after her post about Uber, Fowler tweeted that people she knows were being asked for "personal and intimate" information about her as part of what seems to be a "smear campaign." Uber claimed it was not behind the investigation. The company also hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate harassment and vowed to hold offenders accountable. After Lamont, 28, went public about the prejudice and misogyny she said she faced at Squarespace, she faced an onslaught of nasty comments and harassing messages, with some branding her a liar and others lecturing her about how black women should behave. Lamont, who now works as a product design lead at the New York Times, said she was one of a very small handful of black women at Squarespace and that she felt white managers and executives didn't understand her experience. "I felt devalued," she said. "Even going into other jobs, I carried all the baggage." Squarespace did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After she published her post, Lamont said many women of color in tech reached out to share similar stories: "That was validating." One black woman told her about a manager who said she shouldn't wear her hair naturally in an afro or braids because she appeared "too ethnic." Another woman told her she was repeatedly given grunt work that didn't match her level of expertise. Jennifer Schwartz, another Outten and Golden lawyer, said she has represented a number of transgender women in tech who "face shocking and blatant discrimination and impropriety in all forms," including jokes like, "Have you decided today whether you're a man or a woman?" Schwratz said that for one trans female programmer she represented at a successful startup was "consistently marginalized," with men excluding her from meetings and ignoring her successes. "They were going out of their way to try to sabotage her work, creating a sort of clubbiness where the men were patting each other on the back for denigrating her." The woman, Schwartz said, eventually left the company. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Gmail Ups Attachment Limit to 50 MB Next Article > Snap Ready To Cash in with Better-than-Expected IPO By Barbara Ortutay and Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MARCH 02 2017 The company behind the popular messaging app Snapchat is expected to start trading Thursday after a better-than-expected stock offering. Snap Inc. passed its first major test on Wall Street on Wednesday as it priced its initial public offering of 200 million shares at $17 each. That is above the expected range of $14 to $16 and values the Los Angeles company at $24 billion. Snap's IPO is one of the most anticipated for a technology company since Twitter's stock market debut in 2013. Co-founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy will retain controlling power over all matters at Snap; the Class A stock being sold in the IPO has no voting power. Snap is getting the ticker symbol "SNAP" on the New York Stock Exchange. Prospects for Snap For Snap, which started its official bid to go public last Halloween, the looming question now is whether investors are in for a trick or a treat. Snap's Snapchat app is best known for disappearing messages and quirky facial filters for jazzing up selfies. It's popular with teenagers and younger millennials. While Facebook launched in the era of desktop computers and Twitter in text-based mobile, Snapchat jumped straight to photos and videos. In a sense, it's ahead of the game. But its user growth has slowed down in recent months. Blame Facebook. Growth slowed to a crawl since Facebook's Instagram cloned Snapchat's "stories" in August. With the feature, photos and videos shared by users play in a loop for 24 hours, then disappear. The feature helped Snapchat recover from stagnant growth before, but now it's no longer unique to Snapchat. After adding 36 million daily active users during the first half of last year, Snapchat picked up just 15 million in the second half. The number of people downloading Instagram's app has been accelerating during the past six months, suggesting a gradual shift away from the Snapchat app, based on an analysis financial advice site ValuePenguin did of activity in Apple's app store. While the higher-than-expected pricing looks good for Snap, its troubles aren't over. "What that number means for the longer term -- very little," said Chi-Hua Chien, managing partner at Goodwater Capital who originated the VC firm Accel Partners' investment in Facebook and later invested in Twitter while at another firm. Twitter, for example, shot up nearly 73 percent on its first trading day and now trades well below its IPO price. Facebook, meanwhile, saw its stock decline sharply for a few months after going public. Now, it's trading more than three times its IPO price, near a record high. Time Is Limited Snapchat started 2017 with 158 million daily active users, most of whom are people in their teens, 20s and early 30s. But many of them are finding Snapchat harder to fit in with daily life. Evan Rodriguez, a 20-year old student at Abilene Christian University in Texas, used to send snaps of funny stuff he saw throughout the day, just as his friends did. For instance, he might take video of a friend walking across campus and send it via Snapchat -- "Hey, I see you!" But something about the whole thing "just became cumbersome," Rodriguez said. "It was like one more thing to do." Celia Schlekewey, a 20-year-old University of Washington student who also works at a small business, liked the fact that when she first joined, it was "all just about sending pictures to your friends." Over time, the stories feature became a "big deal," and keeping up with friends and famous people became time-consuming. "It got to the point that if I wanted to keep up with everyone's story, I'd have to sit on my phone and watch it for 25 minutes," she said. Easing this feeling of pressure will be key for Snapchat, especially if it wants to attract older users. They might not have as much time -- or might not feel like spending that time on social media -- as their young millennial counterparts. Snapchat's Identity Since Snapchat was never about typing, the phone's camera is already its main focus. In fact, CEO Evan Spiegel has taken to calling it a "camera company," and this is how the company describes itself in its IPO documents. That doesn't necessarily just mean that Snap wants to make cameras, though last year it launched Spectacles, actual physical sunglasses that snap photos for you. Snapchat is more about image-based communication, said Chien of Goodwater Capital. Open the app, and you open a camera. Turn the camera to selfie mode, and you get a bunch of filters to overlay on your face. Because the images you send eventually disappear, there's less pressure to put forward your best self. Snapchat has often drawn comparisons to both Twitter, which also faces stagnant growth, and Facebook, whose users are highly engaged, just like Snapchat's. Ultimately, Snap doesn't have to be like either to succeed and can forge its own path and identity. LaVon Murphy, 45, a photographer in Portland, Oregon, uses Facebook to keep up with friends, Instagram to express herself through pictures and Twitter to keep up with the news. She added Snapchat recently to stay in touch with her 17-year-old son. "I don't really understand why he and his friends use the app so extensively, but I am trying to keep up," she said. "It allows me to be silly and show a silly side of myself to my son and it allows him to be silly with me." Snap just needs millions more like Murphy willing to make time for yet another social network. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

The failure of a critical section of Amazon Web Services (AWS) called S3 (Simple Storage Solution) on Tuesday, led to sites such as Business Insider and Medium failing, while some people found they could not turn on their internet-connected lightbulbs because automation service Ifttt was knocked offline. Amazon said that at the time of the outage one of its engineers was attempting to diagnose why its billing service for S3 was running slowly. The engineer attempted to take a small subset of the servers for one of S3’s subsystems involved in billing offline for inspection, executing a command from Amazon's "established playbook." Amazon said in an apology to customers: "Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended. The servers that were inadvertently removed supported two other S3 subsystems. One of these subsystems, the index subsystem, manages the metadata and location information of all S3 objects in the region." Like most other cloud providers, Amazon's S3 and other services under the AWS banner are built with redundancy in mind, allowing things to fail without taking out the whole system. But it seems accidentally taking the wrong servers in the wrong quantity offline caused a cascade of more major issues. The problem was compounded by the fact that Amazon hasn't rebooted the indexing system parts of AWS relies on for years. Amazon said: "We have not completely restarted the index subsystem or the placement subsystem in our larger regions for many years. S3 has experienced massive growth over the last several years and the process of restarting these services and running the necessary safety checks to validate the integrity of the metadata took longer than expected." The issue actually only affected Amazon's Northern Virginia region, but that was enough to cause major problems for sites and services using that particular data center region. Amazon apologized for the issue and said that it has put schemes in place to avoid the same problems caused by human error in the future. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Cisco Layers Its Service Architecture Next Article > Oracle Expands Cloud Services with Launch of Exadata Cloud Machine By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: MARCH 03 2017 Tech giant Oracle is expanding its 'Oracle Cloud at Customer' portfolio with the launch of its Oracle Exadata Cloud Machine, announced yesterday. Enterprises will be able to deploy Oracle Exadata in a number of ways, including as a cloud service inside their own data center, in the Oracle Cloud or in a traditional on-premises environment, the company said. "With [this] news, Oracle is offering organizations the ultimate in choice and flexibility in where they deploy the world's most advanced database cloud for mission-critical workloads," the company said in a statement. Full Power of Public Cloud Inside a Data Center Since it was first introduced over a year ago, Oracle Cloud at Customer has proved popular with enterprises as a way to help bridge the gap between public cloud and on-premises deployments. While organizations look forward to moving their enterprise workloads to the public cloud, many have been constrained by business, legislative and regulatory requirements that have prevented them from moving their data and applications outside their own datacenters, Oracle said. The Oracle Exadata Cloud Machine is designed to deliver the full power of the Oracle Exadata Cloud Service that resides in Oracle's public cloud to customers that require or prefer their databases to be located on-premises, the company said. "Oracle Exadata Cloud Machine is an ideal platform for organizations that want the benefits of the cloud brought to their datacenter," said Juan Loaiza, senior vice president of systems technologies at Oracle, in the statement. "For many years, Oracle Exadata has been the platform of choice for running mission critical Oracle databases at thousands of customers, and the Oracle Exadata Cloud Machine extends this value proposition to those customers who want cloud benefits but cannot or aren't yet ready to move to a public cloud." Subscription-Based Pricing The new service will provide enterprises with subscription access to the Oracle database with all its usual options and features, such as real application clusters, database in-memory, active data guard and advanced security, high levels of performance, availability and security features for mission-critical workloads, the company said. Additionally, the Oracle Exadata Cloud Machine is 100 percent compatible with on-premises as well as Oracle Cloud applications and databases, ensuring any existing application can be quickly migrated to the cloud without changes. Among the features included in Exadata Cloud Machine are a mission-critical database for OLTP; analytics; mixed workloads and consolidation; a database hardware platform with NVMe Flash,and InfiniBand networking; and an advanced database cloud platform with subscription-based pricing and real-time online capacity bursting. Oracle said the flexible cloud can be deployed either in its public cloud or inside the customer's datacenter, with Oracle managing all of the infrastructure. The new service should also facilitate migration to the cloud with software and hardware that are fully compatible. "The business model is just like a public cloud subscription; the hardware and software is the same; Oracle experts monitor and manage the infrastructure; and the same tools used in Oracle’s public cloud are used to provision resources on the Cloud Machine," the company said in the statement.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Anna Leach and Olivia Boyd. Updated March 3, 2017 8:35AM SHARE ALSO SEE Smartphone Environment Electronic Waste E-Waste Recycling Mobile World Congress At the smartphone world’s annual shindig in Barcelona, there are some things the tech giants have been trying to get people talking about -- the relaunch of the Nokia 3310, BlackBerry’s new fingerprint scanner, Samsung’s virtual reality headset. But there’s another, less glamorous story that they haven’t been so keen to promote. And that concerns the fate of their gadgets when consumers have finished with them. On Sunday, Greenpeace interrupted a Samsung press conference to protest the company’s failure to produce a recycling plan for the defective Galaxy Note 7, recalled last year due to fire risk. The campaign group claims Samsung has 4.3m handsets to get rid of. A Samsung spokesperson has since said the company is working 'to ensure a responsible disposal plan" for its defunct phones, and prioritizing safety and environment. But if the piled up Galaxy Note 7s go the same way as the rest of our old smartphones, computers and tablets, where might they end up? Sending E-Waste Offshore Since the start of 2017, we have thrown out more than 6.4m tons of electronic goods, according to The World Counts, a website keeping a live tally of global e-waste. If past patterns are any judge, not much of this will get properly recycled: less than a sixth of the e-waste discarded around the world in 2014 was dealt with in this way, says the UN. Even in developed countries with advanced infrastructure, electronics recycling rates are low. The US recycled just 29% (pdf) of the 3.4m ton of e-waste it produced in 2012, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, while the rest was sent to landfill or incinerated. "Our recycling rates for electronics are abysmal," says Jim Puckett, executive director and founder of the Basel Action Network (BAN), an NGO. He estimates that 5% of metals used in electronics are recycled, at most. When products are handed over for recycling, a portion end up in informal recycling hotspots in developing countries, such as Accra in Ghana or parts of southern China, where they are broken down in an uncontrolled environment, Puckett explains. UN figures suggest up to 90% of the world’s e-waste is illegally dumped. "We sweep everything to developing countries where they have the least infrastructure and efficient recycling," says Puckett. In a recent experiment, BAN placed GPS trackers on 205 old printers and monitors to see what happened to them. Of the devices handed over for recycling, 40% were sent offshore, mostly to Asia. BAN’s team followed 37 of them to Hong Kong, where it found workers breaking down electronics by hand in informal junkyards. This kind of unregulated processing of e-waste carries severe consequences for environment and human health, including air pollution when circuit boards are heated to access the metals, soil pollution as chemicals seep into the earth, and water pollution as toxic materials get into groundwater and other supplies. Lost Value Recycling failures also lead to a waste of precious materials, like gold, copper and platinum. This not only means that fresh supplies are mined unnecessarily, but also that money is wasted through missed recycling opportunities. Potential revenues from e-waste recycling in the European market in 2014 were as high as 2bn euros, estimates Sheffield University’s center for energy, environment and sustainability. Companies including Microsoft and Dell have sought to address their e-waste footprint by partnering with third-party organizations like Goodwill, which sells or recycles donated electronics. Last year Apple unveiled a recycling robot called Liam, who it says can take apart an iPhone in 11 seconds. More recent ideas have included a mobile phone offset scheme, launched on Tuesday by recycling company Sims Recycling Solutions and Dutch social enterprise Closing the Loop. They promise to remove one phone from an e-waste dump for every phone used by the scheme’s customers, including ING Bank. Puckett believes more systemic change is needed, however. When it comes to tackling the sheer quantity of discarded electronics, he says progress will only come via market-based incentives for longer-lasting electronics. A system where electronics are leased out rather than bought and sold, for example, would incentivize companies to make products last as long as possible, he says. © 2017 Guardian Web syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Snap Inc. passed its first major test on Wall Street on Wednesday as it priced its initial public offering of 200 million shares at $17 each. That is above the expected range of $14 to $16 and values the Los Angeles company at $24 billion. Snap's IPO is one of the most anticipated for a technology company since Twitter's stock market debut in 2013. Co-founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy will retain controlling power over all matters at Snap; the Class A stock being sold in the IPO has no voting power. Snap is getting the ticker symbol "SNAP" on the New York Stock Exchange. Prospects for Snap For Snap, which started its official bid to go public last Halloween, the looming question now is whether investors are in for a trick or a treat. Snap's Snapchat app is best known for disappearing messages and quirky facial filters for jazzing up selfies. It's popular with teenagers and younger millennials. While Facebook launched in the era of desktop computers and Twitter in text-based mobile, Snapchat jumped straight to photos and videos. In a sense, it's ahead of the game. But its user growth has slowed down in recent months. Blame Facebook. Growth slowed to a crawl since Facebook's Instagram cloned Snapchat's "stories" in August. With the feature, photos and videos shared by users play in a loop for 24 hours, then disappear. The feature helped Snapchat recover from stagnant growth before, but now it's no longer unique to Snapchat. After adding 36 million daily active users during the first half of last year, Snapchat picked up just 15 million in the second half. The number of people downloading Instagram's app has been accelerating during the past six months, suggesting a gradual shift away from the Snapchat app, based on an analysis financial advice site ValuePenguin did of activity in Apple's app store. While the higher-than-expected pricing looks good for Snap, its troubles aren't over. "What that number means for the longer term -- very little," said Chi-Hua Chien, managing partner at Goodwater Capital who originated the VC firm Accel Partners' investment in Facebook and later invested in Twitter while at another firm. Twitter, for example, shot up nearly 73 percent on its first trading day and now trades well below its IPO price. Facebook, meanwhile, saw its stock decline sharply for a few months after going public. Now, it's trading more than three times its IPO price, near a record high. Time Is Limited Snapchat started 2017 with 158 million daily active users, most of whom are people in their teens, 20s and early 30s. But many of them are finding Snapchat harder to fit in with daily life. Evan Rodriguez, a 20-year old student at Abilene Christian University in Texas, used to send snaps of funny stuff he saw throughout the day, just as his friends did. For instance, he might take video of a friend walking across campus and send it via Snapchat -- "Hey, I see you!" But something about the whole thing "just became cumbersome," Rodriguez said. "It was like one more thing to do." Celia Schlekewey, a 20-year-old University of Washington student who also works at a small business, liked the fact that when she first joined, it was "all just about sending pictures to your friends." Over time, the stories feature became a "big deal," and keeping up with friends and famous people became time-consuming. "It got to the point that if I wanted to keep up with everyone's story, I'd have to sit on my phone and watch it for 25 minutes," she said. Easing this feeling of pressure will be key for Snapchat, especially if it wants to attract older users. They might not have as much time -- or might not feel like spending that time on social media -- as their young millennial counterparts. Snapchat's Identity Since Snapchat was never about typing, the phone's camera is already its main focus. In fact, CEO Evan Spiegel has taken to calling it a "camera company," and this is how the company describes itself in its IPO documents. That doesn't necessarily just mean that Snap wants to make cameras, though last year it launched Spectacles, actual physical sunglasses that snap photos for you. Snapchat is more about image-based communication, said Chien of Goodwater Capital. Open the app, and you open a camera. Turn the camera to selfie mode, and you get a bunch of filters to overlay on your face. Because the images you send eventually disappear, there's less pressure to put forward your best self. Snapchat has often drawn comparisons to both Twitter, which also faces stagnant growth, and Facebook, whose users are highly engaged, just like Snapchat's. Ultimately, Snap doesn't have to be like either to succeed and can forge its own path and identity. LaVon Murphy, 45, a photographer in Portland, Oregon, uses Facebook to keep up with friends, Instagram to express herself through pictures and Twitter to keep up with the news. She added Snapchat recently to stay in touch with her 17-year-old son. "I don't really understand why he and his friends use the app so extensively, but I am trying to keep up," she said. "It allows me to be silly and show a silly side of myself to my son and it allows him to be silly with me." Snap just needs millions more like Murphy willing to make time for yet another social network. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

It is no longer available for new publishers to sign up for. So if you want to use it on a new blog or you are new to AdSense, you need to find a different plugin. On April 5, 2017 existing publishers will not be able to change their ad settings or ad units through the plugin. Then on May 3, 2017 Google will no longer provide support for the plugin. Google said "We frequently review our products and features to ensure they're providing maximum value to our users. After reviewing the AdSense Plugin for WordPress, we've decided that going forward we can better support WordPress publishers through new innovative features like our automatic ad formats and other upcoming initiatives." Here are the "key dates" which I already summarized above: Early March, 2017: New publishers will not be able to sign up for AdSense by using the plugin. Early April, 2017: Existing publishers will not be able to change their ad settings or ad units through the plugin. Early May, 2017: Google will no longer provide support for the plugin.

By Sam Levin PUBLISHED: MARCH 03 2017 Haana was so repulsed by what happened to her, she covered up her mirror so she wouldn’t have to look at herself. The Silicon Valley tech worker said that after drinks with startup colleagues last year, a male executive at her company put his hand up her shirt and groped her while they walked down the street. "I felt disgusted for months after that," said Hanna, who requested that the Guardian not include her full name or identify the small tech startup where she used to do marketing. "It affects me on a level that I wish it didn't." According to Haana, the CEO refused to fire him, and she eventually left the business. Her allegations are far from unique in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, in the male-dominated technology industry, female staffers and workers of color say sexual misconduct, discrimination and retaliation are rampant -- and that men in powerful positions are routinely protected while women are often pushed out of their jobs by harassment. Following the recent viral blogpost of Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer who chronicled claims of sexual harassment and mistreatment, the Guardian has found that similar allegations are widespread across the tech sector. According to a number of prominent attorneys, hundreds if not thousands of women and people of color in tech come forward each year with complaints of toxic work environments largely controlled by white men. Under the guise of "disruption" and "innovation," startups and tech corporations skirt employment laws and reject HR practices while sometimes fostering a party culture where young male executives encourage socializing and drinking. Often, founders hire and promote friends and people similar to them. In these settings, women are vulnerable to all kinds of abuse, ranging from lewd comments to unwanted propositions to groping to assault. "The scale is sort of breathtaking," said Kelly Dermody, an attorney who annually assists hundreds of women in tech and represents thousands across class-action lawsuits. "Most of the women I've worked with in startups have had stories where they have been physically touched, if not worse, without their consent.” In recent years, there have been public claims of sexism and discrimination at numerous high-profile technology companies, including Twitter, Apple, Oracle, Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. But some say the problem is under-reported and particularly acute in early-stage startups where there are no HR departments. There, young CEOs may choose not to fire or reprimand executives who are college friends they consider vital to the company, and when founders or CEOs commit offenses, it can be impossible for women to find justice. More Like a Fraternity In a recent survey of more than 200 women in tech, 60% said they faced unwanted sexual advances, often from superiors. One in three women said they felt afraid for their personal safety, and 66% said they felt excluded because of their gender. The research was inspired by Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, whose discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sparked national debate about misogyny in Silicon Valley. "Most women have experienced some version of this," Pao, who lost her landmark suit, said in an interview last week. She said she hopes the Uber case is a "watershed moment" that inspires the industry to fix a "fundamentally broken" culture. Therese Lawless, an employment attorney who represented Pao and the female engineer at Tesla, said the impact of the social scene at some of the companies can be extreme. "You have a culture which is more like a fraternity than it is a workplace … Sometimes it ends in disaster," she said. "There's a huge range, from sexual assault to propositions for sex to wanting sexual favors in the workplace to unwanted touching to showing of explicit pictures." When young startups grow their businesses at very rapid rates, they fail to properly invest in HR, said Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer with Outten and Golden, the nation's largest firm representing workers in claims against employers. "You have this insular group of like-minded and similar-looking people who are suddenly given immense privilege and opportunity and wealth. And before long, they can feel like they are above the law." Amélie Lamont, a former employee of Squarespace, the popular website design company, said that she felt obligated to go to bars with colleagues for regular hangouts. "If you weren't drinking, you weren't a part of the culture. That was frustrating," said Lamont, who last year published an account of facing racism and sexism as a black female supervisor at Squarespace. "That was really hard keeping up … If you skipped them, it meant you weren't really connecting with your coworkers. You weren't building a strong relationship." Haana, who is in her 20s and has worked for multiple startups, said she has had a close relationship with the CEO of her previous company for years. She said the chief technology officer groped her and that he was friends with the CEO. This kind of intimate nature of an early stage startup makes it challenging to deal with these kinds of conflicts, she said. "When you're involved in a startup, you kind of need to be involved in each other's lives," Haana explained. "You live, you eat, you work together." That made it all the more painful, she said, that no one seemed to take her concerns seriously. "What can I say to make people believe it wasn't my fault?" she said, noting that the incident had a long-term impact on her. "It's something that's a part of me, and I have to figure out how to deal with it. I don't know how to get rid of that anxiety." In phone interviews, the CEO said he didn't think automatically terminating the CTO was an appropriate response, and the CTO denied that he groped Haana but said it's possible she "misinterpreted” a "hug." Pao said the tight-knit nature of startups can make the experience of harassment all the more painful. "If you're not part of that group of founding friends, you're excluded. And that exclusion can take on many forms." 'They Were Going Out of Their Way To Try To Sabotage Her Work' While many victims of discrimination or harassment choose not to file legal complaints or go public, the ones who do speak out face serious risks. Days after her post about Uber, Fowler tweeted that people she knows were being asked for "personal and intimate" information about her as part of what seems to be a "smear campaign." Uber claimed it was not behind the investigation. The company also hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate harassment and vowed to hold offenders accountable. After Lamont, 28, went public about the prejudice and misogyny she said she faced at Squarespace, she faced an onslaught of nasty comments and harassing messages, with some branding her a liar and others lecturing her about how black women should behave. Lamont, who now works as a product design lead at the New York Times, said she was one of a very small handful of black women at Squarespace and that she felt white managers and executives didn't understand her experience. "I felt devalued," she said. "Even going into other jobs, I carried all the baggage." Squarespace did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After she published her post, Lamont said many women of color in tech reached out to share similar stories: "That was validating." One black woman told her about a manager who said she shouldn't wear her hair naturally in an afro or braids because she appeared "too ethnic." Another woman told her she was repeatedly given grunt work that didn't match her level of expertise. Jennifer Schwartz, another Outten and Golden lawyer, said she has represented a number of transgender women in tech who "face shocking and blatant discrimination and impropriety in all forms," including jokes like, "Have you decided today whether you're a man or a woman?" Schwratz said that for one trans female programmer she represented at a successful startup was "consistently marginalized," with men excluding her from meetings and ignoring her successes. "They were going out of their way to try to sabotage her work, creating a sort of clubbiness where the men were patting each other on the back for denigrating her." The woman, Schwartz said, eventually left the company. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

In fact, it can report four-times more traffic than is real. Truth is, this was documented and Google recommended you set up its own profile for now to separate this out. In any event, Google is aware of the issue and said it is complex but they do plan to work on it - one day. Here is Google's Malte Ubl on this concern: @bastanzio @christian_wilde this is essentially correct. Should be documented somewhere as a known issue.— Malte Ubl (@cramforce) March 2, 2017 @christian_wilde @bastanzio yes, but not an easy fix.— Malte Ubl (@cramforce) March 2, 2017 What is the outcome? This is how Christian summarized it: Unique visitors: as we have just checked, a user accessing from the same device, using the same browser and withouth deleting cookies, can be counted as up to 4 unique visitors depending on how he/she access our AMP pages. Sessions: if a user visits an AMP page, in any of the environments and leaves, there is no problem in terms of sessions. But, if he continue navigating our website, from the AMP page to any other non-AMP page on our website, apart from being counted as a new Unique Visitor, a new session is started, so it is counted as two sessions. Bounce rate: due to the previous reasons, when a session is divided in two, the first session would have only one pageview (so it will be counted as a bounce). The second session, if it only checks one page, would also be considered a bounce. So, the bounce rate will be increased incorrectly (the complete session should not be considered a bounce, but it ends being two bounce sessions). And this happens both for AMP and non-AMP pages. Pageviews per session: also in consequence of the previous reasons, instead of having 2 pageviews/session, we would have 1 pageview/session. Traffic sources: traffic coming from our AMP pages to our non-AMP pages from 3rd parties, will be counted as entry traffic (new sessions) and its source would be “Referral Traffic”, from cdn.ampproject.org (or yourwebsite.cdn.ampproject.org) We have no idea when this will be resolved by Google, it has been an issue since Google launched AMP.

We’ve got news about cyber security, smartphone sales, sponsored content and lots more. Don’t forget to download the famous Internet Statistics Compendium for further insight and analysis.  Amazon generated 471.4m clicks from paid advertising in 2016 Analysis from Adgooroo has found that Amazon topped all US paid search advertisers last year, generating 471.4m clicks in 2016, far beating the 245.6m generated by Weather.com.  Macys was third with 167.6m clicks, followed by The Home Depot with 146.1 clicks. Meanwhile, Apple ranked 17th with 57.8m clicks, becoming the only technology brand in the list.  65% of Brits access the internet from their smartphone A new report from Google suggests that the days of thinking of a smartphone as a secondary device are gone. In contrast to just 35% in 2012, 65% of people now say they regularly use their smartphone to access the internet – almost double the amount previously. Google’s study, which involved 625.000 interviews with consumers around the world, also found that three in four people in the UK now use a smartphone, with the average Brit now using 3.3 internet-connected devices. Lastly, 54% of Brits say they prefer to do a task digitally if possible, while 50% reach for their smartphone first thing in the morning, using it as their primary alarm clock.  48% of organisational leaders are unsure they’re addressing needs across digital platforms PointSource’s latest study has highlighted some of the key areas of concern for companies executing a digital transformation strategy. Despite an increased demand for seamless digital experiences at every step of the customer journey, many organisations are struggling to meet these higher expectations.  In fact, 48% of organisational leaders report that they aren’t sure they’re accurately addressing their audiences needs across platforms, while 84% say their organisation has outdated legacy systems that impact the ability to improve their digital experiences.  Cyber security breaches cost UK businesses nearly £30bn in 2016 New research from Beaming has revealed that 52% of British businesses fell victim to cybercrime in 2016. This indicates that 2.9m UK firms suffered security breaches, costing a total of £29.1bn. 23% of businesses suffered computer viruses and phishing attacks, making this the most common type of cyber threat. Meanwhile, 18% of businesses suffered some form or hack or data breach. The research also shows that cyber security breaches increases with business size, as 71% of organisations with more than 250 employees fell victim last year, compared to 31% with fewer than 10 people. Best Picture mishap drives social media engagement for Oscars Fresh data from 4C has shown how social media users reacted to Sunday night’s Oscars. Unsurprisingly, the Best Picture mishap saw the biggest surge, with over 634,000 engagements in the minutes immediately afterwards. The moment also generated 4,200 rebroadcasts across 728 channels in the US in the 10 hours after the event. In terms of brands, Cadillac’s 60-second advertisement drew 45,533 engagements and 89% positive sentiment, while Meryl Streep’s outfit change helped the designer Elie Saab earn over 21,000 engagements. Only 50% of consumers are using mobile coupons A study by Walker Sands has found that just 50% of US mobile users redeemed a coupon last year, despite the fact that 53% believe it would improve their in-store experience. With 57% of retailers currently offering mobile coupons, it’s not due to a lack of opportunity. Instead, it could be due to a disconnect between retailers’ offerings and consumer expectations for a digital streamlined experiences. With the majority of consumers still choosing paper coupons over mobile offers, it seems the latter is failing to provide anything of additional value. Almost two-thirds of insurers are neglecting mobile and tablet users From analysis of major UK insurers and aggregators, Dock9 has found that 28% are ignoring mobile and tablet users by failing to design websites for these devices.  Out of those that do consider these devices, 57% are still failing to create touch-optimised sites, making the customer quote-to-buy journey over a quarter longer than necessary. In a ranking of online quote-and-buy experiences, AXA, Go Compare and Simply Business came out on top in terms of the best, while Quantum PLC, Markel Direct and The Insurance Octopus were found to be the worst. One in six people bought a smartphone in 2015 A new report by the EU Intellectual Property Office highlights how in 2015, 12.9% of legitimate global sales of smartphones were lost due to the presence of counterfeits – an equivalent of €45.3bn. This comes from analysis of the number of smartphones sold in 90 countries in every region in the world, based on point-of-sale tracking of consumer purchases. The report also found that 1.3bn smartphones were sold worldwide in 2015, meaning that approximately one out of every six people on the planet purchased a smartphone that year.  Half of marketers feel disconnected from the c-suite In a survey of 600 global senior marketing professionals, Squiz has found that 50% feel disconnected from the c-suite. Despite 78% of senior marketers feeling confident in explaining the value of technology investments, 52% think that other c-level execs don’t understand marketing. Meanwhile, just 33% think that the c-suite understands the value of martech at a financial level. As a result of this, stakeholder buy-in is still a key challenge for 32% of marketers, with a further 28% failing to feel that they can confidently set goals that the whole business can support. One third of publishers are failing to correctly label sponsored content According to MediaRadar, more than one third of publishers are failing to label sponsored content correctly, risking both reputation and revenue. From the analysis of ads from 12,000 brands during 2016, the study found that 37% of digital publishers were not native compliant. However, there has been some improvement, since a previous study had found this figure to be 71%. Currently, the biggest culprits appear to be smaller publishers. 74% used terms such as ‘sponsored’ and 11% used ‘promoted’ rather than the FTC-approved "sponsored content". Lastly, 5% of publishers provided no labelling at all. Published 3 March, 2017 by Nikki Gilliland @ Econsultancy Nikki is a Writer at Econsultancy.

Telefonica SA’s O2 unit — one of the first mobile operators in Britain to offer car insurance — expanded its product line in February to include telematics boxes, which track people’s driving habits and can lead to cheaper premiums for youngsters. That’s stoking speculation that a wave of fintech companies will push into the market and disrupt the way insurers interact with customers. Cell-phone or internet companies could, for example, use the massive amount of data they hold on their customers to sell them car insurance, bypassing traditional brokers and price-comparison websites.  Alphabet Inc.’s Google entry into price comparisons last year failed, but analysts say the web giant could come back and have another go. “No doubt Google will figure out a way to come back,” said Christopher Ling, a regional leader at Capgemini SA’s insurance practice for the U.K. and Europe in London. “For O2, it’s more dipping a toe in the water at the moment. Other ideas could be using mobile-phone data for home and health monitoring and the insurance associated with that.” Google did not respond to requests for comment. The insurance industry has long feared the entry of companies such as Google, Amazon.com Inc. or Facebook Inc. which have a closer relationship to customers — and above all better data on them. The potential disruption to the market is adding to pressure on providers already seeing their investments hurt by record-low interest rates. Insurers are reacting to the challenge. Allianz SE Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete has pledged to make Europe’s biggest insurer “digital by default” to help boost productivity and retain clients. Thomas Buberl, CEO of AXA SA, told investors last year that “customers are now used to buying things at Amazon to interact with Google and Facebook, they are demanding the same from us and, as you can imagine, buying an insurance policy at Axa is not yet quite the same as buying a book at Amazon.” O2 has jumped into “what is undoubtedly a very competitive market,” said Mark Evans, CEO of Telefonica’s U.K. unit. It plans to use technology “to identify driver behavior and therefore incentivize very attractive packages for those who drive responsibly.” Telefonica also offers car insurance in Spain and has offered products in the U.K. since 2015. Partner Up Fintech companies are already a growing, if limited, part of the global market: 173 startups focusing on insurance  got funding last year compared with 122 in 2015, according to venture-capital researcher CB Insights. The key for any newcomer will be finding the right partner, Capgemini’s Ling said. O2’s insurance business operates through a tie-up with Peterborough-based insurer BGL Group Ltd., which is also behind insurance offerings by companies including U.K. funeral care to supermarkets operator Co-Operative Group Ltd. and roadside-assistance company RAC. “The market for U.K. consumer insurance has always been incredibly competitive and another one in the mix certainly won’t help the margins,” said Ben Cohen, a London-based analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “It remains to be seen how new entrants in the insurance market grapple with data-privacy issues.” Shock Suggestion Citigroup Inc. analysts provided a wake-up call for the insurance industry a year ago when they suggested Google’s parent should buy insurer American International Group Inc. and turn it into a laboratory for innovation, possibly using the tech company’s client data to set policy prices. Alphabet shut down its Google Compare service, which included insurance, in 2016 after the site failed to generate substantially more revenue that standard search ads for the products, the Wall Street Journal reporter at the time. But Baidu Inc., Google’s Chinese equivalent, and hedge-fund firm Hillhouse Capital Management Ltd. formed a venture with Allianz in 2015 to provide digital-insurance services in the Asian nation. “Monetizing mobile data is an incredibly exciting proposition,” Capgemini’s Ling said. “Other people will start to realize the potential of that in the same way as Google has realized the potential of monetizing Internet traffic.” Copyright 2017 Bloomberg.

However, underneath, it appears that Google is finally working on proper image search in version 6.14 and is adding other photo-related features. Not currently live, the feature will be accessible from the Google app’s navigation menu. Tapping ‘Visual Search’ will launch an interface with a camera view and a large bottom bar that tells users to tap on any part of the image. A top bar shows the Google logo as well as a beta tag. After selecting a part of the photo, users will be presented with a carousel of search suggestions in a card-like format that features a corresponding cover image. Tapping on one will open full search results. Searching with images is technically already possible with Screen search (previously Now on Tap), though the workflow is not too obvious. Then again, with Google Assistant — which began rolling out yesterday — not having this functionality, it makes sense to have a dedicated part of the app for this feature. Other changes in this version include the save feature in Google Images being added to the navigation drawer. ‘Saves’ is organized with tabs for ‘Saved items’ and ‘Tags.’ Its new location is much more accessible then first having to go to the image tab and might encourage usage of the feature. Neither ‘Visual Search’ or ‘Saves’ is live, though it might be enabled for some users as part of A/B testing. Sign up to beta test the Google app here.

With this update, when users apply one of the app’s “looks” to a photo, Google Photos will now correct the image’s white balance, in addition to its exposure and saturation. Google introduced the “looks” feature in Google Photos late last year. Users can choose from a variety of looks, which will alter a picture in numerous ways. Jingyu Cui, software engineer for Google Photos, explained looks in a November 2016 blog post: These unique looks make edits based on the individual photo and its brightness, darkness, warmth, or saturation, before applying the style. All looks use machine intelligence to complement the content of your photo, and choosing one is just a matter of taste. Auto white balance in looks is now rolling out to Google Photos users on Android and the web. The feature is coming soon to iOS. Elsewhere, Google shared six tips to help users improve their images.

Locksmiths try again to sue Google over fake local listings Search engines can assert immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Greg Sterling on March 3, 2017 at 10:43 am More Here’s a familiar story: a group of locksmiths has filed a class action lawsuit against Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. They claim the search engines (Google in particular) are deliberately “flooding” organic results with “scam locksmith listings” known to be false. They argue the fake listings force legitimate locksmiths to buy ads to gain access to customers who would otherwise see them via organic search results. The case is in Federal District Court in Washington, D.C. These are some of the alleged facts from the complaint: Defendants knowingly and deliberately flood organic search results displayed in response to queries such as “locksmith” (and related terms) with scam locksmith listings they know: 1) do not exist at all, or at least not at the locations indicated, 2) operate for the purpose of defrauding the consumer public, 3) are not licensed in jurisdictions mandating locksmith licensing, 4) are unregistered to do business in jurisdictions (such as DC) requiring business registration. Defendants flood the market with fictitious listings to dilute Plaintiffs’ and other legitimate locksmiths’ listing in the organic and map results to the point of obscurity, thereby compelling legitimate locksmiths to pay Defendants for paid advertised results merely to be seen by the same prospective customers. (emphasis added) Among the legal claims being made by the locksmiths are: conspiracy, fraud, unfair competition and other claims under various state and federal laws. The plaintiffs argue that Google “is fully aware of the nation-wide scam problem and is doing little to address the issue” because it and the other search engines financially benefit from the presence of these scam listings. They further claim that most jurisdictions have licensing requirements for locksmiths and that those rules have been willfully disregarded by the search engines. (Google and the other engines are certainly aware of the issue because they’ve been sued over the same issue before.) Plaintiffs represent a potential nationwide class and are asking for Google to stop showing results, listings and map pins for locksmiths that aren’t licensed in the jurisdiction. They’re also asking the search engines to “cease and desist publishing paid advertisements for unlicensed locksmiths in jurisdictions requiring locksmith licensing.” Damages sought by plaintiffs include “lost good will and ongoing client relationships” as well as “lost publicity.” The plaintiffs are also seeking punitive damages. While it’s easy to sympathize with the aggrieved locksmiths, the law favors Google, Bing and Yahoo. They will likely be able to avoid liability under internet-publisher immunity provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

Google’s plans of rolling out the Google Assistant for Android devices was initially unveiled during the Mobile World Congress 2017. The availability of the update will not be in the form of an app. Instead, Google will introduce the Google Assistant to Android devices through the inclusion of a functionality in the Google Play Store. An update to Google Play services will pop up in the Google Play Store, which means you’re getting the Assistant on your device. Users must be using an Android Marshmallow or Nougat device with at least 1.5 GB of RAM and 720 px resolution screen to be able to avail Assistant’s new features. Google announced the expansion of the Google Assistant to Android devices via a tweet too.   Now rolling out to more @Android phones, it’s time to meet your #GoogleAssistant ? https://t.co/tu9bGCgo7F pic.twitter.com/aeWdgBTJH1 — Google (@Google) March 2, 2017 While the other eligible Android devices are waiting for the update, the LG G6 bagged the title of being the first non-Pixel phone to be shipped with Google Assistant. Google claims that “hundreds of millions of Android users” will now be able to use the Google Assistant, instead of the voice search feature. In order to activate the Google Assistant, all the user has to do is long press the Home button. Though Google hasn’t specified the list of “eligible” devices, the update will first be available to Android users in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom,Australia, Canada and Germany. As far as users in India are concerned, it has not yet been ascertained when the Google Assistant update will be launched here. likethis What's your reaction?

By Liam Tung | March 3, 2017 -- 13:57 GMT (05:57 PST) | Topic: Security After the Android bug bounty, Chinese researchers now receive the most rewards and the most cash from Google. Image: Google Google has raised its top reward for remote code execution bugs in its Google, Blogger and YouTube domains from an even $20,000 to $31,337, marking a 50 percent rise plus a bonus $1,337 or 'leet' reward. It's also bumped up its 'Unrestricted file system or database access' reward by 30 percent plus 'leet' to $13,337. "Because high-severity vulnerabilities have become harder to identify over the years, researchers have needed more time to find them. We want to demonstrate our appreciation for the significant time researchers dedicate to our program," security program manager Josh Armour wrote. As previously reported, Google in 2016 paid about $3m to security researchers who reported bugs in this program, as well as the Chrome and Android rewards program. Google has also revealed which countries' researchers are scooping up the most rewards. Hackers from China shot into the lead in 2016 from fourth spot in 2015 due largely to the Android bounty, which kicked off in mid-2015. Reports from Asia were up 300 percent last year, and these made up 70 percent of the Android rewards program, according to Armour. Android bugs netted researchers $1m last year. After China, the most rewards went to researchers in the US, followed by India, Germany, France, UK, Israel, Russia, Poland, and Canada. The distribution of payments paints a different picture of the performance of researchers in each country. Researchers from China picked up $675,000 last year, leading the world by the total value of rewards. In second place, Russian researchers earned $351,000, followed by Polish researchers who earned a total of $341,000, and US researchers who received $214,000. Despite being the third-largest source of bug reports, researchers in India earned $84,000 from Google, behind Taiwan on $156,000, the UK with $142,000, Ukraine's $139,00, the Netherlands' $106,000, Israel's $114,000, and Finland's $85,000. However, Armour noted that Google had received reports from 40 percent more Indian researchers and paid out 30 percent more rewards. The number of researchers participating from Germany and France was also up 27 percent and 44 percent, respectively. Google's breakdown of the $3m it paid researchers in 2016 shows that about $800,000 went to bugs valued at between $1,338 and $3,133.7. Rewards in the $5,001 to $7,500 bracket totaled over $700,000, while rewards greater than $20,000 amounted to $400,000. Signaling the large job of sifting through valid reports, Google's graph showing the distribution of bugs by severity shows that most of the reports it received were invalid.

Image: Cookie Jam/Youtube By Anisa Purbasari2017-03-03 15:47:17 UTC Mobile game developers will soon have a new tool to lure players to their latest releases. At the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this week, Google announced a new feature called "Playables" for iOS and Android developers. It allows users to test-drive a lightweight version of a game within an advertisement. In other words, there's no app download required—and it all happens while you're in another game.  So much for our attention spans. SEE ALSO: This 'GOT' star teamed up with Google to capture Greenland's melting ice Playables is one of the formats available in Google's Universal App Campaigns, a tool that allows developers to have their ads placed across several Google properties just by writing a few lines of text. It's currently available to some advertisers, but the tech giant plans to start rolling it out to all Universal App Campaign clients soon, a spokesperson for Google said, so you can expect to see the feature more often.   Playables could eliminate the hassle of downloading a game only to figure out that it's kind of terrible, though Google admits the the feature was created mainly for developers. In addition to giving them an additional tool to reel in new customers, Playables can also encourage existing users to play a game even more than they already do.  A Google rep wouldn't say whether it plans to develop a similar feature for non-gaming apps but did say, "We anticipate that marketers and ad agencies will get very creative on how they use Playables to drive downloads as well as brand awareness and sales." CORRECTION March 3, 2017, 1:52 p.m. EST This article originally stated that Playables is available for Android developers. It is also open to iOS developers.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars CLOUD Google and Coursera launch Cloud Platform training courses for businesses Paul Sawers@psawers March 3, 2017 8:10 AM Tags: coursera, Google, Google Cloud, MOOC, top-stories Above: Coursera & Google Cloud Google has turned to online education platform Coursera to launch a handful of training courses centered on the Google Cloud Platform. Founded out of California in 2012, Coursera partners with businesses and educational institutions to serve more than 20 million online students a range of courses across business, technology, science, and more. It’s one of a number of so-called MOOCs — massive open online courses — to gain traction in recent years, and has raised around $150 million in VC investment. Back in September, Google announced the launch of Google Cloud, which was essentially a rebranding and repackaging of its numerous cloud services, including its public cloud infrastructure, Google Apps for Work, and various enterprise applications. With companies increasingly embracing the cloud for their in-house operations, Google now wants to school firms in everything from data analytics and operations, to machine learning and configuration management. It’s all about filling the skills gap and giving businesses the confidence to migrate to the cloud. “As more and more companies wish to take advantage of what cloud computing, data analytics and machine learning can do for their businesses, the gap between the knowledge needed to move to the cloud and the demand for such skills has grown enormously,” explained Louise Byrne, head of cloud training delivery at Google. “Lack of expertise and cloud skills is often cited as the top challenge for companies wishing to migrate their business to the cloud.” The courses have been developed by “Google experts,” according to a blog post post on the matter, who also lead on the teaching side of things. Today’s launch comes four months after Google snapped up Qwiklabs, a startup specializing in training courses for people to learn all about public cloud infrastructure services. And that acquisition, it seems, was the genesis for this latest tie-up with Coursera. Google is no stranger to partnering with online education startups. It has previously teamed up with Coursera rival Udacity to launch courses covering virtual reality, Android Basics, cloud fundamentals, tech entrepreneurship, deep learning, and more.

Google exec confirms premium-priced Pixel 2 Google Pixel 2 UK release date, price, spec rumours Google went from great-value smartphones to premium Android devices as it switched its phone line branding from Nexus to Pixel last October. So what’s in store for the next Google phone? We round up the Google Pixel 2 UK release date, price and specification rumours. It's been only a few months since the Pixel and Pixel XL became available, but there's already talk of a new Google phone By Marie Brewis | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments It seems insanely early to be talking about new Google phones, with the Pixel and Pixel XL having only gone on sale in October, but if there are rumours we will report them. It's important to point out that all the rumours in this article come via a single source of 9to5Google's editor Stephen Hall. We're not doubting the source's credibility, but pointing out the fact we have no other source to back up any of the information. Plus, at this stage in the proceedings, plans have a tendency to change - Google is reportedly only at the hardware testing of prototypes stage after all. Nevertheless, here's what we know about the next Google phone, the Google Pixel 2. Latest update: Google Senior Vice President of Hardware, Rick Osterloh, has confirmed that a Pixel 2 will arrive in 2017. "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it," Osterloh said. "You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now," Osterloh told Android Pit. Osterloh also said the Pixel 2 would retain its premium price. Also see: Google Pixel review and Google Pixel XL review Google Pixel 2 rumours: Will the next Google phone be a Nexus or a Pixel? Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's head of Android, told Bloomberg last October that while the company wasn't closing the door completely on Nexus it didn't currently have plans for any Nexus devices. Based on this alone we would suggest the next Google phone is a Pixel rather than a Nexus. Rick Osterloh, Google's Senior Vice President of Hardware, has also confirmed that the Pixel will get a successor in 2017. Google Pixel 2 rumours: Who will make the new Google phone? It's too early to know who will be making the Google Pixel 2, since we doubt Google has even made a final decision on that just yet. In the past we've seen Google phones manufactured by LG, HTC, Huawei, Samsung and Motorola. The maker of the new Google phone could be any of these partners, but equally it could be a brand-new hardware partner. We'll update this article when we know more. Google Pixel 2 UK release date rumours: When is the new Google phone coming out? We now know that Google I/O will be held 17-19 May 2017, during which time it will more than likely unveil a developer preview of its forthcoming Android operating system, Android O. This is important because the company has always used its annual phone releases as the launch vehicles for the final version of its latest operating system. Also see: How to install latest Android 7.1.2 Beta Allowing for a good few months of Android O betas prior to the final release, Google phones are traditionally unveiled in late-September/early-October. The current Pixel and Pixel XL were announced at a special event on 5 October 2016, and went on sale on 20 October. We'd expect a similar time frame for the Google Pixel 2. Google Pixel 2 UK price rumours: How much will the new Google phone cost? Rick Osterloh has confirmed that Pixel will retain its premium pricing in 2017. When it switched its phone line branding from Nexus to Pixel in 2016, Google moved away from high-value devices and toward more premium phones. The cheapest Pixel today costs £599, while the cheapest Pixel XL costs £719. 9to5Mac's source suggests we should expect at least a $50 increase on this due to improvements it is making to the camera and adding waterproofing. However, the same source also suggests Google is experimenting with a cheaper, lower-specified Pixel 2B that it hopes to launch at the same time or shortly after the Pixel 2 in emerging markets. If it goes ahead there is no guarantee we will see this cheaper Pixel in the UK. Google Pixel 2 specification rumours: What to expect from the new Google phone Through 9to5Google's source we know two key things about the upcoming Google Pixel 2: it will be waterproof, and it will feature an improved camera.  Hall tweeted in late-January that he recalled being told back in October that the next Google phone would be waterproof, and the fact the current model was not came down to an issue of time constraints, and the need to keep down costs. He says Google was forced to choose between upgrading the camera and making the Pixel waterproof. The current Pixel and Pixel XL are IP58 rated, which means they are dustproof and protected against spraying water, but not submersible or water-resistant. On the subject of the camera, Hall writes that his source has claimed the camera will be improved, not in terms of the megapixel count but in the number of extra features. Google particularly wants to focus on getting low-light photography right. The processor also gets a mention, and Google has apparently been testing models with both Snapdragon 835 and Intel chips, but has already ruled out cheaper brand MediaTek. The video shown at the top of this page is the latest creation from Concept Creators. It shows renders of what the Pixel 2 may look like, based on speculation and rumours, as well as some suggested specifications that are in line with what we might expect from a flagship phone arriving later this year. However, one interesting thing to note is the inclusion of a red Google Pixel 2. Does Google really have a red model planned, or is Concept Creator poking fun at its new Really Blue model with the idea of a Really Red model? Unfortunately we won't know until more leaks and rumours appear online. It does look pretty cool, though. We'll bring you more rumours about the Google Pixel 2 as we hear them.

Are you curious to know why as of today, I'm a Chromebook guy? Read More and I couldn’t be happier. The device itself is incredibly lightweight and portable yet robust with superb performance (Acer Chromebook 14 for Work in case you were wondering). It makes me want to work, which explains the huge boost to my overall productivity. Acer Chromebook for Work, 14" Full HD, Intel Core i5, 8GB Memory, 32GB Storage, Google Chrome, CP5-471-581N Acer Chromebook for Work, 14" Full HD, Intel Core i5, 8GB Memory, 32GB Storage, Google Chrome, CP5-471-581N 6th Generation Intel Core i5-6200U Processor 2.3GHz Buy Now At Amazon $600.00 Of course it hasn’t all been sunshine and rainbows, especially during the first week. The hardest part about switching to a Chromebook is that you can only install Chromebook apps Chromebooks Aren't Perfect - Working Around the Negatives Chromebooks Aren't Perfect - Working Around the Negatives Although we've recently published articles discussing Chromebook's inherent positives, it would be short-sighted to pretend that the devices are perfect and without flaws. Read More , so say goodbye to your favorite Windows- and Mac-only apps! But once you find and settle in with a few Chromebook app alternatives, you’ll feel right at home. If you’re reading this as someone who’s thinking of switching to Chromebook Everything You Need To Know About Switching To A Chromebook Everything You Need To Know About Switching To A Chromebook Chromebooks run a slimmed-down operating system optimized for getting on the web with just the Chrome browser and Chrome apps. Can you switch to a Chromebook? Read More but hasn’t yet, here’s what I think: Chromebooks fall short for specialized business or creative work, but they’re perfect for everyday tasks The Fundamental Advantages Of Using A Chromebook The Fundamental Advantages Of Using A Chromebook Chromebooks are highly divisive and a consensus about the merits of Google's offering is a long way from materialising. Here are the key advantages of using a Chromebook when compared to Windows and Macs. Read More like music, taking notes, surfing the web, documents and spreadsheets, etc. Check out the following apps to see if your needs can be fulfilled with a Chromebook. 1. Playing Music: Enjoy Since Chromebooks are designed to be used with web apps, the best thing would be to move your local music collection onto the cloud (which you can do with Google Play Music The 7 Best Google Play Music Features The 7 Best Google Play Music Features Is Google Play Music worth trying? Here are seven of the most compelling features you'll find within Google's streaming music service. Read More ), use your smartphone as your music player, or rely solely on streaming services like Spotify or Prime Music Amazon Prime vs. Netflix and Spotify Combined Amazon Prime vs. Netflix and Spotify Combined Streaming services are on the rise, so it's all about choosing wisely between them. In this article we ask, "Is Amazon Prime better than Netflix and Spotify combined?" Read More . I don’t recommend using a Chromebook for local music playback because most Chromebooks don’t come with much internal storage, so your device won’t be able to hold many songs anyway. But if you’re dead set on doing this, Enjoy Music Player is pretty much the only good option for it. One cool feature is that Enjoy can stream music from Google Drive, so that could be a good compromise for you. 2. Chat: All-in-One Messenger Whereas most activities tend to be harder on a Chromebook, chatting and messaging is actually easier thanks to this nifty app. With All-in-One, you can manage dozens of different messaging services in one place — no longer will you have to juggle several different tabs and windows. Popular services supported by All-in-One include WhatsApp, Skype, Slack, Steam, Discord, Telegram, Facebook, Yahoo, ICQ, and more. 3. Notes and To-Dos: Knotes If you need a heavy-duty note-taking solution, you can always resort to Evernote or OneNote. Both are at the top of their game and they both offer web versions that are pretty much on par with their Windows and Mac versions. I personally use OneNote for my big note collections. But for smaller notes and reminders, I use Knotes. This awesome app has everything going for it: super fast performance, clean and intuitive interface, as well as apps for Android and iOS for mobile access to your notes. It’s simple and it works. 4. Text Editing: Caret Chromebooks aren’t designed for intense programming so if you’re looking for a powerful text editor along the lines of Sublime Text, Atom Editor, or Visual Studio Code, you might as well stop now because you won’t be satisfied with anything you find. That being said, Caret works in a pinch. What’s nice about Caret is that it runs completely offline, which can’t be said for most Chromebook apps. It also has the fundamental makings of a serious text editor: tabbed editing, syntax highlighting, full-text search, project view, and a smart command palette. As long as you’re aware that it doesn’t do much more than that, you’ll be happy. I think it’s clear that Caret is the best text editor for Chromebooks Four Of The Best Text Editors For Your Chromebook Four Of The Best Text Editors For Your Chromebook Do you miss having a simple text editor on your Chromebook's OS? Although Google scrapped its native app, there are still alternatives available. Read More , but if you don’t like it for whatever reason, you should consider trying Material Neutron instead. 5. Distraction-Free Writing: Writer Chromebooks are awesome for writing, but the only downside is that you don’t have access to any of the excellent distraction-free writers available on Windows and Mac. The fact that I can’t use Scrivener or FocusWriter on my Chromebook is a real bummer. Hopefully one day… For now the closest thing is Writer, which actually isn’t that bad. It works offline so you can write anywhere and everywhere, its colors and fonts are themeable so you can personalize it to your pleasure, it supports word counts and writing goals, and the interface is perfectly minimal. The app is free but there’s a Pro version with extra features like exporting as an ebook, shareable stats and streaks, exporting to cloud storage, file revision histories, and more. 6. Image Editing: Pixlr Photoshop is the image editing king with GIMP coming in as a close second — neither are available on Chromebooks. And even if they were, most Chromebooks don’t have the hardware to support the heavy resource usage that both of them require, so it’d be a moot point for most users anyway. But there are plenty of image editors for Chromebooks Four Excellent Image Editors For Your Chromebook Four Excellent Image Editors For Your Chromebook Do you like editing and tweaking images but find the Chromebook's default editor too limited? Here are some alternatives. Read More , and the best of them is Pixlr. Most notable is the interface, which emulates the look and feel of Photoshop and GIMP. It also supports many of the features you’d expect including layers, filters, brush controls, cloning, spot healing, advanced adjustments, and more. It’s surprisingly good. 7. Torrenting: JSTorrent ($2.99) Didn’t think it was possible to torrent on a Chromebook, did you? I surely didn’t. But as it turns out, there’s a nifty JavaScript-based app called JSTorrent that can handle torrent downloads perfectly, and it works well on newer and older Chromebooks alike. And don’t think you need to be a pirate to make use of this app. There are many legal reasons for torrenting 8 Legal Uses For BitTorrent: You'd Be Surprised 8 Legal Uses For BitTorrent: You'd Be Surprised Like HTTP, which your browser uses to communicate with websites, BitTorrent is just a protocol. You could use your browser to download pirated content, just as you could use a BitTorrent client to download pirated... Read More and you should take advantage of them if you aren’t already. JSTorrent may not be as feature-rich as some Windows torrent clients Beat the Bloat! Try These Lightweight BitTorrent Clients Beat the Bloat! Try These Lightweight BitTorrent Clients Guns don’t share illegal files. People share illegal files. Or, wait, how does it go again? What I mean to say is, BitTorrent shouldn't be dissed based on its potential for piracy. Read More and Mac torrent clients 4 Transmission Alternatives for Mac BitTorrent Users 4 Transmission Alternatives for Mac BitTorrent Users Transmission was struck with malware twice in one year, so you might want to consider a new Mac torrent app. Read More , but it gets the job done. 8. Screen Capture: Clipular Chromebooks can take screenshots using two system-level keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl + Window Switcher captures the entire screen while Ctrl + Shift + Window Switcher captures a region of the screen according to your selection. These are fine, but what if you need a bit more power? Then Clipular might be for you. Similar to Greenshot and ShareX (on Windows) or Grab (on Mac), Clipular allows you to capture any portion of the screen, annotate it, auto-save to a location of your choice, sync with Google Drive, and one-click share to social media. A must-have app for anyone who takes frequent screenshots. What’s Missing That You Can’t Live Without? There are many Chromebook misconceptions floating around 5 Things You Didn't Know About Chromebooks, And Why You Might Want One 5 Things You Didn't Know About Chromebooks, And Why You Might Want One Here are 5 things you should know about Chromebooks if you're thinking of buying one. Read More , the worst one being that Chromebooks are too limited. That may have been true 2–3 years ago but is no longer the case now that web-based apps are more popular. The truth is, most average computer users are likely to be happier with a Chromebook than, say, a tablet or laptop of equal price. That being said, I’m fully aware that Chromebooks are not for everyone. If there’s a specific Windows or Mac app that you absolutely need, then now may not be the time for you to switch. Chromebooks can do a lot, but they still have a bit of catching up to do. How do you feel about Chromebooks? Are there any apps that you absolutely need before you can even think about switching?

With this update, when users apply one of the app’s “looks” to a photo, Google Photos will now correct the image’s white balance, in addition to its exposure and saturation. Google introduced the “looks” feature in Google Photos late last year. Users can choose from a variety of looks, which will alter a picture in numerous ways. Jingyu Cui, software engineer for Google Photos, explained looks in a November 2016 blog post: These unique looks make edits based on the individual photo and its brightness, darkness, warmth, or saturation, before applying the style. All looks use machine intelligence to complement the content of your photo, and choosing one is just a matter of taste. Auto white balance in looks is now rolling out to Google Photos users on Android and the web. The feature is coming soon to iOS. Elsewhere, Google shared six tips to help users improve their images.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 March 2017 by Military News San Mateo Home Care Company, NuevaCare Announces Upgrades to Google My Business Listing SAN MATEO, Calif., March 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — NuevaCare, a leading home care agency based in San Mateo, California, but serving Bay Area cities as diverse as Millbrae, Belmont, and Palo Alto, is excited to announce important upgrades to its Google My Business listing. Many potential clients use Google listings to evaluate home care providers when making an in-home care decision for themselves or loved ones. “The Bay Area is full of tech savvy consumers who love sites like Google and Yelp,” explained Kamran Nasser, CEO of NuevaCare. “By upgrading our Google My Business listing, we are making it easy for potential clients to learn about us on the Google platform.” To view the upgraded Google listing, visit https://plus.google.com/+NuevaCareSanMateo. Interested parties can also view the listing directly on Google at https://goo.gl/bPTq5L. Related to this update, the company has upgraded its San Mateo home care page at http://nuevacare.com/san-mateo-home-care/ Among the information upgrades to the Google My Business Page are the following. First, on the related Google+ page, the company has increased the frequency of posts about its blog, as well as relevant local events and information to San Mateo and nearby communities like Palo Alto and Millbrae. Second, the Google reviews (available on Google and connected on the backend to Google+) are visible directly on Google search not only for the brand name but, increasingly, for relevant search terms such as home care, caregivers, and in-home care where consumers are comparing and contrasting competing providers. Third, the company has beefed up its blogging and other social media activity, not only on Google+ but also on other venues such as Twitter or Facebook that can feed into local performance. Questions and Answers on Home Care Consumers today are likely to go, first, to online sites such as Google, Facebook, and Yelp to learn about home care services. Next, they tend to compare and contrast providers, looking not only at reviews but also on the company websites as well as blogs, reviews, etc. Issues that can come up include the types of assistance that are available, including 24 hour live-in care, hourly care, personal care including bathing, dressing, etc., as well as medication reminders and other non-medical assistance on an as-needed basis. However, persons with an active need for San Mateo home care (or home care in nearby cities) are encouraged to reach out for a consultation. No two clients are the same, and NuevaCare will configure its caregiver services to the needs of the individual and his or her family. The newly updated pages should be considered a first step towards learning about caregiver services, and comparing possible providers. About NuevaCare A premier technology based home care company based in San Mateo and servicing the San Francisco Bay Area, NuevaCare delivers responsive, quality, and affordable in-home care to those who need care due to old age or recovering from surgery or illness. NuevaCare services clients in diverse Bay Area cities from Burlingame to Santa Clara, San Mateo to Palo Alto, Foster City to Hillsborough and everywhere in between.
