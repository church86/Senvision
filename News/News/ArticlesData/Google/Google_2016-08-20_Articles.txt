Your days of woe may be coming to an end, thanks to a new developer update that lets you unlock Chrome OS with nothing more than a PIN. “This will definitely come in handy for touch devices,” wrote Google employee Francois Beaufort in a Google+ post. The experimental feature is being tested in the latest Google Developer update. “All you have to do is enable the flag chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin, restart Chrome, and go to Chrome Material Design settings page for now to set up your Lock Screen PIN in the new ‘Screen Lock’ section,” Beaufort continued. “When it’s done, lock your screen…and enjoy the new experience!” As OMG! Chrome reports, the update comes as part of the most recent Canary Build for the Chrome operating system, and it does away with the pesky task of inputting a potentially long and difficult Google account password every time users try to unlock their computer. Of course, it’s only to unlock a computer — logins and boot ups will still require the entire password. The new PIN option adds a third possibility to the current methodologies, which at present include just the entire Google account password or a paired smartphone. Those wanting to dig deeper should check out the source code here. Seeing as the feature is purely experimental for the time being, there’s still a chance that Google could make a few more tweaks to the system, perhaps making it even easier to use. So if you’re tired of typing in a long alphanumeric password just to get into your Chromebook or Chrome OS, you’re finally looking at a solution.

Join a chat He went on to note quick lock will soon come to the regular Chrome settings page. This comes after Google decided to kill off Chrome apps for non Chrome OS machines, signaling it’s narrowing Chrome’s focus to its core audience, which is probably a healthier choice than trying to make everything a Chromebook.

Industry > Industry monitor > Telecom More reports on: Apple, Google Apple, Google join hands to strike at Robocallers news 20 August 2016 More than 30 tech leaders including Google parent Alphabet, Apple and telecom service providers have joined hands to crack down on automated phone calls, Reuters reported. The "Robocall Strike Force," a group led by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), held its first hearing on the subject in Washington DC on Friday. Both prerecorded messages from misleading phone numbers and automated text messages. The FCC has roped in companies like Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, AT&T, and Verizon in an effort to end the nuisance of unsolicited calls playing prerecorded messages from advertisers including big corporations. "We know there is a problem. We know how much consumers dislike these calls," said FCC commissioner Mignon L Clyburn. "We know the public is frustrated, because they assumed that after they registered for the 'Do Not Call' list, this would stop. It did not, so now it is time to take some real action." The strike force is expected to submit its report to the FCC by 19th October with "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, who is the chairman of the coalition. These solutions could take the form of Caller ID verification standards capable of blocking spoofed phone numbers, as also a list of numbers from government agencies and banks that telemarketers would not be able to spoof. The strike force would report to the FCC by 19 Ocotober on "concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions," SReuters reported. "This scourge must stop," Wheeler said yesterday calling robocalls the No 1 complaint from consumers. "The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology," FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue "due in large part to industry inaction."  search domain-b    go Legal Policy | Copyright © 1999-2016 The Information Company Private Limited.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Google to start sunsetting Chrome Apps this year By Juha Saarinen on Aug 22, 2016 9:30AM Developers told to migrate to the web. Google will start phasing out apps for Chrome just three years after they were introduced in an effort to simplify the web browser. Chrome Apps was launched in 2013 as a way to overcome limitations in web browsers, such as the inability to work offline without a network connection, sending notifications, and directly accessing hardware on users' computers. However the web giant now says Chrome Apps will be deprecated and no longer supported. Starting late 2016, newly-published Chrome applications will only be made available to Chrome OS user, and not for the Chrome web browser, Google vice-president of product management Rahul Roy-Chowdhury said. The apps will disappear from view in the Chrome web store in the second half of next year, and by early 2018 Apple MacOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux Chrome users will no longer be able to load the apps. By then, Google expects developers to have migrated their Chrome Apps to the web or to have replaced them with browser extensions. If developers cannot fully migrate their apps to the web, they can help prioritise new application programming interfaces for the Chrome web browser to fill gaps left by the apps. In short term, developers can use Chrome browser extensions, or platforms such as Electron or NW.js, Google said. Chrome Apps appear to have failed to capture users' interest. Roy-Chowdhury said just one percent of Chrome on Windows, Mac and Linux users are actively using the packaged apps. This is despite the popularity of the Chrome browser, which some analysts such as Netmarketshare estimate has over half of the global market with hundreds of millions of users and vendors such as Microsoft creating Chrome Apps versions of some of its Office productivity suite components. Google has not published figures on how many developers, apps and downloads its web store has seen recently. In 2012, the now-chief executive of Google who was then in charge of Chrome, Sundar Pichai, said users had installed over 750 million apps from the web store. Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (5) Post your comment Best Apps and Games of the Week 21 August, 2016 Duo Google finally released its new video calling app Duo on Android as well as iOS. Unlike Hangouts, Duo does not require a Google account and can be activated using just your mobile numbers. Once you set it up, you can see all your contacts who are using Duo within the app and you click on them to start a video call, and it's as simple as that. One of the unique features about Duo is Knock Knock, where you see the other person even before you pick up the call. Duo is by far the simplest and easiest video calling app out there right now. iOS  Android BBC Colouring: Doctor Who BBC Colouring is the official coloring app by BBC based around the popular television show Doctor Who. The app features 45 images for you to color any way you want. Great if you're an adult who's a fan of the show or a child who wants to color images. iOS  Android Deux Ex GO After making the excellent Hitman GO and Lara Croft GO, Square Enix is back with yet another version of yet another popular gaming franchise, Deus Ex. Called Deux Ex GO, the game features the familiar turn based puzzle gameplay with plenty of new mechanics and over 50 challenging levels to play through. If you loved the previous two games then you will love this one as well, even if you haven't played any Deux Ex game before. iOS  Android Linia Linia is a puzzle game where you have to draw a straight line through shapes of different colors to match a pattern of color specified above. You have to be precise in making sure the line touches exactly the colors in the exact order you are supposed to. To make matters more difficult, the shapes constantly move around. This is one of the tougher games you will play and requires some level of patience. iOS  Android It's A Space Thing It's A Space Thing is an old school 2D action arcade game where you have to shoot your enemies from behind shields that you create. Like you, your enemies can also create a shield for themselves that can be destroyed. The ammo gets used up quickly and you have to wait for a few seconds before it replenishes. The game features fast paced gameplay and retro graphics and sound. There is a two player mode as well but it can only be played on the same device and is more suitable on a tablet. iOS  Android Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

As a former resident of London before and after the 2012 Games I would say this statement needs to be taken with a VERY LARGE pinch of salt. The people of Rio seem to be on the same page and the round of applause is pretty much non-existent as he rattles out his empty claptrap. There is, however, a big cheer for the volunteers, as there should be.

Our own Owen Gibson is at the stadium: “Unfortunate scenes as the green pipe through which Super Mario jumped (who turned out to be the Japanese prime minister in disguise) gets stuck in the centre of the field of play as the speeches begin. Several minutes later a gang of stagehands have finally managed to wheel it off.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.01pm EDT 21:01 Please let Ryan Lochte put out the Olympic flame by urinating on it.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.57pm EDT 20:57 The Tokyo instillation has lots of interesting lights.

But now he’s turned into Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister. There’s lots of 3D holograms dropping into the stadium now. It’s pretty impressive stuff and is messing with my head slightly.

Maybe for the Olympics, who knows? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.51pm EDT 20:51 Thomas Bach lets the governor of Tokyo wave the flag now. This is a new Olympic flag not the one that was marched off by soldiers. If your city pays $8bn it too gets to wave the flag! And now the Japanese national anthem is sung - the second best national anthem behind the French. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.49pm EDT 20:49 Emma John It’s all got to the sententious, pseudo-patriotic part of the ceremony - all that business with the flag, and soldiers marching to a background of stirring choral music, and feeling transported to a weird fascist state where everyone has to love sport or they’re taken outside and shot. Bet Stella McCartney’s really regretting those flashing shoes right now. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.48pm EDT 20:48 Something’s happening. I think this is the bit they hand the flag over to the next country to host the Games. Hooray! We’re near the end! There are kids singing. The Olympic flag is being marched off by soldiers - maybe to Japan. Or maybe to prison. Who knows? Maybe a story worth looking into.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.26pm EDT 20:26 Some dancers dressed as clay figures - or are they clay figures dressed as dancers? - are now entertaining us with some clay dancing. Clay isn’t good in the rain, right? They take people off at the French Open when it rains. You can hurt your knees and stuff. Let’s hope those little clay guys are OK out there. Stay safe clay people! Here’s Emma John: “In keeping with the overall theme of attendance at these Olympics, even the ATHLETES’ seating in the centre of the arena is at least a quarter empty! They’ve clearly put out way too many chairs, like an optimistic amateur pianist at a recital they organised themselves.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.20pm EDT 20:20 Emma John We’ve now reached the “lacemaking” stage of the evening. I’ll be honest, this is the bit I was most ready to laugh at when I read it in the programme. But it’s actually the most powerful segment so far: really moving and empassioned singing from a group of traditional singers from Salvador and accompanied by a rather lovely and hypnotic light show. It’s got the biggest response of the evening so far in the stadium. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.19pm EDT 20:19 We’ve gone back from the invention of techno in the 1980s to the history of lace in 19th century Brazil now. Lace is really good for projecting on to arena floors because of all the geometric shapes. It is also a reference that people like to stare at geometric shapes at the end of a night out at a techno club.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.13pm EDT 20:13 In our tour through history, techno has just been invented so we’ve zoomed up from pre-history to 1988. This is good news. And now dancers spell out “Rio 2016”, they’ve skipped the mesozoic era completely. Shoddy. On a more serious note, Dennis Warren emails in: “This prehistoric bit is to celebrate the Capivara national park, which has the largest collection of prehistoric art in Latin America. It’s just had its fundng stopped by the interim government.” Updated at 8.16pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.12pm EDT 20:12 Not good news for people who wanted an early night. We are now exploring Brazil’s history, starting in PREHISTORIC times. Which lasted ages - like 14 years or something.

That means the athletes are all here. Or if they’re not, they can wait out in the car park.

The feature was officially launched in July and has made life much easier for those trying to share your favorite apps with family and friends, without the need of spending extra money. Image courtesy of Android Authority In an effort to thank those who have already signed up, Google began a promotion that would take 50% off any movie rental from Google Play Movies. Users must already be signed up for Family Library in order to take advantage of this pretty awesome promo. It also seems that this deal isn’t readily available if you are part of the program as it requires an email code to be used. This offer lasts until August 31st, so if you’re already a member of Google Play Family Library, exercise a bit of patience.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Google sued for data-mining students’ email 18 Mar 2014 28 Google, Law & order, Privacy Post navigation Previous: Security Essentials: What is PCI DSS? Next: Whatsapp’s Jan Koum says privacy won’t suffer with Facebook acquisition by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Google is in hot water for scanning millions of students’ email messages and allegedly building “surreptitious” profiles to target advertising at them. According to Education Week, a “potentially explosive” lawsuit is wending its way through US federal court, now being heard in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. In court filings, plaintiffs charge that Google data-mines Gmail users – a group that includes students who use the company’s Apps for Education tool suite. Of course it’s not news that Google reads the emails in its users’ inboxes. The consumer Gmail product is free and pays its way with targeted advertising. The targeting is done by building up profiles of users’ interests based on the content of their email. The situation is a little muddier when it comes to Apps for Education. Apps for Education is used by K-12 schools and institutions of higher education throughout the world for free online applications such as email, calendar, word processing, spreadsheet and collaborative document sharing. Google admitted to Education Week that it automatically “scans and indexes” the email of Apps for Education users even though ads are off by default. A company spokeswoman said that Google does so in order to provide features such as virus protection, spelling checks, and Gmail’s “priority inbox”. She also said that Google doesn’t process information stored in Google Drive, Docs, or other applications in Apps for Education. Its automated processes can’t actually be turned off, Google said, even for users who choose not to receive ads. The company wouldn’t say whether the scans are used to build user profiles, but Bram Bout, the director of Google Apps for Education, said in a statement that the education suite’s ads are turned off by default: ...ads in Gmail are turned off by default for Google Apps for Education and we have no plans to change that in the future. The thing is, Google’s own court filings in the California suit contradict Bout’s assertion that his employer doesn’t use data mining to target ads to Apps for Education users unless they opt to receive them, according to student-data-privacy experts, Education Week reports. Khaliah Barnes, a lawyer with the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), told the education news outlet that the case is troubling: This should draw the attention of the U.S. Department of Education, the Federal Trade Commission, and state legislatures. ... Student privacy is under attack. Nine plaintiffs, including two students who’ve used the suite, are accusing Google of violating federal and state anti-wiretapping law and hope to turn the case into a class action suit. The plaintiffs allege that Google violated the Wiretap Act, which prohibits the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications. The lawsuit actually rolls up a hodgepodge of seven individual and class action cases brought against Google, including those brought against the company for scanning messages sent from non-Gmail users. The suit maintains that, because such non-Gmail users who send emails to Gmail users never signed on to Google’s terms of services, they can never have given, in Google’s terms, “implied consent” to scan their email. The plaintiffs are seeking payouts for millions of Gmail users. The financial damages would amount to $100 per day of each day of violation for every individual who sent or received an email message using Google Apps for Education during a two-year period beginning in May 2011. The plaintiffs also want Google to be more transparent around its data-mining practices.

Reply Guy says: March 18, 2014 at 2:52 pm Anyone who emails a Gmail address knows that their emails are going to get scanned. C’mon – get real. And what difference does it make anyway? Google isn’t the NSA. Reply LuckyLuigi says: March 18, 2014 at 4:08 pm NSA has direct access to Google data, no requests or anything needed, so by default Google IS the NSA. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 5:32 pm No. Holy hell, no. The NSA may have access to Google’s data, but I sincerely doubt that Google has access to all of the NSA’s data. So saying “The NSA IS Google” *might* have a grain of truth to it (even though it’s a pretty big exaggeration), but saying that “Google IS the NSA” is ridiculous. Reply Elias rufus says: August 21, 2016 at 6:19 pm Google is the NSA, but the NSA is not Google. It’s a subset. This is much like stating Humans are animals, animals are not humans. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 4:30 pm You’re a bright one, aren’t you? Reply Nicolas Edwards says: March 18, 2014 at 4:34 pm The diffrence is that for acadimics we don’t get to choose what email service our univeristy uses. We also do a lot of research that has us sign non-disclosure agreements. Seems google is looking to steal peoples ideas. Reply brianc6234 says: March 18, 2014 at 5:23 pm If that’s a problem the schools shouldn’t use Gmail. It’s their fault. For years if you use Gmail you should know they see what’s in your email. Schools can always have their own email servers. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 5:45 pm No, because then it would be clearly documented that you had begun research before their organization. Reply H says: March 18, 2014 at 6:02 pm Google isn’t trying to steal anything… mfw. Building an advertising profile might get them in trouble, but for a lot of things it HAS to index and scan your email. EVERY email client will do that. Scanning/indexing your email is how the search works, it’s how virus scans work, spam protection, etc. Reply roxy says: March 19, 2014 at 3:50 am i’m sorry bud, but google is not actually trying to steal your thesis about how kerouac was like, a guy or whatever you have in there. Reply 2072 says: March 18, 2014 at 4:37 pm It’s true that I prefer my emails to be unsafe with Google than unsafe with the NSA as Google has no actual ‘power’ on individuals contrary to the NSA which can destroy an innocent individual’s life if it choose so based on alleged ‘proofs’ gathered through their dubious spying techniques… That being said I’d prefer my emails to be just safe from other human eyes or unknown ‘social algorithms’. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 5:13 pm My school uses Gmail as the backbone or whatever. When I login to my schools email it IS gmail. Although if you emailed me you would be emailing the school.edu email address.. so you wouldn’t know you’re sending it to googles servers…. c’mon – get real. Reply Ian says: March 19, 2014 at 4:53 am The point is that schools require students to use Apps for Education. Everyone knows that emails are scanned, but Edu users are unique because they are legally obligated to use google services and they don’t have the opprotunity to click “decline.” Reply Wrap2tyt says: March 19, 2014 at 2:39 pm “And what difference does it make anyway? Google isn’t the NSA”… no, but they are getting rich(er). Reply Casual Friday says: December 4, 2014 at 11:54 pm Just because third party doctrine is applicable in court proceedings does not automatically give that right to a corporation. It’s a violation of trust and disgrace on a grand scale. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 3:46 pm Exactly they are worse then the NSA since the NSA protects its citizens from harm where Google does not care to protect you at all…they just want to market fromyou. Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 8:28 pm “…the NSA protects its citizens from harm…” How’s the weather in your fantasy world? Reply 2072 says: March 18, 2014 at 4:22 pm hmmm that’s an interesting problem but I perceive Google legitimacy in doing so… They HAVE to scan and analyse received emails for several reasons: – Spam detection – Virus detection – Search indexing (it needs to build an index of terms in order to allow searching through received and sent emails…) – Importance classification (‘Priority Inbox’ that works as the opposite of spam detection) – user filtering (the different automatic filters user configure themselves). Moreover the above reasons don’t only apply to Google, ALL email providers need to scan incoming emails just to detect Virus and Spam… Reply Jack says: March 18, 2014 at 4:40 pm You have to believe NSA works directly with companies like Google… Reply PDXTony says: March 18, 2014 at 5:52 pm is this really a shock? The internet is not a guarantee of privacy. If people haven’t figured that out yet they are just being naive. (never made public email on blogs. sure but its stored right?) Google tells people up front that it will scan the information and makes assessments automatically based on that info , along with that comes spell check, search functions, etc. people want free for free and that is just not reality. I trust a private company that tells me they are doing something than the current garbage thats going on with the CIA and NSA. There will always be people that fear the worst could happen, I just tend to ignore them and I am much happier Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 6:24 pm Understand no entity or individual has the right to scan personal information period. corporations and governments are just people like you and I. There are some very outstanding people out there as well as some very unscrupulous individuals and they are at every level and all walks of life. Also realize it is a free service so you do have a vote, do not use the service if you feel uncomfortable with it. If your school administration is buying into it then the issue is with them not the provider. I do not particularly care for Google either but it is a free enterprise and if people would stop complaining and stand up for their rights through their actions (do not use and recommend to others not to use it), I think we would be better off. Regarding the NSA… people get the government they deserve, right? Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 6:53 pm Any email service that features a search function scans the content of emails that are sent and received regardless of who it was sent by. Additionally the data mining and scanning functions are outlined in the commercial agreement documents that the educational institutions would of agreed to. By proxy when the student agreed to the schools services agreement for access to school computer networks they likely agreed to any agreements the school had made with the service providers. I think this lawsuit is ridiculous and to illustrate my point the students likely didn’t agree to the network shaping techniques the schools ISP uses yet have probably used it to access all sorts of personal information, should they be allowed to sue them as well for violation of wire tap laws? Reply Anonymous says: March 18, 2014 at 8:40 pm Is this a news story or an advertisement for SOPHOS? I’m confused. Reply Paul Ducklin says: March 18, 2014 at 9:22 pm Do you mean is this site “an advert for Sophos” because it’s Sophos Naked Security, and the site’s pages clearly say so? Not sure how the story itself might be an advert for our products, other than that it’s about email, and we happen to sell a range of email security products for on-site, off-site and cloud-based use…but then, because we have a range of email security products, topics to do with email and privacy are of interest to us. Reply Jim says: March 19, 2014 at 7:17 pm EVERY email system scans the emails. It’s impossible not to unless the mail is encrypted. Unless you encrypt your email, it WILL be read. Many times (once for each relay server and a couple more for good measure). Further, schools are using GMail for one main reason: Cost. They’re saving money. When they made that choice they accepted certain consequences. So, any lawsuit should be against the school, not Google.

Reuters Corning responds to that worrying Galaxy Note 7 scratch test video You've likely seen the video: Zack from JerryRigEverything performing his now-familiardurability test on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Surprisingly, he appears to leave visible scratches on the device's Gorilla Glass 5 with a metal pick that rates a 3 on Mohs scale of hardness -- "only one step above plastic," as Zack notes in the video. A new glass from Corning that appears to scratch much more easily than its predecessor is admittedly hot news, but as is often the case, the "scandal" may have gotten blown a little out of proportion. Android Authority Nasa just made all its research available online for free Care to learn more about 400-foot tsunamis on Mars? Now you can, after Nasa announced it is making all its publicly funded research available online for free.

Independent | NASA SLAC, Stanford gadget grabs more solar energy to disinfect water faster In many parts of the world, the only way to make germy water safe is by boiling, which consumes precious fuel, or by putting it out in the sun in a plastic bottle so ultraviolet rays will kill the microbes. But because UV rays carry only 4 percent of the sun’s total energy, the UV method takes six to 48 hours, limiting the amount of water people can disinfect this way. Now researchers at the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University have created a nanostructured device, about half the size of a postage stamp, that disinfects water... Stanford The gif is dead. long live the gif. November 5, 1999, was Burn All GIFs Day. Had you visited its homepage that Friday, you would have seen the movement's game plan laid out as plainly as its name: "On Burn All GIFs Day, all GIF users will gather at Unisys and burn all their GIF files." This, alongside a selection of pointedly anti-GIF imagery -- all proudly PNG files. Despite the obvious joke of setting files on fire, acknowledged with a winking plea to "extinguish all GIFs before leaving the vicinity," the anger was real and the mission was earnest... Popular Mechanics Eleven reasons to be excited about the future of technology In the year 1820, a person could expect to live less than 35 years, 94% of the global population lived in extreme poverty, and less that 20% of the population was literate. Today, human life expectancy is over 70 years, less that 10% of the global population lives in extreme poverty, and over 80% of people are literate. These improvements are due mainly to advances in technology, beginning in the industrial age and continuing today in the information age. Medium Books you should read: Basic electronics I learned some basic electronics in high school physics class: resistors, capacitors, Kirchoff’s law and such, and added only what was required for projects as I did them. Then around 15 years ago I decided to read some books to flesh out what I knew and add to my body of knowledge. It turned out to be hard to find good ones. The electronics section of my bookcase has a number of what I’d consider duds, but also some gems. Hackaday The World Series of hacking -- without humans On a raised floor in a ballroom at the Paris Hotel, seven competitors stood silently. These combatants had fought since 9:00am, and nearly $4 million in prize money loomed over all the proceedings. Now some 10 hours later, their final rounds were being accompanied by all the play-by-play and color commentary you'd expect from an episode of American Ninja Warrior. Yet, no one in the competition showed signs of nerves. Ars Technica "I want to write video games" Do you? Do you really? Be honest with me. I mean, I don't want to shoot down your dream. There are lots of people who've done the research, who know exactly what they're getting into when they say this, and who spend years earnestly pursuing their goal. There are also lots of people who like the notion of getting into game development but figure they'll never have any real skills like programming or art so this is their best bet. Medium People ignore software security warnings up to 90 percent of the time Software developers listen up: if you want people to pay attention to your security warnings on their computers or mobile devices, you need to make them pop up at better times. A new study from BYU, in collaboration with Google Chrome engineers, finds the status quo of warning messages appearing haphazardly -- while people are typing, watching a video, uploading files, etc. -- results in up to 90 percent of users disregarding them. Phys.org Your Tesla is watching you -- whether or not you're watching the road In the wake of Tesla's first recorded autopilot crash, automakers are reassessing the risk involved with rushing semi-autonomous driving technology into the hands of distractible drivers. But another aspect of autopilot—its ability to hoover up huge amounts of mapping and "fleet learning" data -- is also accelerating the auto industry's rush to add new sensors to showroom-bound vehicles.

Gadgets 3 0 0 August 21, 2016 Android 7.0 Nougat Release Date: Telus’ Huawei Nexus 6P, LG Nexus 5X Getting Google’s New OS Tomorrow, August 22? Venus Montalbo It seems like the highly-anticipated Android 7.0 Nougat release may still be happening this August. Except for the “later this summer” release time-frame, Google has not yet officially provided a specific launch schedule for the major Android iteration. The only recent hint for a possible launch schedule was from a tweet posted by Evan Blass, a famous tech tipster. He said that Android 7.0 Nougat will have an August release. Android 7.0 releases next month, with the 8/5 security patch. Sorry Nexus 5 owners, no Nougat for you ???? — Evan Blass (@evleaks) July 30, 2016 Considering the release date (July 18) of the last developer preview for the Google OS, an educated prediction was then made by 9to5Google saying that the Android 7.0 Nougat would probably be released mid-August. And since it’s already the second half of the month, it is most likely that enthusiastic Android fans, by this time, are already waiting for any news regarding Android Nougat’s release. Fortunately, a new sign that the new OS is possibly releasing this month popped up via Telus, a Canadian carrier. As reported by GSM Arena, a software update list from the telecom company noted that the Huawei Nexus 6 and LG Nexus 5X are set to receive the Android 7.0 Nougat update starting this Monday, August 22. For those too excited to experience the upcoming Android version, an option to go for is the developer preview released for Nougat. Last month, Google released the Developer Preview 5 for Android 7.0 Nougat and it is the last one before the firmware’s public launch. It is available for the following devices: Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, General Mobile 4G (Android One), and Pixel C. Android Nougat DP5 contains improvements, bug fixes and pre-installed apps. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOuxpKXrruI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The final Android Nougat Developer Preview also contains bug fixes, enhancements as well as pre-installed apps. It added: “Developer Preview 5 includes near-final system images for supported devices and the Android emulator. The images include the final APIs (API level 24) for the upcoming Android N platform. When you are done testing, you can publish apps using API level 24 to Google Play, in alpha, beta, and production release channels.” To access the final beta update before the official public release of the Nougat OS, Android users should be a member of the Android Beta program first. Meanwhile, Samsung Galaxy Note 7, the newest smartphone available in the market today, is also expected to get Android 7.0 Nougat. But Samsung recently revealed that the Nougat update for the Galaxy Note 7 will arrive in “two to three months,” as reported by Korea Times. And if this will pan out, Note 7 owners should be getting Google’s newest mobile OS as early as October or in November. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) “It is very important for us to offer up-to-date information with the new OS, but what’s more crucial is to build a stable and seamless platform for users,” Koh Dong-jin, president of the mobile communications division for Samsung Electronics, also shared. “That’s why we are planning to do enough beta testing before any OS updates.” As for other devices getting Android 7.0 Nougat, LG V20 is reportedly going to be the first third-party smartphone arriving with the new OS at launch, Techno Buffalo noted. Moreover, HTC’s Nexus Marlin and Nexus Sailfish, expected to have Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, are rumored for a fall 2016 release. The official name for Android 7.0 N – Nougat—was revealed by Google on July 1 after asking internet users to submit their ideas for it. The forthcoming mobile OS is anticipated to highlight new features such as the multi-window support as well as improvements on the battery-saving Doze mode. Introducing #AndroidNougat.

Modern Readers Breaking World, Tech, Sports, Business News Business Life Sports Technology World Viral November 23, 2016 Robocalls crackdown features strange Apple and Google alliance and more August 22, 2016 By Lorenzo Tanos We know Apple and Google to be among the fiercest rivals in the world of tech, not to mention two of the most powerful. Now they’re teaming up for a greater good, which is to help get rid of robocalls once and for all. And it’s not just those two, as there are many other big-name companies seemingly out for some robocall blood. Robocalls, or automated phone calls, have come a long way since the days of “Happy Dude” – once again, this writer is referencing an old Simpsons episode here. They’re more cloying and annoying than ever, and they deprive people of some much-deserved peace of mind. Worse, like Happy Dude, they often end up cheating people out of their hard-earned money. But consumers are almost always cheated out of more than just a single dollar when it comes to these phone calls. However, a number of companies, including tech titans Apple and Google, aren’t going to take them sitting down anymore. Apple and Google’s parent Alphabet are just two of the thirty-plus companies in the Robocall Strike Force, an all-star coalition captained by the Federal Communications Commission. These rock stars of the tech and telecommunications spaces are dogged in their desire to fight robocalls, which may also  include automated text messages on top of the usual pre-recorded voice messages from unscrupulous individuals looking to make a quick buck out of gullible recipients. “We know there is a problem. We know how much consumers dislike these calls,” said FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn in a statement. “We know the public is frustrated, because they assumed that after they registered for the ‘Do Not Call’ list, this would stop. It did not, so now it is time to take some real action.” Similarly, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler referred to robocalls as a “scourge,” and mentioned that over half of his agency’s help center tickets in the first half of 2016 were related to these calls. In another set of quotes, AT&T CEO and Robocall Strike Force chairman Randall Stephenson said that the coalition is expected to furnish “concrete plan to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions” by October 19. It isn’t exactly sure what these tools and solutions may be, but they may include new Caller ID verification paradigms that could prevent telemarketers and the like from spoofing telephone numbers, or “Do Not Spoof” lists straight from financial institutions and government agencies.

They call about my Google business local listings, about my not being on the first page of Google search results, and so on -- and they want me to pay them to "fix" this stuff.

Negative. NONE of these calls are from Google. Zero. Zilch. Nada. These callers are inevitably "SEO"; (Search Engine Optimization) scammers of one sort or another. They make millions of "cold calls" to businesses using public phone listings (from the Web or other sources) or using phone number lists purchased from brokers.

Then some time in march I got a call from someone who claimed to be calling from my Telco/ISP [phone and internet service via the same provider] and who began by telling me they would prove their identity by quoting me the Customer Account Number that is only printed on the paper copy of my quarterly statement. Funny old thing, it was the *right* number. I went through a lengthy and convoluted process to get the Police to give me a crime number and then contacted a UK part of my telco [not trusting their India Call Centre] and to my surprise, [having got passed the bored tekkie] and having explained that the only explanation for this disclosure would have been if there were a criminal or criminals working within the Telco themselves, I suggested that they might want to check their records and determine who had access my client account information in the preceding 30 days... The calls stopped, dead. I mean, not one since then. The *only* explanation I can offer is that all the criminals calls I was receiving were actually being made by a rogue unit, working inside my telco and using my telco's own phone lines and equipment, to scam UK clients...

Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple’s apps. Google recently underscored that strategy with the release of its latest mobile app: Duo, a video-calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple’s FaceTime. The app fits squarely into Google’s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple’s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones. Duo is no exception. People can use FaceTime only to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, increasing the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation. “You shouldn’t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,” Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. All this feeds into Google’s strategy to attract iPhone users to Android. Google’s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google’s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple. I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable. A short history First, a little context about Duo and where it fits into the universe of Google apps. Google announced in May at its annual developer conference that Duo would be coming. The app is solely dedicated to video chats between two people, the company said, to make video calling simpler to do. This is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact. Duo vs FaceTime The Duo app is downloadable and free through Google’s Play store and Apple’s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call. Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures. With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone’s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered. I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, the picture quality can be expected to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds. Against the rest I also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft’s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo’s simplicity won hands down. In Facebook’s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake. On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger’s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronise your address book with Skype. The bottom line For now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo, so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users. But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo’s single-button approach.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Railways will collaborate with Google for digitizing and showcasing its heritage on digital platforms. Google has agreed to partner with Railways to digitise its heritage assets and help create a digital repository for universal online access free of cost, said a senior Railway Ministry official. Indian Railway has a huge list of heritage assets including bridges, steam locos, buildings, artefacts and museums which can be showcased for global audience. An agreement in this regard will be signed soon between National Rail Museum and Google Cultural Institute (GCI). GCI is a non-profit organisation that partners with cultural organisations to bring world's cultural heritage online. GCI builds online tools and offers them to institutions for showcasing and sharing cultural assets. The official said collaboration will not only make NRM accessible online and offer virtual tours but also help digitise the national transporter's entire heritage inventory which includes more than 20 museums, hundreds of steam locos, coaches, station buildings, bridges among others. "Once these are placed online, it will act as a great tourist attraction," he said. GCI generally works with government organisations and not for profit groups to provide digital collection management systems and storeytelling tools free of cost. Various ministries and institutes of the government have already collaborated with GCI for displaying and preserving India's cultural heritage digitally. Currently Google is working with the railways in providing free Wi-Fi service at 100 stations. Indian Railway is preparing a comprehensive conservation management plan to preserve and promote its heritage assets.

Live feed Show 4.41pm EDT 16:41 Thanks for following the liveblog ... especially those who didn’t duck out when the lead got up to 41. The final sporting event of the 2016 Rio Olympics is over. The U.S. takes its 45th gold medal and 120th overall medal. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.39pm EDT 16:39 An emotional Carmelo Anthony announced that this was the last Olympics of his career, adding: “Despite everything that’s going on in our country, we gotta be united.” Anthony has said he wants to be a leader in the latter stage of his career, and he is clearly taking it seriously. Team USA may not need a 36-year old Anthony as a player in 2020, but they’ll miss his experience and emotion. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.36pm EDT 16:36 It was no secret that the U.S. struggled, or at least fell short of expectations in the group stage, but they played their best game of the tournament with the gold medal on the line. When the U.S. doesn’t play its best, other international teams can threaten them. But when they’re clicking, there’s still not another country that can get close. It’s hard to take any other conclusion from a 30-point win in a gold medal game. The U.S. has won gold. They’ll enter Tokyo in 2020 as the heavy favorites again. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.31pm EDT 16:31 Final: USA has won Gold in Men's Basketball The U.S. wins its third consecutive gold and now has six of seven since NBA players were allowed into the Olympics in 1992. Serbia had a poor performance today, but they have to be happy with the outcome of their Rio performance: a 4-4 team record netted them their second Olympic men’s basketball silver. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.29pm EDT 16:29 USA 96-64 Serbia, 0:40 4th quarter The U.S. won’t get the record for biggest margin in a gold medal game. It also looks like they’ll be “held” under 100 points. If you knew that entering the game, you’d guess this one would be very close. (Note: If you’re late to the liveblog, this game is not close.) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.25pm EDT 16:25 USA 92-57 Spain, 2:13 4th quarter Important note: Harrison Barnes is in the game. The gold medal is clinched. Carmelo Anthony was also put back in the game and was then removed again to a nice ovation. This may be his last Olympics and he’ll go down as one of the greatest Team USA players in history. Updated at 4.27pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.22pm EDT 16:22 USA 88-49 Spain, 3:50 4th quarter The largest margin of victory in Olympic gold medal game history is 44 points. That came in 1948 when the U.S. beat France, 65-29. The lead is currently at 39 points. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.18pm EDT 16:18 USA 88-47 Serbia, 5:52 4th quarter Serbia calls timeout after an alley-oop finish by DeMar DeRozan. I don’t know what exactly you say in a timeout at this point. Probably something like: “We had a good tournament. We’re going to win silver. Let’s end this with some pride.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.16pm EDT 16:16 USA 84-47 Serbia, 6:45 4th quarter The U.S. is pre-celebrating on the bench. Kevin Durant is out of the game with 30 points. Carmelo Anthony is out, too, and awaiting his third gold medal. Draymond Green is in the game. Harrison Barnes still watches and waits. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.12pm EDT 16:12 Adam Reisinger (@AdamReisinger) Fewest pts by US player in Olympics since 1992: Okafor (2004) - 0 Stockton (1992) - 11 Kidd (2008) - 13 Green (2016) - 13 Barnes (2016) - 15 August 21, 2016 The U.S. has nearly a 40-point lead with just over 8 minutes left and Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green still haven’t entered the game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.11pm EDT 16:11 USA 82-43 Serbia, 9:05 4th quarter Kevin Durant and Jimmy Butler just dove on the floor for a loose ball. They don’t have to. In fact, considering this game is over and they’re worth tens of millions, they probably shouldn’t. But they still did. No one can say NBA players don’t care about these games or don’t try hard. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.07pm EDT 16:07 End of the 3rd quarter: USA 79-43 Serbia Are we still calling it a run? Sure. The U.S. is now on a 67-29 “run.” Or, you know, they’re just the far superior team. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.05pm EDT 16:05 USA 77-41 Serbia, 1:14 4th quarter Two more for Cousins on a monster dunk. He has 13 points and 14 boards. Meanwhile, Jokic has just 4 points and 3 boards on the heels of his big game earlier in the tournament versus the U.S. It’s not so much that the U.S. neutralized him, but that Serbia’s gameplan didn’t much include him. Strange. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.01pm EDT 16:01 USA 75-40 Serbia, 1:46 3rd quarter Nikola Kalinić has now fouled out. It might be the best performance of the game for Serbia because he at least doesn’t have to suffer anymore. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.59pm EDT 15:59 USA 73-39 Serbia, 2:23 3rd quarter Serbia looks completely defeated. The only thing worse than their body language is their 3-for-19 shooting from three. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.57pm EDT 15:57 USA 66-37 Serbia, 4:12 3rd quarter Durant now has 28 points and Klay Thompson has 12. So a team featuring some of the best players in the NBA is getting 60% of its points from two Warriors in the gold medal game. And Steph Curry isn’t even in Brazil. So, yes, Golden State should be pretty good again this year. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.54pm EDT 15:54 USA 64-35 Serbia, 4:47 3rd quarter At the risk of losing liveblog readers, this game is over. (Please! Don’t go!) The U.S. isn’t letting off the gas. If anything, they’re playing better now than they did in the 2nd quarter. The defense is stifling and they’re making the extra pass on offense to get wide wide wide WIDE open shots. The positive new for Serbia is that they’re less than 15 minutes away from a silver medal. Updated at 3.54pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.51pm EDT 15:51 USA 57-33 Serbia, 6:00 3rd quarter Serbia seems to have given up on the three-pointer. You can’t blame them, they’re just 3-for-18 from deep in the game. But to have any hope of coming back, they’re going to need to shoot (and hit) from three. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.49pm EDT 15:49 USA 55-33 Serbia, 7:35 3rd quarter Teodosic knocks down a jumper with a man in his face. He has struggled from the field today, shooting 0-for-4 from three, but leads his team in scoring with 9 points. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.47pm EDT 15:47 USA 55-31 Serbia, 9:05 3rd quarter Carmelo Anthony, who didn’t play much in the first half, opened the scoring in the half for the U.S. with a three. At least Serbia can say it didn’t let Durant score? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.46pm EDT 15:46 Second half underway! Here we go. Serbia needs to chip away in the first five minutes or this will end with the intensity of an international friendly. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.43pm EDT 15:43 Ryan Lochte has to love that the Mongolian wrestling coaches have come along on the final day of the Olympics to get people talking about something else. Tim Cato (@tim_cato) people: "wow harrison barnes is the worst team usa player ever" me: pic.twitter.com/bA2jEDJjA7 August 21, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.41pm EDT 15:41 Serbia needs some positive thoughts to keep them motivated for the second half. I suspect they’re not following this liveblog in the locker room, but if so, here’s something they can rally around: At the end of the 1st half, Serbia is beating Kevin Durant, 29-24. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.38pm EDT 15:38 An e-mail from reader Boris Handžiski, quoting the liveblog: “Since then, Serbia is beating the U.S. by a score of 99-82.” Is Serbia still beating the US? Love how everything Americans do is given a negative spin. It wasn’t a negative spin. It was an accurate stat from early in the game when Serbia was winning. There’s no possible negative spin to put on anything the U.S. is doing now. It’s complete domination. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.35pm EDT 15:35 Serbia did not play well in the first half and the U.S. played its best basketball of the Rio Games. That’s the exact recipe for an underdog team losing in a blowout. Sometimes stats are misleading, but this is not one of those times. The U.S. is shooting 44% from the field to Serbia’s 31% and dominating the boards, 31-16. Serbia has a huge advantage in fouls, turnovers and missed three-pointers, though. That’s ... something. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.32pm EDT 15:32 End of the 1st half: USA 52-29 Serbia That second quarter performance by the U.S. was what many thought the team was capable of at the start of the tournament. After struggling at the start of the game, the U.S. closed the half on a 40-15 run. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.29pm EDT 15:29 USA 49-29 Serbia, 0:45 2nd quarter More free throw action for DeMarcus Cousins. He then exits with 11 points and 12 rebounds. His big game is only being overshadowed by Durant, who now has 21 points on 8-of-13 shooting. Serbia is actually looking more confused on how to guard him as the game goes on. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.27pm EDT 15:27 Kevin McCaffrey (@KevinMcCaff) Love watching really good players whose NBA teams suck (Cousins, Carmelo) get to play in high pressure games that matter August 21, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.26pm EDT 15:26 USA 45-25 Serbia, 2:46 2nd quarter The ugliness of Team USA’s offense from early in the game is over. They’re now getting wide open looks from inside, outside and mid-range. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.24pm EDT 15:24 USA 40-22 Serbia, 4:50 2nd quarter Another three by Durant is followed by another tough bucket underneath by Cousins. That inside-outside combo is killing Serbia right now. Also killing Serbia? The fact that they’re shooting just 32% from the floor. Updated at 3.26pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.23pm EDT 15:23 USA 35-22 Serbia, 5:45 2nd quarter Kyrie Irving hits two free throws. Kalinic now has four fouls and Raduljica has three. Serbia needs to make this game ugly and scrappy ... but they also need to have players left to play in the second half. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.21pm EDT 15:21 USA 33-22 Serbia, 5:59 2nd quarter Teodosic hits a runner to get Serbia a little closer. And that came after Kevin Durant actually missed a shot. That’s the most positive series of plays Serbia has seen since the first quarter. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.16pm EDT 15:16 USA 33-20 Serbia, 6:57 2nd quarter And here comes Kevin Durant. Another three-pointer ... and now another ... gives him 12 points on seven field goal attempts. He only scored 12 points on four shots in the first match-up. Annnnnnd there’s two more points by Durant on a turnover and dunk. He’s got 14. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.14pm EDT 15:14 USA 25-15 Serbia, 8:36 2nd quarter DeMarcus Cousins now has 7 points and 7 rebounds with 5 of his points from the line. Serbia is struggling to handle him inside and they’re racking up fouls try to. Three Serbian starters now have at least two fouls. The U.S. run is at 13-1. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.11pm EDT 15:11 USA 23-15 Serbia, 9:16 2nd quarter The U.S. opens the 2nd quarter fast and now is on an 11-1 run. Serbia Jokic, who had the huge game in the group stage, has 0 points so far today. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.09pm EDT 15:09 End of the 1st quarter: USA 19-15 Serbia The U.S. shot just 35% from the field, but still has the lead. Serbia only hit at 31-percent. Yeah, it hasn’t been an extremely beautiful display of offensive basketball so far. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.07pm EDT 15:07 USA 19-15 Serbia, 0:25 1st quarter So much for the complaint about Durant putting them up from too deep ... he just knocked one down from way beyond the top of the circle in transition. Updated at 3.07pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.06pm EDT 15:06 USA 16-14 Serbia, 1:05 1st quarter The U.S. takes its first lead on a lay-in by DeMarcus Cousins on a great feed from DeMar DeRozan. But then Cousins missed the free throw. The U.S. is now 4-for-8 from the line or as it’s sometimes called: “they’re a DeAndre.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.03pm EDT 15:03 Serbia 14-12 USA, 1:40 1st quarter Kevin Durant needs to shoot more than he did the first time these two teams met, but his last two attempts have been long heaves from way behind the three-point line with time left on the shot clock. He’s now 1-for-4 from the field and 0-for-2 from three. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.00pm EDT 15:00 Serbia 13-11 USA, 3:30 1st quarter Long way to go, obviously, but remember that Serbia lost just 94-91 in the group stage ... and that was after trailing 9-0 at the start and being down as much as 22. Since then, Serbia is beating the U.S. by a score of 99-82. It’s no wonder Mike Krzyzewski looks so stressed on the bench. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.57pm EDT 14:57 Nate Duncan (@NateDuncanNBA) First USA pass with 7 on the shot clock. August 21, 2016 In most games in the tournament, defense has been the USA’s problem. Not so far today. The offense has no movement. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.56pm EDT 14:56 Serbia 9-9 USA, 4:49 1st quarter The U.S. is creating some offense with defense. DeAndre Jordan just ended a Serbian layup attempt with a massive block that created a fast break. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.54pm EDT 14:54 Serbia 7-7 USA, 5:55 1st quarter Durant finishes a dunk after a steal. He is being active on the offensive end so far. In the first game against Serbia, he only put up four shots from the field. The U.S. needs its best player to be more involved in the biggest game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.52pm EDT 14:52 Serbia 7-4 USA, 6:35 1st quarter It looks like the good Serbian team showed up so far in this one. However, the U.S. would really help itself by playing more deliberately on the offensive end. So far it’s had some ugly turnovers and unnecessary shots. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.49pm EDT 14:49 Serbia 3-2 USA, 8:31 1st quarter DeAndre Jordan scores inside and is fouled. You’ll never guess what happened next. Actually, you will: he missed the free throw. Interesting that Jokic isn’t starting for Serbia after he had a huge game against the U.S. in the group stage. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.48pm EDT 14:48 Serbia 3-0 USA, 9:13 1st quarter After another U.S. turnover, this time by Kevin Durant, Macvan hits a wide open three to open the scoring. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.47pm EDT 14:47 Tip-off! U.S. controls the tip, but Kyrie Irving turns the ball over on his first pass. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.45pm EDT 14:45 Here are the starting lineups for both teams: USA: Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving Serbia: Milan Macvan, Nikola Kalinic, Miroslav Raduljica, Stefan Markovic, Milos Teodosic Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.39pm EDT 14:39 Serbia will need to be at their best today to have a chance to win. Obviously. But consistency has been a major problem so far in the Olympics. The team only went 2-3 in the group stage, including a 15-point loss to Australia -- the same team they blew out in Friday’s semifinal game. This is a team that lost to France, almost lost to Croatia ... and almost beat Kevin Durant and the star-studded U.S. team. For the sake of good entertainment, if nothing else, let’s hope the good Serbian team shows up today. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.33pm EDT 14:33 It will be interesting to see how Mike Krzyzewski, Tom Thibodeau and the U.S. coaching staff handles Serbian big man Nikola Jokic. He had 25 points on 11-of-15 shooting in the narrow 94-91 win in the group stage. DeAndre Jordan has made his career on defense, and he’ll need to show up big for the U.S. today. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.28pm EDT 14:28 No matter the outcome of the gold medal game, the men’s and women’s tournament will have the same three nations medaling thanks to Spain* knocking off Australia in this morning bronze medal game. The U.S., Spain and Serbia medaled on the women’s side and the same three nations will do so for the men. I think we can safely call them the best basketball countries in the world. *Spain and the officials, depending on your opinion of the foul call on Spain’s final possession. Updated at 2.42pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.25pm EDT 14:25 Welcome to the liveblog for the Men’s Basketball gold medal game. The U.S. will try to win its third consecutive men’s gold while Serbia has an opportunity to best its lone men’s basketball medal: a silver from the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Serboa has an opportunity, however small. The U.S. team has looked beatable at times in Rio, but no team has completed the job. Serbia almost did it in the group stage, missing a three-pointer on their last possession to fall 94-91. They’re about to get one more shot.

Here is the company's charismatic CEO, John Leger, talking about their data plan in an uncomfortably small jacket to tell you all about it: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In the video, Leger promises to abolish data caps on his network, meaning you only have to pay one price to stream as much music, visit your favourite 24-hour entertainment news websites (insert wink emoji here) or watch as much YouTube as you want. In standard definition. Yep, it turns out that "unlimited" promise doesn't cover plans across the whole network after all. The Daily Dot reports that you have to subscribe to a more costly data package if you want to watch video in HD, which sounds like a limit to us. The website also claims that T-Mobile will throttle the internet speeds of people who use more than 26 gigabytes per month "but only at specific times and places". And, for any of you thinking that doesn't sound exactly fair, you may just be onto something. Related Article Best unlimited data plans to remove smartphone stress As it turns out, the US implemented net neutrality laws last year stating that companies could not limit users access based on their usage, or make them pay extra to remove these limits, so it looks like T-Mobile is in the wrong here. It's not the first time T-Mobile have got in trouble over 'unlimited' internet, either as a few years ago the Advertising Standards Agency told the network they were making false claims. The company was also questioned earlier this year about implementing bandwidth limits, and John Leger had a pretty foul-mouthed reply: .@EFF pic.twitter.com/pv6V4oOJwS — John Legere (@JohnLegere) January 7, 2016 PREVIOUS ARTICLE Anarchists hack electronic road sign with a message to police NEXT ARTICLE Premier League footballer offers a "sincere and unreserved apology" after homophobic tweet Most Popular Don't Miss 01 9 of the best mobile apps to download this week GIF 02 How to see EVERY Google search you've ever made 03 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 preview: the best phone... 04 iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6S: Which is better? 05 iPhone Game of the Week – Steamworld Heist Latest News 01 Is Geordie Shore's Marnie Simpson engaged AGAIN? 02 Has EastEnders finally "got" Billy Mitchell?

Menu Technology Health Business Stocks U.S. Staff About/Contact Privacy Policy Home Technology Google Debuts Video-Calling App: Google Duo Google Debuts Video-Calling App: Google Duo Technology August 21, 2016 No Comments admin duo, Google Duo, video calling Google has revealed its video calling app called Google Duo. The Google Duo app is a simple 1-to-1 video calling app available on both the Android and iOS platforms. Duo removes the complexity of video calling, making you be together in the moment no matter where you are. Duo has been built with an emphasis on security and privacy. All Duo calls are end-to-end encrypted. Google has now successfully joined dozens of other services who offer free video calling, from giants like Microsoft Skype to smaller firms such as Viber. Duo is a simple app from start to finish. All you require is your phone number and you are good to go. You will be able to make calls to people in your phone’s contacts list across device types and platforms. You do not require any separate account. You can just sign up and begin to make calls in few easy taps. From there, a video call can instantly be started with a single tap. The roll out of the Google Duo app for Android and iOS has already started. It will be live worldwide within the next couple of days. The unique feature of Knock Knock in Google Duo has been designed to be fun and inviting. The feature allows people to be able to see live video of the caller even before answering the call. It gives a short preview of the incoming call by showing a short, live video of the caller.  This gives you a sense of what the person is up to and their reason for calling. Knock Knock makes video calling more welcoming and spontaneous. It helps users to connect with the person even before picking up the call. You do not require any Google account to enjoy this free service, that enables video calling from phone number to phone number irrespective of the hardware platform. This will make it easier for those who will like to call from an Android to an iPhone or an Android to Android. Duo has been built to be reliable and fast. This will make it possible for video calls to connect quickly and work well even if the network is slow. Call quality adjusts to varying network conditions to keep you connected even in limited bandwidth. Duo will stylishly reduce the resolution to keep the call going smoothly. For video calls on the go, Duo can switch automatically between cellular data and Wi-Fi, even without dropping your call. The video will shift into a lower definition appearance if reception degrades, but audio will still stay crisp. “Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person. We have designed the interface to be simple, easy and welcoming. In places like India, it has been designed to adapt to the network connectivity conditions. We hope to make the experience of video calling more personal, inviting easy and smooth”, said Amit Fulay, Group Product Manager, Google. Although Google already has a calling feature in its Hangouts chat app, but Duo will be more appealing to a larger group of people. Hangouts require a Google account and is built largely for productivity and for connecting other Google services like calendars and contacts.

So let’s check ’em all in details. Next-Gen Fuchsia OS Google is reported to be in on-going development of Fuchsia OS. As far as we are concerned, there is a truly brief description about this new OS. Fuchsia OS is not any the same base kernel as Android or Chrome OS. This new Fuchsia is based on Magenta kernel. Apart from those features, Fuchsia also will bring the Flutter UI framework with a user-friendly Material Design showing those of a modern fully-operated OS functionalities for like multiple users, next level of security, and graphics rendering, and so on. Excited? B…Bye to Chrome Apps for Windows, Mac, Linux Chrome apps, like Hangouts and Google Keep, were launched three years ago due to the web lacking offline capabilities, notifications, and connecting to hardware. packaged and hosted Chrome apps will continue functioning on Chromebooks for the foreseeable future. New features to the Chrome apps platform will apply only to Chrome OS devices. Maybe this is because only 1% of those on Windows, Mac, and Linux actually use Chrome packaged apps. Google Duo Arrives Tech giant Google officially launched Google Duo a simple 1-to-1 video calling app available for Android and iOS. Google Duo is allows you to connect anyone in from phone-book. Duo’s Knock Knock feature will give you a live video preview of the caller before you pick up. All the calls on Duo are end-to-end encrypted. App can switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call. Go and grab the all new app from the Google Playstore or from App Store. Hangout On Air is Discontinued The upcoming Google Allo and Duo can be the best replacement for Hangout on Air. Since things has been changing. It is said that the Hangouts on Air feature is being redirected to YouTube Live, but other features of Showcase, Applause, and Q&A are staying. Google Allo Google is yet to announce the brother of the Google Duo. Google Allo will have number of new exciting features. Unlike Google’s previous messaging services, Allo will have the ability to delete messages from your chat’s history. Based on screenshots obtained by Android Police, Allo will give users the option to select a message and permanently delete it from the chat’s history. Android Pay will soon show users where the NFC chip is on various smartphones. So, yes! That’s all for this Google Weekly. Any suggestions are welcome by a comment and contact us form.

Log in here opinion 194 Shares 31 comments Google's messaging app paradox Authored by: Chris Marshall 2016-08-21T16:00:00Z 3 months ago Google has just released Duo, and soon it will be time for it to release its fourth messaging app, Allo. Eric Schmidt, Executive Chair of Alphabet, decided this wasn't complicated enough. He wants one messaging app to triumph and cannibalize the others. Is this a good plan or the creation of a delicious paradox? Why I won't be using Allo, Google's coolest new app Google Duo promises to bring iOS and Android users closer Google has a rather frustrating/rewarding habit of acting like a puppy with insatiable curiosity. On the one hand, it means we get the best machine learning algorithms in the world put to use on our smartphones; on the other hand, it means we have four messaging apps dividing the user base and no reason to believe the number won't grow in the future. Platforms, platforms and a few more platforms. / © AndroidPIT Eric Schmidt took to the stage for an interview at Startup Fest Europe, and he said that Google Allo is "better than anything else on the market" and asked that "before we sort of criticize it, why don't you use it?" Well, because no one has any idea when it's coming out. And if Google Allo really is the best messaging app ever, why wouldn't Google do away with Hangouts and Messenger? Google seemed to have developed such a close bond with failure that it refuses to believe wholeheartedly in any of its new products, and the threat of abandonment lurks, constantly, over every new app. Why would I feel inclined to adopt Allo and buy into the idea that is the best thing on the market, when Google itself doesn't seem willing to do the same? The position Eric Schmidt adopted in the interview, when asked by an audience member how Google keeps focused with such a wide array of messaging apps, was that "people have made this into a big deal: it's not." When large swathes of your user base are decrying a certain element of your ecosystem or product, it seems proud and stubborn to discount those concerns as pithy blather. Google now talks about Hangouts as a business app while threatening to melt it down into Allo fuel. / © AndroidPIT But this is not even my primary problem with what Schmidt had to say. He continued: "Assuming Allo does well, the others can be integrated into that effort over time...it's easy to integrate the others into the winning product." The assumption that there will be a winning product is a big one. No other successful messaging app that I can think of has achieved its success in this way. Here's the paradox as I see it: Schmidt wants a winner to unify the system, but there can't be a winner until there is a unified system. Schmidt also restated that Google's approach is one of experimentation. This is great, and means that things like augmented reality are making real progress, but how effective or beneficial is this approach when you're using it on consumer products intended for casual use by millions? Why build something as an experiment that is going to deepen user frustrations when it is abandoned or sidelined in favor of the next experiment a few years later? Google would argue that it's always pushing forward and that this experimentation requires abandoning old products, but how long can users expect this to continue without anything being placed in their hands that Google deems worthy of pursuing for more than a couple of years? Why are Allo and Duo even separate apps? Google says it because they've discovered that people like to use different apps for different things, but is this true? What if people are using different apps in this way is not because they want to but simply because different people they know happen to be on these different services? I find the arguments for Duo and Allo flimsy, paradoxical and a little insulting. Do you agree, or do you think Google's style of experimentation is a beneficial thing for Android users?

That is where I feel they should have gone and I can not for the life of me see how not combining them would be a problem. Perhaps, since other apps out there do offer some of these combined features - the 1 thing I from my own experience can say is that most do not handle all the features they offer well. Viber is great for messaging, pretty good in sharing location and info, fair in calls, not good in video calling. Line is better at video calling and pretty good at messaging (but slow), and pretty good in sharing info. Whatsapp is good at messaging, and pretty good at calling but no video call. FB messenger is not very good on video calls, only fair on audio calls but messaging very good. I could go on. But none of these has the Virtual Assistance Feature they are pushing in ALLO. I must admit - if it works nearly as good as they claim - for those of us who do admin work - it could be worth it - hopefully they will include a schedule sms feature. ALLO also would just use regular SMS which almost everyone has the ability and that helps as well. Since all these other apps - tend to have their own eco system (granted a few of them can handle SMS - which I for the most part do not use). However, like many of you - I am waiting impatiently and announcing this so early without the app even in beta for testing for users I don't think was a wise choice. 0 Reply 2 Ron Hagley 2 months ago Link to comment Oh dear what a stupid idea - who even needs another messaging app? I already have email which does fine for 99% of my messaging needs. The odd 1% is perfectly covered by Whatsapp. This is just another pathetic idea by Google to gather even more info on us! As if the idiotic Google + wasn't enough. I have no time for this ridiculous social nonsence Google just get on with what you do best - be a search engine! 1 Mike Lippert Reply 12 GrimJimCrowley 2 months ago Link to comment My wife and my other friends with iPhone use iMessage to send message, sms, and Face Time. It's one app. So why does Google think that Android users want to rifle through 9238842023 apps to find THE BEST messaging, and THE BEST video messaging app? It's problems like this that are making Samsung look at their own eco system and ditching Android altogether. 0 Reply 2 Mutter Fly 2 months ago Link to comment Share products online with awesome people nearby and earn money easily through mutterfly.in , online rental portable now available in google play store 0 Reply 5 Eric 3 months ago Link to comment Allo looks like it will be an app we will all use having Google assistant and cards which will always be running and helping within the conversating and which will get even smarter the more it gets to know the user it will evolve the more you use Allo it is a way to get Google now and Google search integrated into our messages is a brilliant smart business move by Google we will be able to chat with Google in any msg even ask Google direct questions involve Google in our lives even more than we do now Google have so much data on us and this is a way to get even more personal and have a service that should be direct and give users a more personal touch.....also by separating these services into duo and allo apps this is more to give us a seamless experience a more faster experience and for the budget devices with hangouts we all need a Google account before using it loads of users hated this now it is phone number only because of the cross platform use the app is small in size and duo app even after using stays under 10mb in size duo will only ever be a video and voice call app simple smooth and really faster than hangouts for video calling we have a better experience 0 Reply 2 Mutter Fly 3 months ago Link to comment Nice Post...

Were they under pressure to do so? Waiting for months for an app to finally make an appearance after its announcement is rather annoying and people tend to lose interest. 1 magus corvin Reply 4 Brian Carr 3 months ago Link to comment simplicity is the key in apps 😁 1 Rideau Reply 33 skyrail 3 months ago Link to comment >do you think Google's style of experimentation is a beneficial thing for Android users? I'll make an answer as a usual early-adopter : NO. Of course, it place higher the competition with other companies products. It counts on users experience feedback to develop and integrate new usages. But, for a professional usage, people need stability, reliability, make habits. So we are kind of disturbed by google products getting unpredictable on a long term usage. 0 Reply 2 Justin Stewart {Justin's Voices} 3 months ago Link to comment Just release the damn app!

And even if Allo would become a hit, I'd stick to Threema due to privacy concerns in regard to Google apps. 1 magus corvin Reply 2 Shaun Smith 3 months ago Link to comment Eric Schmidt is an Executive Chair at Alphabet, not CEO. His point is, and I think it's a good one, that it's just a messaging app. Chill. They have thousands of employees, comprising hundreds of teams to make any all of these apps work well for the consumer who chooses them. Hangouts will stay because it is the backbone of Google's internal video call network. Messenger is there because, well, it's the primary messaging app for Android. Allo isn't even out yet. So there. Pretty much makes the article/opinion worthless. 2 NikoRideau Reply 2 Brodie Kurczynski 3 months ago Link to comment Larry Page is the CEO of Alphabet... 2 NikoShaun Smith Reply 14 Chris Marshall 3 months ago Link to comment Duly noted. An unfortunate oversight. 0 Reply 3 David “LagunaStarMan” Mitchell 3 months ago Link to comment I like the concept of experimentation. One can think of Google as an experiment in experimentation :-) I personally find Duo useful as a separate app. Simply put, when I want to do a video call I hit the Duo icon instead of the telephone icon. There is a certain simplicity in wanting to do something and being able to select it with a single tap of a finger. I find apps that have too many options, and too many decision trees, before getting to what you want as ineffective. All of this will probably be made obsolete in time by AI and voice recognition. 3 RideauNikoChristian Todhunter Reply 2 Christian Todhunter 3 months ago Link to comment I'm a Google fan. I think what they are doing with messaging apps is clever. Instead of doing a beta with one app, they are launching full fledged messaging apps. They are seeing what people use most out of each app and taking notes, and I think that part of their strategy is to continue to support the apps with high usage, while integrating what's most commonly used out of those apps (both high and low usage) into their newest solution, enter Allo. When reading Eric's quotes in this article, I hear him saying that Google is not in a hurry to get it right, but they are working on it. They are building a forest, right now it just looks like a bunch of trees, but you need trees before you can have a forest. I don't think it's a paradox, I think it's social Darwinism. Maybe Allo is just another tree, but I'm hoping it becomes the forest. 2 RideauNiko Reply 33 skyrail 3 months ago Link to comment I am not gonna use the app most of people use as beta test to see how well it works, just because it's popular. See what happen to clean master. I loved this app under Android 4.4.2. Now it has evolved as real mess ! All bullshit ! 0 Reply Show all comments Write a comment!

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Who Will Win the Google vs. Oracle Legal Battle? August 21, 2016 10:44am Nasdaq:GOOGL ShareTweet From Zacks: The Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) vs. Oracle case seems to be winding on forever and current developments don’t even seem too newsy any more. But that doesn’t mean it’s all over, not by a long shot. The last we heard about it, Google won the case against Oracle on the principle of fair use, a decision Oracle vowed to appeal. That’s because fair use is a kind of defense where the offender admits to the offense (in this case copyright infringement) but explains why the infringement was justified. Normally, “fair use” can be resorted to when the offender is able to show that a) the infringement benefited many, so was for common good; b) if the copyrighted material was a small part of the end product created, i.e., there was true originality/innovation in the product created that is distinguishable from the copyrighted material; c) if the infringement can cause material harm to the original work, for example by reducing its market value or impacting its ability to generate revenue. There is no dispute about Android’s usefulness: it has enabled many phone makers with limited means to bring smartphones to market thereby increasing competition and lowering the price of smartphones. This in turn has made smartphones accessible to many more. Further, it has created an ecosystem of developers that can depend on it for their livelihood. Google’s own revenue generation is indirect: it only makes money when customers use its apps that are pre-loaded on the devices. Second, there is also no dispute about the end product. In fact, the lines of Java code used in Android are important but a tiny fraction of Android. Java use in Android is essentially restricted to the application programming interface (API), a virtual machine-powered application platform on top of the OS that helps to add functionality to devices because it allows third-party apps to run on them. In this case, Google used Java SE (the desktop version) and not Java ME (the mobile version). Third, whether there is material harm to Oracle is debatable because while Android is a tremendous force today, that’s not the way it started out. Android grew over time and Oracle didn’t buy Sun (which created Java) until Android was already successful. Oracle could theoretically have devoted resources and time to develop on Java, but instead it thought it could get a bite out of Android. As far as Sun is concerned, its former CEO Jonathan Schwartz has testified in court that “We had the foundational technologies to make it work, but we weren’t able to get it to market in time…It’s very difficult. We had R&D choices we had to make. We couldn’t fund every project.” Further, on being asked whether Sun’s failure to launch a Java-based smartphone had anything to do with Android, he said “No.”   ALPHABET INC-A Price ALPHABET INC-A Price | ALPHABET INC-A Quote   But that’s not the end of the story. The Role of APIs APIs are like gateways or better, sockets in hardware that third parties plug their stuff into. They constitute software code that enable different programs to communicate with each other. So it’s important that these APIs remain neutral so companies can’t fleece the world at large every time they are used. Media reports indicate that courts have thus far ruled in favor of maintaining this neutrality of APIs. And that’s exactly why the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has repeatedly filed amicus curiae (friend/impartial advisor to the court) briefs so the courts hold that APIs aren’t copyrightable and to prevent Oracle from monetizing the Java API through its acquisition of Sun. And in fact, the case revealed that it was Sun’s practice to allow companies to freely use Java APIs. Sun’s strategy in those days was to use this approach to extend Java’s reach as far as possible so more developers would build on it. The idea was that once the ecosystem gathered momentum, it would help Sun sell other products. So was Google under the impression that it could get away without a license? From the publicly available information it is difficult to determine whether Google thought it needed a license. It’s clear that Sun wanted a commercial relationship with Google that didn’t work out for some reason. According to Schwartz it was “a combination of money and technical dependence.…Google didn’t want to rely, as best as I understand, on anyone else.” Then again, former Android head Andy Rubin testified in court that Sun didn’t want Google to give away Android for free (this could have been because it’s hard to fix lucrative licensing terms for something free). Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt said he had been willing to fork out $30-40 million for a five-year license but what exactly that license was for is unclear. It might have been for the code Google used or something more than that (since the Java logo was supposed to appear in various places in that arrangement and the talks may have fallen apart because of Google’s desire to give away the OS for free). The May 2016 hearing in which the jury ruled in favor of Google’s fair use was therefore good news for the future of software development (and every Android user because we are not using a criminally infringing device). So Why Are We Bringing This Up Again Today? Oracle lawyers are now saying that Google withheld key information. One of the defenses Google took in the retrial depended was that it had used the desktop version of Java while Android was used in mobile devices. Oracle says that the recent launch of Google Play on Chrome therefore renders this defense groundless. They therefore think another retrial is justified so the jury can have access to this information. Google’s response was that during discovery Oracle had asked for and received information about App Runtime for Chrome (ARC), so Oracle could have pursued the matter then. And the update ARC++ was still in the works at the time, so wasn’t mentioned, especially since “it was beyond the scope of the trial”. The judge told Google “If I had been in your position, I would have disclosed.” But he also questioned Oracle’s asking for a retrial because it didn’t use the information available to influence this jury and was asking for another hearing.  He will rule on the new angle in writing. ORACLE CORP Price ORACLE CORP Price | ORACLE CORP Quote   In Conclusion This case isn’t likely to get resolved any time soon and both companies still have a fair chance to win. Google could simply take a license or Oracle could simply back off. But neither of those two things looks like it’s going to happen. Here are a few companies you could focus on instead as they have favorable Zacks ranks and are therefore worth a look: NVIDIA Corp (NVDA – Analyst Report) , Paylocity Holdings (PCTY – Snapshot Report) and Autobytel Inc (ABTL – Snapshot Report).

And can you use Waze safely to report road conditions while driving? Google Maps is a more straightforward map application and includes information about businesses and other points of interest in a given area. Maps can be saved ahead of time for offline use, and satellite views are usually available for most places. In addition to driving directions, the app can supply navigation information for mass transit systems, as well as for those travelling by bicycle or by foot. Waze, primarily used for driving, takes a more playful approach to the travel experience. The app combines a social network with game-like features, allowing its users to communicate with other road warriors, earn points for reporting highway conditions and search for the cheapest gas prices nearby. Waze users can occasionally set the app to temporarily use celebrity voices for the audio navigation; actor Morgan Freeman is among those who have recorded driving directions in the past. Having a passenger in the car operate the Waze app helps keep the car’s driver focused on the road. But for those driving solo, Waze can be configured to respond to voice commands. In the Waze app, tap the Search/Menu icon in the bottom-left corner, and then tap the gear-shaped Settings icon in the top-left corner of the next screen. Under Advanced Settings, tap Voice Commands and flip the switch next to Enable. Choose how you wish to activate the app when you want to speak a command — by tapping the screen with three fingers or waving your hand in front of the device. When you are driving, just activate Waze and say “Report accident,” “Report heavy traffic” or utter verbalized versions of any of the app’s other icons for noting highway incidents. Q: Are there any bulk email programs that are free or low-cost? I need a program to send messages to email lists containing 50 to 500 addresses. Several programs for sending email to large subscriber lists are available online, and many are free to use — with limits. Some services may restrict the number of addresses on your mailing list, or cap the amount of messages you may send each week or month. Free versions may also restrict you to generic message templates, but you can add custom designs and other features on a paid plan. With many bulk mail services, you start by signing up for an account and then importing the addresses on your mailing list from an Excel spreadsheet, a comma-separated values file or a text document. When shopping around, be sure to check the features list and read the user reviews to make sure the software fits your needs. MailChimp, an email marketing service established in 2001, offers several plans, including a Forever Free plan that allows you to send up to 12,000 messages a month to a maximum of 2,000 subscribers. The site has help guides and thorough documentation on setting up your first email campaign. (It also has a page of information on complying with spam laws, which can be useful to read no matter which service you end up using.) Other services with free plans include SendInBlue, an easy-to-use bulk mail program that allows you to send up to 9,000 messages a month to an unlimited number of contacts. Zoho Campaigns allows up to 2,000 subscribers and 12,000 messages a month. If you want a program you can install on your computer, SendBlaster for Windows is one of the many options out there. A free version is available on the company’s site, or you can buy a full-featured edition for $129 (Rs 8,650). Windows and OS X users may also want to check out the $50 (Rs 3,353) MaxBulk Mailer.

Is this the way to compete with Verizon and AT&T? Adam Levy (adamlevy) Aug 21, 2016 at 9:41AM Image source: Google Fiber. In the nearly four years since Google brought its gigabit internet service, Google Fiber, to Kansas City, it's expanded to just five other metro areas. The internet and television service is now part of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) "other bets" segment, which overall had $185 million in revenue in Q2 and an operating loss of $859 million. Despite hundreds of millions invested in the acquisition and buildout of its fiber network, it's still slow going for Fiber. The task of surveying neighborhoods to determine their viability and then physically digging up roads and providing fiber to the home is very time- and capital-intensive. That's why Fiber is rethinking its strategy, and it recently made an acquisition to potentially decrease the time and capital expenditures required to expand its service. The company in June bought WebPass, which is a small, high-speed internet service provider. What makes WebPass interesting is its wireless technology, which allows it to beam internet into apartment buildings, for example, using an antenna connected to a fiber line. That technology reduces the amount of fiber it needs to lay before serving a community, and it's something Google Fiber itself has been working on since the beginning of the year. This stuff gets expensive Before diving into how WebPass can help Google Fiber grow, let's take a look at its current expenses and the issues it could have scaling. Alphabet doesn't break out Fiber's financials on its own, instead lumping them in with the rest of the other bets segment. Other bets' capital expenditures totaled $280 million last quarter, up from $232 million the year before. Last year, Alphabet spent $869 million on other bets' capital expenditures. During Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat said the other bets' capex "primarily reflect[s] ongoing investment in our Fiber business." It's no surprise Fiber is expensive. Both Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) invested a significant amount to rapidly expand their broadband networks before pulling back over the last couple of years. Verizon's wireline capital expenditures increased from $8.27 billion in 2005 to $10.96 billion in 2007 as it aggressively built out its FiOS business. Last year, AT&T said it had spent more than $140 billion over the previous six years building out a fiber network. It had launched in 20 metro areas at that point. Cutting costs Verizon has cut back on building out its FiOS network, and AT&T is now focusing only on gigabit internet. The latter is relying on DirecTV to continue growing its pay-TV business, while Verizon is more focused on digital video. But both may soon find themselves competing with Google Fiber in an area called fixed wireless broadband. Verizon plans to use its upcoming 5G network to provide high-speed internet service in customers' homes. Google Fiber might use WebPass' antenna technology to do something very similar. The biggest advantage of using a 5G cell tower or an antenna connected to a fiber line is that the cost of connecting a neighborhood is dramatically reduced. The service provider simply needs to build a signal site on a street corner (it could be connected to an existing structure, like a street light), then customers place a receiver in their window. That solution would reduce the amount of fiber cable Google needs to lay and the number of streets it needs to dig up. As Alphabet's Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said at its annual shareholders meeting, "these point-to-point solutions are cheaper than digging up your garden." The question is, will Fiber be able to overcome the massive budget and expenditures of AT&T and the deployment of both its and Verizon's 5G networks? Fiber could eventually compete, and it certainly has the capability to undercut both on pricing considering its sister company, but Alphabet wants to show that its moonshots can eventually become profitable businesses, so being able to make money after investing billions would be nice, too.

What are the features offered by each of them, and which app should you use?  ( Google ) Advertisement Google is currently offering Hangouts, Allo and Duo as apps that users can utilize for communication purposes. While there are some who would argue that it would have been better if Google had combined all the apps into one massive communications platform, Google apparently thinks that it would be better to release multiple apps that users can choose from depending on what they need to do. What are Hangouts, Allo and Duo all about, and which app should you use? Google Hangouts Many users by now are familiar with Google Hangouts, with the messaging platform already in existence for three years. During that time, the communications app has accumulated many features such as video calling and SMS support. The main selling point of Hangouts is the possibility of cross-platform communication between desktop computers and mobile, with users able to send and receive messages across the two platforms. Google Allo Allo, which was announced by Google at the I/O 2016 developer conference, is a mobile-only messaging app that relies on the user's phone number. Tagged as competition against popular mobile messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, Allo has the typical features of such an app but also uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to make messaging more convenient for users. One of the major features of Allo is Smart Reply, which provides users with suggestions on responses that they can send within conversations. The app will remember the choices that users make or the message that they instead type out, and will apply what it learns in future conversations. Allo, unlike Hangouts, also allows users to delete messages from their chat history. Google Duo Duo famously surpassed massively popular augmented reality mobile game Pokémon GO in the Google Play Store, vaulting to the top of the free Android apps chart. The mobile-only app focuses on one-to-one video calls, and utilizes Web Real-Time Communication technology to make it very fast and end-to-end encryption to provide greater security for users. The app promises fewer dropped calls, and even supports handing off calls as the user switches between cellular and Wi-Fi connections. Duo also features the Knock-Knock feature, which provides the person that users are calling with a video preview of what the user looks like and what they are doing. Three Apps With Different Purposes Google's Hangouts, Allo and Duo apps are all made for different purposes. Erik Kay, Google's engineering director for communication software said that the company decided to make it that way to keep the apps light and finely tuned. Combining all the apps into one might burden it with too many features, and will weigh down the engineering team with so many decisions coming from previous products. Which Google communications app should you use? That would then depend on what you want to use the app for. Hangouts is great for collaboration, especially in business settings, with the app tied to Google for Work products and allowing for seamless communication between people in the office and people in the field. However, for users who would be mostly on their mobile devices, those who heavily use messaging might want to take a look at Allo, while those who have a preference for video calls should give Duo a try.

They won’t remember the finer details of their first league win in Stratford, and it’s probably just as well. Watford are the next league visitors here, but first, there’s a tricky trip to Manchester City. Bournemouth, pointless after two decent team efforts spoiled by individual errors, go to Crystal Palace. Today will at least linger in the memory of Michail Antonio, who wrote a little piece of history, and played himself out of defensive duties for the foreseeable future. That’s it from me; thanks for reading. Bye! Michail Antonio celebrates with Ashley Fletcher after the final whistle.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.05pm EDT 12:05 A couple of thoughts on the stadium – it looks the part, with the crowd close to the touchline thanks to those retractable stands, and the green felt around the pitch has been ironed out since the Europa League. The gap between the touchline and the dugouts is massive, but large technical areas allow the managers to keep a close eye on their charges. One gripe – the screens at either end are absurdly big. This isn’t the NFL. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.00pm EDT 12:00 “Re: 37 mins.

August Has Been A Super Exciting Month So Far For Linux / Open-Source Users Written by Michael Larabel in Free Software on 21 August 2016 at 09:52 AM EDT. 5 Comments Just over half-way through August, it's been a particularly exciting month for Linux and open-source fans. From Microsoft bringing PowerShell to Linux, Google working on a new operating system, AMD making open-source driver progress, Fedora 25 going ahead with Wayland by default, and more, there's been excitement for almost everyone this month. Given everything exciting that's been happening this month, I decided to do a quick recap of the most-viewed news so far on Phoronix this month, in case you've been out enjoying the summer and are behind on your reading. So far this month on Phoronix there have been 153 original news articles and the 12 most viewed include: Btrfs RAID 5/6 Code Found To Be Very Unsafe & Will Likely Require A Rewrite It turns out the RAID5 and RAID6 code for the Btrfs file-system's built-in RAID support is faulty and users should not be making use of it if you care about your data. Google Working On New "Fuchsia" Operating System, Powered By Magenta / LK Kernel Google appears to be working on a new operating system that's written from scratch and appears to be target both phones and PCs, among other form factors. Linux 4.7 - Btrfs vs. EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. XFS vs. NTFS Benchmarks Continuing on from yesterday's Linux 4.4 To 4.7 - EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. Btrfs Benchmarks comparison, here is a wider look at mainline file-systems on the Linux 4.7. File-systems tested on the NVMe SSD included Btrfs, EXT4, F2FS, XFS, and NTFS. Secure Boot Isn't So Secure After All: The Golden Key Is Out So much for Secure Boot being so secure... After a mistake by Microsoft, the "golden key" is now out in the wild. Systemd Rolls Out Its Own Mount Tool Systemd-mount is the newest tool added to systemd by Lennart Poettering.

BioShock Infinite Can Run More Than 23% Faster With New RadeonSI Patches Marek Olšák at AMD continues optimizing the RadeonSI Gallium3D driver for offering much better Linux gaming performance when using this open-source AMD graphics driver code. The latest are double-digit gains for at least the BioShock Infinite game. The Speed Of Ubuntu 16.10 Currently Versus Ubuntu 16.04, Clear Linux Being mid-way through Ubuntu 16.10's development cycle, here are some fresh benchmarks showing how its performance has changed (if at all) compared to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as well as compared to Intel's high-performance Clear Linux distribution as a reference point. Fedora 25 To Run Wayland By Default The Fedora Engineering and Steering Committee has decided that Fedora 25 will indeed ship the Wayland display server by default in place of the X.Org Server. Reboot Mode Driver Added To Linux 4.8 Kernel The power supply updates for Linux 4.8 adds a "reboot mode" driver to the kernel.

The most popular featured articles include: 18-Way GPU Linux Benchmarks, Including The Radeon RX 460 & RX 470 On Open-Source Yesterday I published early open-source benchmarks of the Radeon RX 470 while today is a full 18-way graphics card comparison including the newly-launched Radeon RX 460 and Radeon RX 470 graphics cards alongside the RX 480 Polaris graphics card. All of the AMD graphics cards tested for this article were running the very latest open-source driver stack on the Linux 4.8 kernel and Mesa 12.1-dev Git. Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 vs. Ubuntu Bash On Windows 10 Anniversary Performance When Microsoft and Canonical brought Bash and Ubuntu's user-space to Windows 10 earlier this year I ran some preliminary benchmarks of Ubuntu on Windows 10 versus a native Ubuntu installation on the same hardware. Now that this "Windows Subsystem for Linux" is part of the recent Windows 10 Anniversary Update, I've carried out some fresh benchmarks of Ubuntu running atop Windows 10 compared to Ubuntu running bare metal. Linux 4.4 To 4.7 - EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. Btrfs Benchmarks I've been a bit behind on my file-system benchmarking the past few months but for your viewing pleasure today are some EXT4 vs. Btrfs vs. F2FS file-system tests on an NVMe SSD when testing the Linux 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 kernels. Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu + Linux 4.7 + Mesa 12.1 Intel OpenGL Tests With Microsoft having recently released the Windows 10 Anniversary update I've been running some fresh Windows vs. Linux performance comparisons. The first of these comparisons for your viewing pleasure is looking at the latest Windows 10 build with the latest Intel driver compared to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS while also comparing the performance when manually upgrading to the Linux 4.7 kernel and Mesa 12.1-dev for delivering the latest OpenGL performance potential. Early Benchmarks Of FreeBSD 11.0 vs. DragonFlyBSD 4.6 vs. Linux Distributions Following last week's DragonFlyBSD 4.6 benchmarks I carried out a fresh comparison of FreeBSD 10.3 vs. FreeBSD 11.0 (Beta 4 at the time) along with the DragonFlyBSD results and a few of the popular Linux distributions. Here are those numbers. AMDGPU-PRO Radeon RX 460/470/480 vs. NVIDIA Linux GPU Benchmarks Last week I published an 18-way GPU Linux comparison featuring the new Radeon RX 460 and RX 470 graphics cards along with other AMD Radeon and NVIDIA GeForce GPUs. The Radeon tests were done using the very latest open-source Linux driver stack while in this article are similar benchmarks done but using the AMDGPU-PRO hybrid driver stack. The Many Exciting Features To The Linux 4.8 Kernel Today marks the closure of the Linux 4.8 kernel merge window so as usual here is our recap of all the features we've been monitoring over the past two weeks. Among the highlights for Linux 4.8 are AMD GPU OverDrive overclocking, initial NVIDIA Pascal support, a new ARM Mali display driver, mainline support for the Raspberry Pi 3 BCM SoC, HDMI CEC support, big reworks to Btrfs and XFS file-system code, and a number of new security features, among other changes. DragonFlyBSD 4.6 vs. Linux Benchmarks With DragonFlyBSD 4.6 having been released this week, here are benchmarks comparing its performance to that of the previous DragonFlyBSD 4.4 release as well as seeing how it compares to some Linux distributions. 4-Disk Btrfs RAID Benchmarks On Linux 4.7 Going along with the recent Linux 4.7 file-system benchmarks, here are some tests of Btrfs' built-in RAID functionality when tested on the Linux 4.7 kernel across four SATA SSDs. AMDGPU-PRO vs. Open-Source Gallium3D OpenGL Performance On Polaris Is A Very Tight Race For those wondering how AMD's hybrid "AMDGPU-PRO" Linux driver stack compares to the latest pure open-source driver stack of the AMDGPU kernel driver and RadeonSI Gallium3D driver, here are side-by-side results for the Radeon RX 460, RX 470, and RX 480 Polaris hardware as well as the R9 Fury (Fiji) graphics card.

RocketNews24 Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese TOP » Japan » Japanese pet owner’s dead cat miraculously appears on Google Street View Featured Weird Studio Ghibli Jobs Japanese pet owner’s dead cat miraculously appears on Google Street View Andrew Kane Aug 21, 2016 Tweet This cat owner experienced a bittersweet reunion when his departed cat made an unexpected reappearence on the popular navigation service, Google Street View. As a work of photography, the image itself doesn’t seem particularly impressive. The blurry screenshot shows a white cat with brown splotches on its tail and head slinking through a residential area. Nothing out of the ordinary it would seem, especially considering some of the more remarkable scenes that have surfaced on Google Street View over the years. Still, the tweet containing it has become a trending topic online, with the original post garnering thousands of likes as it circulates across the internet. So why’s everyone freaking out? Cue the X-Files theme, and refer below to the original tweet for the details of this phantom feline’s Lazarus moment. うおおおお！グーグルマップで亡くなった実家の猫発見した！！ https://t.co/juAPyweBgB— ひじから (@hijikara) August 16, 2016 In the tweet, Japanese twitter user @hijikara excitedly proclaims that he’s “found our cat that died on Google Maps!” It seems the user came across this photograph unexpectedly when looking at images of their hometown, as the cat passed away some time ago. Many users were quick to note the timely nature of this discovery. That’s because in Japan, August is a time for homecoming, when people return to their place of birth to celebrate a Buddhist holiday called “Obon.” According to traditional beliefs in Japan, Obon marks the time of year when spirits of the departed return home to Earth. Big cities, usually crowded with shoppers and office workers become quiet, and the crowds in public spaces grow sparse as millions travel back to smaller cities to spend time with family and honor the memories of departed loved-ones. Now it seems that it’s not only human souls that make this journey home. While similar cases of deceased relatives and friends appearing on Street View have occurred over the years, this discovery was all the more remarkable because this particular cat spent most of its life indoors. The owner says that the cat happened to have slipped outside the day the Google truck came around to survey the neighborhood. The mischievous feline presumably crossed paths with it as it was taking pictures of the area. ▼ One of Google’s Street View cameras doing its thing As a fellow animal lover and cat owner, I can’t help but feel a little emotional about this one. I can’t even muster any of my signature sarcastic quips! The owner still probably misses their pet, but the story offers a nice, though poignant, reminder of an old friend.

Automotive Law Legal Issues Technology Information technology Mobility Photo by Getty Images/iStockphoto Thus far, the tech and auto industries have played nice, largely because of the use of joint development agreements. Other stories from this special report U.S. patent surge: 1994-2014 Dustin Walsh: Pro bono IP work a growing service Oakland County company settles eye care formula lawsuits with Bausch & Lomb As the West Coast's largest technology companies jump deeper into the automotive landscape, fears of increased litigation are bubbling in Southeast Michigan. In May, FCA US LLC and California's Google Inc. signed an agreement to jointly develop 100 autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans. Apple, and its Birmingham office, work to extend its Beats by Dre audio brand in FCA products. Ford Motor Co. and Google were rumored to be signing an agreement, but the deal fell through. Greg DeGrazia, partner and intellectual property attorney at law firm Warner Norcross and Judd LLP in Southfield, said that as the tech and auto industries continue to merge, a clash is on the horizon. "We're running toward a major issue, frankly," DeGrazia said. "While suppliers are scared to sue someone like General Motors because they could go out of business without the orders, companies like Google and Apple are not intimidated by GM, Ford or anyone else." Historically, automakers have always been the biggest player in the room in any negotiation. Not anymore. Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., has a market value near $550 billion, and Apple's market value is more than $585 billion, compared to Ford and GM at less than $50 billion and FCA at less than $9 billion. Apple generated revenue of $233.7 billion in 2015, more than $80 billion more than Detroit's biggest automaker, GM, which reported revenue of $152.4 billion last year. Google, for instance, has enough cash on hand — more than $9 billion in the second quarter — to buy FCA outright. Plus, the major U.S. tech players, including Google, Apple and Microsoft Inc., are litigious in protecting intellectual property. The trio has been involved in more than 1,100 patent lawsuits in the past 10 years, compared to the Detroit 3's 204, DeGrazia said. "Look at the judgments coming out of the cellphone wars," DeGrazia said. "Imagine what the damages could be for 10 million cars." In recent years, Apple has won more than $1 billion in damages in patent infringement cases against Korean cellphone maker Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., which uses Google's Android operating system, though many of those cases have been appealed and some overturned. "What if Google or Apple gets boxed out of the industry? Then they go on the offensive," DeGrazia said. "I fully anticipate patent infringement lawsuits in the pipeline." Thus far, the two industries have played nice, largely because of the use of joint development agreements (JDAs), said Martin Sultana, partner and IP attorney at Brooks Kushman PC in Southfield. Agreements with partners within the traditional auto supply chain can save time and smooth development, especially where patents exist. Advantages are magnified when auto companies dive into areas in which engineers have little experience — such as new software. "The perception is always that the auto companies better be on the lookout because of Apple and Google," Sultana said. "What they fail to realize is that Silicon Valley needs the auto industry just as much as the auto industry needs Silicon Valley. Working together, nicely, provides a significant advantage to getting autonomous vehicles out in the marketplace." Sultana said the JDAs are being driven by business decisions, and the auto companies realize Apple and Google are the enablers to get auto customers what they want and it behooves both industries to work toward fair deals. But those deals can be complicated, said Claudia Rast, partner at Butzel Long PC in Ann Arbor. Dealing with huge tech companies presents a different dynamic for auto companies, which are used to dictating most of the terms of an agreement to their suppliers. "It's very dynamic right now," Rast said. "The typical (automaker) model of buying tech and owning it doesn't work in this space. The big players out of California carry the big stick, so there's a lot of negotiating going on." Sultana said the biggest hurdle in the negotiation process is determining the value of the IP. "Not knowing the value, or future value, of the technology creates the biggest pitfalls," Sultana said. "But there's nothing in the legal framework that can't be overcome. If you've got two parties that want to engage in a joint development, they can make it happen." In some cases, auto companies are choosing to acquire outright advanced technologies instead of creating JDAs with the tech world's most powerful players. In May, GM closed on a $1 billion acquisition of San Francisco startup Cruise Automation. Cruise manufactures an aftermarket, roof-mounted autonomous-driving kit. For GM the deal provides access to Cruise's "deep software talent and rapid development capability to further accelerate" GM's development of autonomous vehicles. The acquisition is likely to represent one of the largest automotive M&A deals of the year and a deal that shows auto companies' escalating approach to buy technology. The total value of automotive supplier deals in 2015 and 2016 was $74.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with each of those years far exceeding the $17.7 billion annual average in the previous 10 years. The number of transactions valued at $500 million or more also skyrocketed to 18 last year, triple the level of the previous decade. "Automotive bankers are definitely spending more time in places like Silicon Valley," Christian Kames, Citigroup Inc.'s head of investment banking for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the global co-head of automotive, told Automotive News earlier this month. "The focus areas are electronics, communications and software. In the past, most suppliers didn't really have that kind of technology, but they now know they need to have it to set the industry standards for the future." Suppliers are also joining the fold of acquiring tech in lieu of signing JDAs. Last year, Southfield-based Lear Corp. acquired the intellectual property and technology of Santa Rosa, Calif.-based Autonet Mobile Inc., an internet-based telematics and app service provider for the automotive market, and Troy-based Arada Systems Inc., which is bringing to market a completely integrated modular unit that connects vehicles to infrastructure, other vehicles and the cloud. Connecting vehicles to infrastructure and other vehicles is designed to increase safety by enabling the ability to monitor traffic, push safety warnings or allow better traffic flow. The unit will be modular enough to upgrade the hardware easily, focused on security and software capable of over-the-air updates. Lear has since renamed its electrical business segment E-Systems to better reflect the complexity of its automotive electrical systems. "There's still plenty of room for the smaller tech companies to get into automotive," Rast said. "It's very disruptive. We're seeing medical device makers and companies designing 'wearables' technology looking to incorporate that tech in the car." Sultana said, though, as more and more tech comes online, the winning formulas will result in more JDA agreements and less acquisition activity. "Once the tech starts to mature, the concrete starts to dry, you may see more action down the road," Sultana said. "We'll see JDAs from either coast getting more action." DeGrazia, however, warns that when the tech does mature, the problems escalate. "It's a storm on the horizon," he said. "Google and the others are going to make money on their patent portfolio. There's no walking it back. Auto patent infringement lawsuits start rising as soon as autonomous vehicles hit the road."

For those who do not know what Chrome apps are, they include – Google Drive, Google Store, Calendar, Google news, Google Docs, Sheets, and more. Most of these apps are already hosted as regular web apps. There are a lot of apps on the Chrome Web Store, which can be downloaded and launched through your Chrome browser and they open in a separate window – just like if a programme was installed on the computer. “Today, approximately 1% of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps. All types of Chrome apps will remain supported and maintained on Chrome OS for the foreseeable future. Additional enhancements to the Chrome apps platform will apply only to Chrome OS devices, including kiosks. Developers can continue to build Chrome apps (or Android apps) for Chrome OS,” said Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, VP Product Management at Google Chrome, in a blog post. According to the post, new Chrome apps will only be available to users on Chrome OS starting late 2016. The Chrome apps that have been developed until that date will remain accessible to users across all platforms, with developers having continued access to update them. “In the second half of 2017, the Chrome Web Store will no longer show Chrome apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but will continue to surface extensions and themes. In early 2018, users on these platforms will no longer be able to load Chrome apps,” Chowdhury added in the post.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Google Nexus 7 2016 Reportedly to Do Away with the Nexus Brand and Settle for the G Logo! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: August 22, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Although the Nexus brand has always been identified with Google, there are a good number of smartphone and tablet manufacturers that also come out with Nexus devices including Motorola, Asus, Huawei, HTC, among others. But the American tech company wants to change all of that with the upcoming Google Nexus 7 2016, which according to reports shall come out in two models – the Sailfish and the Marlin. Apart from the remarkable features of the two Nexus 7 2016 smartphone variants now making the rounds online, the upcoming Android smartphones from Google shall reportedly do away with the Nexus brand and will just sport the G logo, alluding to Google as a brand, reports the University Herald. As has been reported previously, the Google Nexus 7 2016 smartphones shall come out with Android 7.0 Nougat already onboard. They would be, in fact, the first devices that shall come out with the latest Android mobile operating system. Reports also have it that the Google Nexus 7 2016 devices shall boast of exclusive Nougat features including a unique launcher, a user interface, and a never-before-seen animated home button. Locking horns with Apple’s latest iPhones With the launching of the next iPhones from Apple just around the corner, there are also speculations saying that the two variants of the Google Nexus 7 2016 shall lock horns or go head-to-head with the latest iPhones. It is possible that the iPhone 7 shall go up with the Sailfish while the Marlin will be pitted against the bigger iPhone 7 Plus. Based on previous reports, the 5-inch Sailfish could have up to 32GB of internal storage while the 5.5-inch Marlin shall have a massive 128GB of internal memory, both with options for further expansion through a microSD card slot, which the iPhones simply do not have. From a previous August launching date, latest reports or rumors are now saying that the Google Nexus 7 2016 devices could come out before Thanksgiving, which means late in November, notes the Christian Today. It may be a good strategy on the part of Google in order to capitalize on the holiday shopping spree but the Android 7.0 Nougat would come out rather late in the process. Latest Android mobile operating system normally comes out before October so a November release date for the Nougat seems strange. That being said, everything remains speculation at this time pending the confirmation from Google. Best Stock Android devices ever The Google Nexus 7 2016 shall reportedly come out via two premium handsets, which according to the hype shall be the best Stock Android devices ever to come out. Firing up the new Stock Android smartphones is the latest and greatest chipset from Qualcomm. It shall also include Vulkan graphics support and OpenGL 3.0 support. It has also been reported that the Google Nexus 7 2016 shall have significant shooting refinement and enhancements with the reported inclusion of the Sony IMX179 camera sensor. What seems consistent with the rumors for the device is that it shall come out with two variants, which are going to be called as the Marlin and the Sailfish. There have been reports that the two variants of the Google Nexus 7 2016 shall be made in collaboration with HTC or Huawei or both, which means that one could focus on the manufacture of the other while the other shall focus on the development of the other. The consensus is that HTC may be tasked to manufacture the high-end Marlin while Huawei can be tapped to develop the Sailfish. However, these remain as speculations at this time pending the confirmation from Google. Interestingly, there are now reports saying that the Nexus 7 2016 could also be refreshed by Taiwanese tech firm Asus. Apparently, Asus is the original maker of the Nexus 7 and the company even came out with at least two generations of the phablet previously.

The rest consists of links (more than 600) and scripts of all types (120 references), related to trackers, advertising objects, analytics, etc. As I wrote in this previous Monday Note, the sole Chartbeat analytics trackers requires 29,000 characters of code! It would be useful to know how the amount of code used on their website correlates with the Guardian’s abysmal financial losses. (Sad humor, I’m a big fan of The Guardian.) The Guardian is a kind of extreme when it comes to bloated HTML. In due fairness, this cataract of code loads very fast on a normal connection. The Guardian technical team was also the first one to devise a solid implementation of Google’s new Accelerated Mobile Page (AMP) format. In doing so, it eliminated more than 80% of the original code, making it blazingly fast on a mobile device. As an admittedly biased reference point, I took one of the first texts, the “World Wide Web Summary,” written in HTML by its inventor Tim Berners-Lee. Published in 1991, it probably is one of the purest, most barebones forms of hypertext markup language: 4,200 characters of readable text for less than 4,600 characters of code. That’s a 90% usefulness rate, as shown in the table below (you can also refer to my original Google Sheet here to get precise numbers, stories, URLs, and formulae). (Monday Note) This selection is arbitrary but nonetheless interesting to look at. Aside from the original Berners-Lee text, it includes, on line two, a Washington Post article coded in the experimental Progressive Web App format (more on this in a moment), a classic HTML Politico story, a piece from the official AMP Blog (hopefully coded in AMP), a past Monday Note column published on Medium (which tweaked the W3 standards), a NYT piece, The Guardian piece coded in AMP, a short piece from the MailOnline embedded in a 40-scrolls webpage (remarkably optimized), a WaPo story, and the original Guardian one. Two observations: If we cut the extreme cases out, the “pure” Berners-Lee and the heavy Guardian one, we see a ratio ranging from 4.55% to 9% of readable text over underlying HTML. The least optimized is the Washington Post that doesn’t mind a large HTML file for reading on a desktop as it offers alternative formats. The lightest (relatively speaking) is Politico, which maintains a simple page structure. The big surprise (at least for me) comes from the Progressive Web App implemented by the Washington Post. The Plain HTML page offers roughly the same content as the PWA version, but with a huge gain in HTML size. (Monday Note) PWA was created by Google about a year ago. It’s a hybrid sitting between mobile apps and mobile sites. According to its official developers blog, it features the following: (Google) Google is just starting to promote the PWA on a large scale, and the tools are already available. While it has been already implemented by the giant Indian retailer Flipkart, the Post is the first news publisher to experiment with it (the pages are still a little buggy and don’t support ads yet). Because it supports Push notifications and other features until now reserved to native apps, PWA has great potential for publishers—as long as it doesn’t end up in Google’s graveyard of innovations lost in some murky internal quagmire…). Regardless of promising innovations, the war to reduce HTML’s bloat remains to be won. Many forces—advertising technologies, user profiling, endless analytics, trackers—might conspire to eat all the benefits promised by the proposed new standard.

Header Right Microsoft Android Apple Games Contact Us You are here: Home / Technology / Google Allo Resembles WhatsApp But Is Looking Great Google Allo Resembles WhatsApp But Is Looking Great Aug 21, 2016 By Aditya One of the most audacious apps that are released by Google in recent times is Google Allo. By this Google is seemingly trying to catch up in one stroke with the release along with the competing apps for messaging which have been available for the users for a lot of years now and have had enough time to perfect their approach the audiences and they will also stop investing hugely in the Google Hangouts which is fairly going nowhere. It does seem normal that Google Allo team had some inspiration from other already existing messaging apps. But when we look at the screenshots that we have obtained of Google Allo resembles WhatsApp a lot. With the resemblance, wither the team of Google Allo really liked the way WhatsApp handles some of the functions, or they simply did not want to turn the wheel of technology and risk doing something that may or may not revolutionize the way we communicate. Or they might just want to provide something that already exists and the people are familiar with in order to not intimidate the public. One of the aspects of Google Allo which is most resembling to WhatsApp is it’s voice messaging UI. If you have ever used WhatsApp then you will find it more refined and if you have never used WhatsApp then you will find it very neat. The voice messaging works when you tap the bottom right of the text entry box has a microphone and when you tap it, it will cover the bottom right of the screen and you need to keep your finger as you speak for it to record. You can see the duration of it on the left of the text entry box and when you are done speaking you just need to release your finger from the screen and if you want to delete the voice message then just drag the microphone to the left side and it will be deleted. You see how this resembles WhatsApp right?

First of all, the company is all set to release their new OS and their new devices. The Google Nexus series is all set to get two new smartphones from HTC. In addition to that, they are also planning two new smartwatches. However, the second big thing that Google is working on is getting the IM apps out. Google Duo came out last week, and it is expected that Google Allo too, would be out in a week or two. While no details are known to us at the moment, it is heavily speculated that the app will be out before the new Nexus smartphones come out. The Google Allo Instant Messaging app is yet to arrive. However, we did get a few sneak peeks into it earlier, thanks to Android Police. Yesterday we saw some ‘inappropriate’ stickers, followed by the knowledge of the app having the ability to delete messages. Today, Android Police has released more details. It has now come to light that the voice-messaging feature in Google Allo looks quite similar to that of WhatsApp’s. One might say that it is a near rip-off! While the overall interface of Google Allo looks neater than that of WhatsApp, the voice calling is nearly the same! The company not only has similar buttons, which also animate in the same manner, but even the cancellation of a message is similar! While this new app from Google does bring in a few new elements, and clears what one might call ‘clutter’ from WhatsApp, the similarity here is uncanny! However, it looks like Google took the high way here, and decided to cut out on these aspects. The company would rather invest their time in developing something that is dramatically different. It looks like more of an intellectual investment has been done in the creation of the Google Assistant. More details on Google Allo are likely to roll out as the days progress.

Apparently, the app is still not available for download via the Play Store or Apple App Store. But still, this doesn’t mean we can’t get our hands on what this Google Allo app is all about. With Google marketing these two apps as the simplest and easiest to use when it comes to handling their respective tasks, be ready for apps that are very “small” when it comes to features. Google Duo has a feature known as Knock Knock. With this feature, users can see the background of the caller even before they answer the call. On the opposite end, Google Allo has the ability to delete messages from a conversation, a feature that is expected to help drive masses towards downloading the app, especially those with concerns about their privacy. The option to delete messages from a given conversation is one of the best things that can happen to an IM. In fact, this feature sits high on the priority list of most users when it comes to choosing which app to use for communication purposes. Considering that Google Hangouts doesn’t offer such a feature, the implementation of the delete function in Google Allo will for sure help grab the attention of not just current users of Hangouts, but also those on other messaging apps. Don’t expect anything strange with this Google Allo implementation. All one will need to do is select a given message they want to delete and get rid of it, but apparently, it is still not possible to do so for multiple messages in a conversation.  Although this feature is only available on the beta version of the app, there are chances that Google will launch the full version with a much more enhanced delete function. Who knows, the app could come with a feature similar to disappearing messages, but probably with a different implementation like with the case of Yahoo Messenger. With Google Allo also dealing with media files, the delete function also incorporates such files. According to Android Police, selecting a media file, for instance, a photo, for deletion purposes will prompt a message asking whether you also want to delete the same photo from your device’s storage. Google Allo should be released very soon now that Google Duo is already out.

New Delhi, Aug 21:   Railways will collaborate with Google for digitising and showcasing its heritage on digital platforms. Google has agreed to partner with Railways to digitise its heritage assets and help create a digital repository for universal online access free of cost, said a senior Railway Ministry official. Indian Railway has a huge list of heritage assets including bridges, steam locos, buildings, artefacts and museums which can be showcased for global audience. Cultural collaboration An agreement in this regard will be signed soon between National Rail Museum and Google Cultural Institute (GCI). GCI is a non-profit organisation that partners with cultural organisations to bring world’s cultural heritage online. GCI builds online tools and offers them to institutions for showcasing and sharing cultural assets. The official said collaboration will not only make NRM accessible online and offer virtual tours but also help digitise the national transporter’s entire heritage inventory which includes more than 20 museums, hundreds of steam locos, coaches, station buildings, bridges among others. “Once these are placed online, it will act as a great tourist attraction,” he said. GCI generally works with government organisations and not for profit groups to provide digital collection management systems and storytelling tools free of cost. Various ministries and institutes of the government have already collaborated with GCI for displaying and preserving India’s cultural heritage digitally. Currently Google is working with the railways in providing free Wi-Fi service at 100 stations. Indian Railway is preparing a comprehensive conservation management plan to preserve and promote its heritage assets. Besides, a dedicated rail heritage website under Railway Board’s website is operational for dissemination of information.

I hope others will follow your lead. (I see the sky as not fallen.) As someone who, as a result of the out of control excesses of the tracking industry, does not want to be tracked other than for essential purposes, and mostly browses on mobile, the advice to use the Do Not Track options is however typically not viable for me: these tools are desktop centric, and do not work on iOS browser, or any system that is trying to decline third party trackers. It is bizarre, an indicator of the tacking industry’s apparent contempt for the intelligence or interests of its subjects, to be told by them: “if you do not want third party cookies our solution is you have to accept third party cookies!” Regards, David Reply Jesse.com says: August 20, 2016 at 5:11 pm I don’t mind cookies being used what I do mind is that the private policy terms and conditions apply and are verified by users consistent. I am having trouble, my information is being breached and would like to more about finding out who it is not only stopping it. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

President Donald Trump: A MENA perspective Home  >  Technology  >  Telecom  >  Move over, FaceTime – Google Duo is here AMEinfo EXPERTS Money Matters by Ambareen Musa Souqalmal.com Talking Tech by Faisal Al Bannai DarkMatter VIEW ALL EXPERTS Move over, FaceTime – Google Duo is here August 17, 2016 5:16 pm Erik Kay, engineering director at Google, introduces Allo and Duo on stage during the Google I/O 2016 developers conference in Mountain View, California. (Image: Reuters) Google has launched a new application allowing video calls, creating a rival for apps such as Apple’s FaceTime, Microsoft’s Skype, Facebook’s Messenger and Google’s own Hangout app.“Today, we’re releasing Google Duo – a simple 1-to-1 video calling app available for Android and iOS,” Justin Uberti, Principal Software Engineer at Google, wrote in a blog post announcing the launch of the application. “Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are,” Uberti added. Not to be too invasive, Google Duo includes a feature called “Knock Knock”, which allows a person to see a live video of the caller before answering the call. “For video calls on the go, Duo will switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call. You can start your call at home and continue seamlessly even when you head out the door,” Uberti said. Google said the app will be available to users worldwide in the next few days. With a saturation of video-calling apps, it might get confusing to know which is the best one to use when living in the Middle East. To make a primary distinction, below is a list of featuring differentiating Duo from its sister application, Hangouts.   Duo Available on iOS and Android products Allows one-on-one conversations only Uses mobile numbers to make the connection without the need for special user names – so no separate account is required. Call quality adjusts to network conditions. When network is weak Duo “gracefully” reduces the resolution of the call to keep callers connected and keep the conversation ongoing. Duo calls are “end-to-end encrypted” to maintain privacy and security of the calls. Knock Knock feature can be disabled or limited to a user’s contact list. No audio-only option. Can only be used on mobile phones or tablets.   Hangouts Allows conference calls between multiple users Can be used on desktop Allows messaging Reaches users through Gmail Tags: By AMEinfo Staff AMEinfo staff members report business news and views from across the Middle East and North Africa region, and analyse global events impacting the region today.

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. On the borderline in between Tennessee and Arkansas, Memphis is the largest and westernmost metropolis in the state, and the largest on the Mississippi River. Founded in founded in 1819 by a group of wealthy Americans including judge John Overton and future president Andrew Jackson, the city is noted these days for the growth of its downtown area. The home of “Elvis”, is also home to a thriving business sector powered by fortune 500 companies  FedEx, International Paper, and AutoZone. As for the real estate market online, Memphis is not unlike so many other towns we have surveyed. Most agencies have turned to Google ads, Zillow and Trulia, Remax, and the typical cookie cutter suspects, and have essentially given up on any hands on media distribution. There are a few exceptions though no real estate player even appears on page one for search. Here is a rundown of resident Realtors actually doing the work of commerce online. Marx-Bensdorf is nothing out of the ordinary Marx-Bensdorf Realtors Situated at the top of page two of Google for the search term “Memphis Real Estates”, Marx-Bensdorf is celebrating 145 years in the Memphis area. The three dozen or so agents here look to President Jimmy Reed for guidance in serving Memphis property clients and buyers. As you can tell from the screenshot of the company’s website above, “typical” is what to expect from this company’s effort to utilize mobile and online channels. The digital rundown is as follows: Estimated visitors per month – Alexa 3 million plus – gets (amazingly) 300 + visitors a month Facebook – 1604 fans, with scattered post frequency Twitter Engagement – Joined 2009 – 263 followers – they gave up LinkedIn – 64 followers – profile essentially unused Google “Mobile Friendly Test” – Passed On the bright side of this Realtor’s footprint, the blog shows a lot of promise compared to many competitors we have looked at. However, the lack of proper SEO function virtually assures even fresh content will be ignored. My initial thoughts here are; “If this is the best Memphis has to offer….” This agent gets a 4 on a scale of 10. Sowell & Company’s website leaves a good first impression, but the wonder stops here Sowell & Company First of all, this company has a very nice, tailored website. I love the slate green color scheme. Whoever approved the web design had a flair for crisp corporate style, I’ll give them this. The texts however, leave a lot to be desired keyword SEO relevance wise, and the site reads like a closing lawyer wrote the content. Whew! Now that that’s all out of the bag, the company is all but invisible to anyone searching Memphis for a house. Once again a major agency has hired a website built, got some freelance writer to type out some texts, and “set it and let it” online. As I type this, I cannot actually believe Memphis Realtors can be worse than Pittsburgh ones. Let’s move on. Estimated visitors per month – Alexa 1.9 million plus – 1,520 visitors a month and rising Facebook – 168 fans, and a waste of time engagement Twitter Engagement – Joined 2010 – 27 followers – never engaged LinkedIn – 44 followers – Linda Sowell has a personal profile Google “Mobile Friendly Test” – Passed Principal Broker Linda Sowell is almost more prevalent as a brand online than her real estate company is. I don’t want to seem like I am agency bashing here, but what a colossal waste of time this company’s online billboards are. This agent gets a 1 on a scale of 10, and only by virtue of the fact somebody created a digital footprint at all. Spake.com will not be seen in the Louvre anytime soon, but the site works for minimalism Spake.com Joe Spake is in the top 1% of socially engaged real estate people on this globe, I am sure. A contributor to RealtyBizNews many times, Joe is on every social media channel that counts, and in a big way. To be honest, I am a bit puzzled as to why his Spake.com is not listed higher by Google? Perhaps the ads have really taken over the show for Memphis. It may also be relevant that the Spake website is not really optimized aesthetically or SEO wise, but I’ve not the deep intel to glean this. What I can say is, Joe’s going “minimalist” was a good move, if an ugly one. As you can see from the screenshot above, Spake.com is not Sotheby’s. That said, Joe is super engaged for his clients. Estimated visitors per month – Alexa 5.4 million plus –  600 – 1000 visitors a month and rising Facebook – 1193 fans, mirrors everything from Twitter etc… Twitter Engagement – Joined 2008 – 5961 followers – top notch Tweeting LinkedIn – 500+ followers – top notch profile and recommendations Google “Mobile Friendly Test” – Passed Spake.com should rank higher than it does, even against the massive branding Zillow and the others get from their ads and overall reach. That said, Joe could also spiffy up the website for more curb appeal too. The Google indexes for his site are massive, so I am suspicious about the SEO effort as well. However marginal this website may be though, Joe Spake’s social effort is second to none. I give him a 7 out of 10 for serving clients well online. (Let me send you a WordPress theme Joe) Functional, JudyMac’s site needs a makeover even if Judy does not JudyMac Judy O. McLellan is a Crye-Leike Real Estate legend in the Mid-South region. Personable to a flaw, this Germantown, Tennessee broker is what I would call an “organically successful” property professionally. What I mean by this is, she seems about as genuinely friendly and professional as they come. Her Facebook and other social efforts attest to what I am saying here. On the down side of online presence though, Web 1.0 bill-boarding has been out 20 years. The JudyMac website is only surpassed in ugliness by Joe Spake’s aesthetically anemic one above. If that sounds harsh to some of you, imagine a home buyer dropping in, leaving, and never, ever, ever coming back. Now that I have beaten the signage drum loudly, let’s look at what Judy does best. Estimated visitors per month – Alexa 14 million plus –  100 – 500 visitors a month max Facebook – 2358 fans on her personal profile Twitter Engagement – Joined 2009 – 3034 followers – super engaged LinkedIn – 500+ followers – top notch profile and recommendations Google “Mobile Friendly Test” – Ooops! Failed – the first ever in our series on agents Judy McLellan clearly relies on the power of her company’s Crye-Leike site presence, so it’s a bit unfair to criticize so adamantly her website. Other than this “spot” on her digital effort, the Memphis broker is straight up stellar in her endeavors for clients. So, she gets a 7 out of 10 too. Fast Track Realty’s website is “nice” … but not memorable … and memorable is the goal Fast Track Realty Begun in 2009 by Beth & Greg Glosson, this Memphis area agency landed on page three of Google, which means nobody in their right mind visits the site from organic search. People just don’t scan search pages to find a home in Memphis, Trulia and Zillow, Google Ads took care of that potential. Estimated visitors per month – Alexa 14 million plus –  100 to nobody Facebook – 999 fans – very nice posts Twitter Engagement – Joined 2013 – 8838 followers – some fake, maybe bought LinkedIn – 5 followers – not yet developed Google “Mobile Friendly Test” – passed These fake followers follow a thousands and Tweet nothing – 3rd parties sell such fans Looking at Fast Track’s Twitter social profile I find some fake followers. The high number of fans given the late engagement in 2013 clued me into the possibility the agency bought some followers. While this is not illegal or totally unwise, using Twitter profile ads is the best way to achieve this. Third party follower services are unscrupulous generally. This real estate presence shows some potential, even despite the mistake of boosting Twitter like mad. Fast Track gets a 4 out of 10 with hope for the future.

Even as she gave her best and tried to outrun two-time world champion Carolina Marin of Spain, netizens were busy searching for her caste-identity on Google. First pointed out by one Vivekanand Nagarajan on his Facebook wall, and later verified by Google Trends statistics, the data suggests that many Indians were more curious about "pv Sindhu caste" over the last week than they have been about her live match scores. When one typed 'pv' on Google search, the suggestions that came up automatically were pv sindhu, pv sindhu match, pv sindhu wiki and pv sindhu caste. Most of the searches were made from Vijaywada (Andhra Pradesh), Secundarabad (Telangana), Vishakapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Hyderabad. Coach Pullela Gopichand's wasn't spared as well. Many sought to know his caste credentials as well. National newspaper The Hindu, on Saturday, reported that while Andhra Pradesh claimed Sindhu was their ‘ammayi’ or daughter, Telangana residents branded her as their “bidda” with some even posting images of the player carrying the traditional Bonam at the recent Bonalu festival in Hyderabad to justify their claim. The paper went on to say that people looked up her caste also because her parents had a love marriage, a situation where caste differences are often ignored. Sindhu was born and brought up in Hyderabad but her mother belongs to Vijayawada. After her match, the Andhra Pradesh government announced a slew of rewards, including a cash award of Rs 3 crore. "We will give her 1,000 sq yds of house site in the state's new capital Amaravati and also a Group-1 officer post in the state government. She can choose the post she wants," Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu announced. Not to be outdone, the Telangana government announced a cash reward of Rs 5 crore. "There is a need to encourage sports personalities. Like Sania Mirza, who brought laurels by winning several tournaments after encouragement by the government, we hope Sindhu will also bring many laurels by winning many more tournaments in the future. She is coming to Hyderabad on August 22. The Cabinet has decided to accord her a grand reception," Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao told reporters. However, Sindhu's parents had the final word on the matter. Seeking to lay the matter to rest, Sindhu's mother Vijayalakshmi said her girl is an Indian first. "Let us all enjoy this moment of triumph and look forward to a golden finish and not engage in a debate," she said.

Published Aug 21, 2016, 10:03 am IST Updated Aug 21, 2016, 10:10 am IST Google to gradually phase out Chrome Apps for non-Chrome operating systems.  Google believes it’s time to begin the evolution away from the Chrome app platform. Google launched Chrome apps approximately 3 years ago. This was done with the purpose of bridging the gap that existed between web and certain, more efficient experiences such as working offline, sending notifications and connecting to hardware. However, Google believes it’s time to begin the evolution away from the Chrome app platform. They have decided to remove support for packaged and hosted apps from Chrome on Windows, Mac and Linux over the next two years. What does this mean? While, all types of Chrome apps will remain supported and maintained on Chrome OS; additional enhancements to the Chrome apps platform will apply only to Chrome OS devices. By the second half of 2017, the Chrome Web Store will no longer show Chrome apps on Windows, Mac and Linux but will continue to surface extensions and themes. As posted on their blog: ‘On Windows, Mac, and Linux, we encourage developers to migrate their Chrome apps to the web. Developers who can’t fully move their apps to the web can help us prioritize new APIs to fill the gaps left by Chrome apps. In the short term, they can also consider using a Chrome extension or platforms such as Electron or NW.js. ‘ Tags: google chrome, chrome apps, chrome os, operating systems Nation Gallery INS Chennai commissioned, largest-ever warship to be built in India Patna-Indore Express derails in Kanpur, scores killed Long queues at ATMs after Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes ban Theresa May lays groundwork for post-Brexit India trade deal 'Smoky' future for our children?

Featured Story: 5 Things You Didn't Know Your iPhone's Home Button Could Do iOS Gadget Hacks: Unchaining iPhone & iPad to get tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Transfer Your Android Contacts to iPhone Dallas Thomas 3 weeks ago How to Transfer Your Android Contacts to iPhone When you change smartphone ecosystems, there are a lot of minor hurdles to clear along the way. It's definitely not hard to switch from Android to iOS, but little things like making sure your contacts get transferred over can take a bit of work. So if you've recently ditched your old Android device and upgraded to an iPhone, and you're missing all of your email addresses and phone numbers, you'll need to export your contacts from Google, then import them to iCloud. Luckily, though, it's a fairly simple process, and all you need is a Mac or a Windows PC to do it. Don't Miss: 23 Important Apps That Work Great on Both Android & iOS Note: Apple does have an Android app called Move to iOS that makes it easy to transfer all your content, including contacts, but you have to use it during the initial setup of your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. Plus, it's overkill if you're just trying to get your contacts on iOS, so the manual way below is the better way to go. Step 1: Export Your Google Contacts To start, head to the Google Contacts page, then make sure you're signed in with the same Google account you used on your Android device. Google is in the process of debuting a new Contacts website, and the new version doesn't allow you to export your contacts just yet. Some users may see this new website when they click the above link, and others will still see the old page. The new Contacts page can be distinguished by the blue bar across the top of the screen, so if you see this after clicking the above link, expand the "More" category on the left-hand side, then click "Leave the Contacts preview." When you do that, you'll automatically be redirected to the old Contacts site. From here, click the check box near the top of your screen to select all of your contacts. Next, click the "More" drop-down menu, then choose "Export" from the list. From here, choose "Selected contacts" on the popup, then make sure to select "vCard format." Once you've done that, simply click the "Export" button, then a .vcf file will be saved to your downloads folder. Step 2: Import Your Contacts to iCloud Next up, head to iCloud.com online, then log in with the Apple ID you use on your new iPhone. From here, select the "Contacts" option. After that, click the gear icon in the bottom-left corner of the page, then select "Import vCard." Next, use the file browser menu to select the vCard file you downloaded from Google Contacts, then click "Open," and your contacts will be imported momentarily.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Windows-Windows+ iOS-iOS+ BlackBerry-BlackBerry+ Android-Android+ According to the latest data from Statista, Android handsets made up 86.2% of smartphones sold globally during the first half of the year. The previous high water mark, 84.7%, was set in the third quarter of 2015. Sales of iPhone units (12.9%) are in a recent downtrend, but the platform is firmly lodged in second place with Windows Phone and BlackBerry sliding into oblivion. Interestingly, for the second quarter of 2009 it was Symbian that led the way with a 51% share of global sales. BlackBerry was next with 19%, followed by iOS with 13%. 9% of global smartphone sales in that quarter belonged to Windows Mobile and Android brought up the rear at 2% Basically, Apple has held a steady share of sales since, while all other platforms saw its users leave for Android. By the first quarter of 2011, Android sales topped those of Symbian and Google's open source OS never looked back again. During the second quarter of this year, 296.91 million Android phones were shipped globally compared with 44.4 million iPhone models. 1.97 million Windows Phone units were delivered, and 400,000 BlackBerry handsets were in transit. Compare that to the second quarter of 2009 when 20.88 million Symbian phones were shipped. BlackBerry had 7.78 million handsets delivered during those three months. 5.33 million iPhones were in transit followed by 3.83 million Windows Mobile units. Only 760,000 Android handsets were shipped during Q2 of 2009. It's all fascinating stuff, and for those of us who were writing about the industry during this time period, it was obvious that a change was coming. We often refer to the launch of the Motorola DROID in November 2009 as being the catalyst for Android's amazing rise. It was the first phone with Android 2.0. Consider that the quarter before the DROID was released, 760,000 Android phones were shipped. By the the first quarter of 2010, 5.23 million Android handsets were delivered. And with the Nexus One released that quarter, shipments soared to 10.65 million during Q2 of 2010.

Scott93274 (Posts: 4946; Member since: 06 Aug 2013) lol, dude, your comment "3 short years ago it was almost 50% iOS" was proven wrong by this very article, you simply had to look at the charts provided. iOS and Android had about an even market share in early 2010, and even then, there were several other competitors on the market fighting for relevance so even then, Apple wasn't anywhere near 50% market share. And the only reason why iOS isn't number one right now is because Apple was incredibly shortsighted and signed a contract with AT&T making the iPhone exclusive to that carrier until early 2011 allowing the rest of the world to accept the alternative mobile OS, Android. posted on 21 Aug 2016, 13:58 0 in response to #97 in response to #97 Hide Reply 98. kiko007 (Posts: 2987; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) To this day, I still think that decision was stupid on Apple's part.

Scott93274 (Posts: 4946; Member since: 06 Aug 2013) No joke, it's the difference between 13% and 86% market share. Yes, Apple is doing well for the share they currently have, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to what they could have had if they hadn't denied the rest of the world the opportunity to buy their product. Instead, they left the door wide open for competition to fill the void. Which in the end, it's a good thing that things went the way they did, at least for a consumer standpoint.

BobbyDigital (Posts: 2026; Member since: 29 May 2014) I believe they went exclusive with At&t because no other carrier thought the iPhone would sell. Verizon flat out denied to even carry the iPhone while T-Mobile and Sprint needed to be convinced it would sell. It was more carrier shortsighted-ness than Apple stupidity. posted on 21 Aug 2016, 18:44 0 in response to #110 in response to #110 Hide Reply 112.

If Android and iOS were released at the same time and priced identically, I'm confident in assuming Android would have still dominated the market due to hardware features, OEM options and the ability to customize your experience...most people prefer to stand out from one other and convey their own unique tastes. posted on 22 Aug 2016, 04:13 0 in response to #118 in response to #118 Hide Reply 123. kiko007 (Posts: 2987; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) I don't know about that man....Android used to be pretty iffy most of the time.

The fighting gave me the devices i wanted for whatnot was willing ro pay. Why get mad? It's stupid. You cant win all the time. You have to be willing to lose. After all.no matter How much money Apple makes, they still lose. Apple wont share iOS, becaise unless they lutbrestrictions on the OEM's, Apple wouldn't sell a phone. After all, if you coild get an S7 Edge as is running iOS, wouldnt you take it kver thr lresent iPhone? So wbu not get it with an eve. Etter OS. I do agree with many Java ruins Android. But as low as Java is comoated to Objective C, it's doing better buy being more flexible. Every OEM can't make an OS.

Because it's easier (*cheaper) to simply take a handout on the part of Google than to actually do any REAL work coding an OS. Hell, Google didn't even do that much to Android before shipping it to the masses. They just bought it.....threw a ribbon on a turd (it's a lot better now than it used to be.....trust me) and called it an operating system. That right there is the only reason that Android has such a huge amount of vendors. Remember kids, if you can't make something..... take a handout.

Elaborate..... because nothing I said was false by any stretch of the imagination. Google (who licenses Android for free) gave it to OEMs with the intention if creating mini-ecosystems while maintaing a much larger one. OEMs, took the opportunity to combat Apple with similar offerings, but different software features to compensate for lackluster performance. It is a symbiotic relationship for the most part. The only OEM with the gumption to create it's own OS is Samsung, and Tizen isn't doing too hot these days. The rest are nothing more than forks, offering different UI components while maintaining Google's portfolio. posted on 21 Aug 2016, 12:26 5 in response to #75 in response to #75 Hide Reply 92. tedkord (Posts: 12120; Member since: 17 Jun 2009) Mainly the part about Google not doing much to Android before shipping it, "putting a ribbon on a turd."

Don't get distracted by Alphabet's Other Bets segment. It still derives 99% of its sales from advertising, and that's by no means a bad thing. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 20, 2016 at 7:06PM In case you hadn't realized, life isn't bad for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOG) shareholders. In the roughly 12 months since its surprise corporate reorganization, Alphabet shares have handily outperformed its benchmark index, the tech-weighted Nasdaq Composite. GOOG data by YCharts. Moreover, Alphabet and/or Google shares have utterly trounced the market since their 2004 IPO, gaining roughly 1,330% compared to about a 200% gain from the Nasdaq. So how does Alphabet do it? What's the secret sauce behind its astounding financial success? As it turns out, the answer is fairly straightforward. Advertisements: Alphabet's financial fuel For those with only a passing familiarity, Alphabet's financial performance relies almost entirely on advertising, which comes exclusively from its Google operating subsidiary. As you can see below, advertising accounted for over 99% of Alphabet's revenue in 2015. Here's the company's revenue composition over the past three years.   2013 2014 2015 Other Bets segment  $12  $327  $448 Google segment  $55,507  $65,674  $74,541 Alphabet total revenue  $55,519  $66,001  $74,989 Google as a percentage of Alphabet revenue 100% 99.5% 99.4% Source: Alphabet Investor Relations. This might come as something of a surprise to the casual observer, particularly given the outsized attention that Alphabet receives for its splashy, but currently uneconomical, Other Bets segment. With regards to its forward-looking ambitions, Alphabet has become an incredibly diverse company. In addition to its profit center, Google search business, Alphabet also controls the world's most popular operating system Android, online video juggernaut YouTube, ultra-fast internet service Google Fiber, smart home-appliance maker Nest, an autonomous driving-car project, and a litany of additional projects. At least in part due to the media's proclivity toward the new and exciting, Alphabet's futuristic projects garner far more attention than they contribute financially to the company, though many of its projects admittedly carry ample long-term financial potential. However, in the here and now, Alphabet funds itself and its bold bets on the future of technology through plain old advertising, which, as it turns out, still offers investors plenty of future upside. More room to run Alphabet has a market capitalization exceeding a half-trillion dollars, so it may be fair to wonder how much farther online advertising alone can propel the company's stock. Fortunately, it appears quite a bit. According to researcher eMarketer, digital market spending in the U.S. alone is expected to increase from roughly $69 billion this year to over $105 billion by 2020. Image Source: Alphabet. In another sign of its increasing dominance, digital advertising will overtake TV advertising, long the gold standard of the marketing world, to become the most utilized advertising channel in the U.S. as soon as next year. With Alphabet holding over 50% market share in this space, expect the company to continue to benefit from this long-term secular growth story. As a result of its position at the epicenter of the digital-marketing industry, Alphabet appears well positioned as one of the first tech companies to eclipse a $1 trillion valuation. At the same time, though, it bears noting that the company's size likely means that Alphabet isn't necessarily the growth stock it once was. As we've seen with other mega-cap tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Berkshire Hathaway, size can be its own impediment for driving future returns, though these companies' business models crucially differ from Alphabet's, and Alphabet has certainly been proactive in investing for future growth. Much as it is today, Alphabet figures to remain dependent on advertising well into at least the medium term. However, as discussed above, that should prove more a benefit than a detriment to the company as its overall market continues to expand for years to come.

Hold On... We May Actually Be In For A THIRD Oracle/Google API Copyright Trial from the you-wouldn't-reimplement-an-api dept Yikes. A month ago, we wrote about how Oracle was asking Judge Alsup to agree to another new trial in the Oracle v. Google API copyright case. I joked that they basically had no chance, and Judge Alsup had already rejected their attempts to overturn the jury ruling. But... I may have spoken too soon. In a hearing on the matter earlier this week, Oracle insisted that there needed to be a new trial because Google had withheld information on plans to offer Android on Chromebooks -- something that Google announced at this year's Google IO which happened (awkward!) while the trial was going on. And this morning, Alsup issued an order telling both sides to provide sworn statements about this. For Google, it's why it had not updated its discovery responses to include the plans for Android on Chromebooks, and for Oracle, whether it, too, had neglected to update its discovery responses (and specifically calls out a misrepresentation by Oracle): By THURSDAY AUGUST 25, AT NOON, Christa Anderson, counsel for Google, shall submit a sworn statement explaining why the discovery responses referenced in Court yesterday were not updated, including the full extent to which counsel knew Google’s intention to launch a full version of Marshmallow, including the Google Play Store, for Chrome OS. By the same date and time, Annette Hurst, counsel for Oracle, shall submit a sworn statement setting forth, after full inquiry, the full extent to which Oracle neglected to update its discovery responses by reason, in whole or in part, of one or more rulings by the judge. The same statement shall explain why counsel repeatedly represented that the Jones v. Aero/chem decision required an “evidentiary hearing” when that decision, as it turns out, made no mention of an “evidentiary hearing” and instead remanded because no “hearing” or other consideration at all had been given to the issue of discovery conduct by the district judge. This does not mean that there absolutely will be a third trial, but it's at least more of a possibility than most observers thought possible. I honestly don't see how Android on Chromebook really matters for the fair use analysis. Oracle argues that since most of the talk on the market impact was limited to phones and tablets, that may have impacted the jury, but that's kind of laughable. The reality is that Oracle just wants another crack at a decision it disagrees with. Of course, all of this is really a stupid side show. The real underlying problem was the Federal Circuit's decision that APIs were covered by copyright, despite almost no one actually thinking that's true. The whole fair use trial was an awkward mess, mainly because all of the arguments weren't so much about "fair use" but about whether or not anyone actually considered APIs to be covered by copyright. Going through another such trial would just be a mess. But the other area where a new case may come about is that Judge Alsup made clear that Oracle was also free to bring new cases on new uses of Android to see if they were also fair use, meaning that any time Google does anything new with Android, it may face a new fair use trial. They wouldn't need to do this if the CAFC had just recognized that APIs are not covered by copyright, but it didn't and here we are in a big heaping mess. By the same date, counsel shall meet and confer and advise the Court whether the form of judgment should be amended to reflect that it is not a final judgment but a Rule 52(c) judgment on partial findings, given that Oracle is entitled to challenge further uses of Android herein. This case is never going to end. 96c272c9-87d2-489d-8678-89f21c7bb1f3 (PDF) 96c272c9-87d2-489d-8678-89f21c7bb1f3 (Text) 29 Comments | Leave a Comment Hide Techdirt ads If you liked this post, you may also be interested in...

Oracle claims $7B of revenue there, and Google $12B. Shouldn't this battle be fought where they pay taxes?

[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ] royleith (profile), Aug 20th, 2016 @ 1:46am Oracle Gave Google A License for Java SE The point of this case is that Java SE is licensed for 'General Purpose Desktop Computers', but not for mobile phones. Sun wanted Java to be implemented on as many general purpose computer platforms as possible and roped in many organisations, including Apache, to make this happen. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html (Note: the original Sun licence in force during Google's development of Android did not refer to tablets and was much more loosely phrased. Oracle 'tightened it up' after the start of the case. Google never used Sun's binary code, but used the Sun licensed Apache code. The Sun license must apply to the API as well as any Sun binary code otherwise the licence is useless for Sun's desktop plans.) Oracle were incensed that their plans for a money-making, Java-based, mobile phone OS were stymied by Android. That is why there was all the discussion about mobile phones and tablets in the case because that's the basis of the complaint. Google Chrome is a general purpose computer. It has a full Java SE licence. It can also use the open source Java JDK licensed by Sun. If Oracle are going to sue every Unix/Linux based general purpose computer OS that implements or uses Java SE, then that is the end of Java.

This reeks of Oracle trying to recover a bad investment by trying to shakedown a rich competitor.

If you have any SFWO (Sad Friends With Oracle) you will without a doubt be able to listen to horror stories about Oracle's licensing police and their friendly audits that cost their customers millions. They have been know to watch for announcements of IT improvement projects that increase the number of cores and virtual systems which all need a separate license for their products. Even better, IMO, are the ones regarding trying to get out of a contract with Oracle. Those efforts are much like this trail.

Define your site main menu javascript:void(0) The javascript:void(0) error is fairly unique, in that it  is one of the few computer-based errors that can be encountered by users of any operating system. The error is thrown on web browsers with the end-user surfs to websites that are not fully compatible with the version of Internet browser being used or have a javascript-related error. If you encounter the error while surfing to various Internet web pages, there are a number of common fixes that can be applied in order to solve the issue. What is Javascript? Javascript is an interpreted programming language that has been embedded in web browsers for a number of years. It is formally defined in the ECMAScript language standard and primarily is deployed in web browsers.  The language allows client-side scripts to be embedded within webpages to help the end-user interact with websites, control the browser, dynamically alter content, and is very common in game and desktop application development. The language is type-safe, dynamic is was significantly influenced by the C programming language. There are a number of naming conventions copied from the Java programming language; however, that is where the similarity with Java stops. Modern Javascript is based on the Scheme and Self programming languages and support object orientated, functional, and imperative programming styles in implementation. Use of the language has grown to include desktop widgets, PDF documents, and site-specific browsers today. There have also been a number of Javascript frameworks released which feature faster performance that have aided in the popularity of the script on the server-side for Internet applications. Due to the increased popularity of the language, the number of locations that an end-user can run into the javascript:void(0) error has significantly increased over the past decade. Common Causes of the Javascript:void(0) Error The common causes of the  javascript:void(0) error include anti-popup software, Internet proxies, javascript being disabled, and a web browser upgrade being required. Conflicts with Anti-Popup Software Although commonly embedded within web browsers and other computer security software today, there are still a number of consumers who download and use anti-popup software. These applications are created in order to eliminate the pop-up windows that launch on visiting some websites. Although pop-up blockers prove beneficial to many end-users, they can cause issues on websites one is trying to view. This results from many of the pop-up blocking technologies  on the market achieving their desired effect by shutting down the Javascript embedded on the targeted webpage. A secondary effect to blocking the pop-up is that the javascript:void(0) error can be thrown if the desired webpage relies on Javascript to work properly. A short-term solution is to turn off your pop-up blocking program. Then, if you want to keep using the application you need to validate the configuration settings for the application. Many of the popular pop-up blocking programs will provide options that allow Javascript to run on the targeted website so you don’t remove all functionality while also avoiding the javascript:void(0) error. Badly Written Javascript Another common cause of the javascript:void(0) error message is incompatible Javascript. This error is more common in legacy code than in that produced today; however, it typically arises from web page authors who do not check their script for compatibility with the various web browsers on the market. If this is the case for the error received on a page surfed to, then an end-user has two options: 1 – Try another web browser when viewing the page, or 2 – Ask the web page author to fix the issue. Unfortunately many page authors will be slow to respond…if they do at all. As a result, the most-proven solution in this case is to use the web browser that the page is designed to support if you are able to install it on your computer. Problems with Internet Proxies Internet proxy servers function as an intermediary between end-users and websites. Since they help create a layer of anonymity between end-users and website, they are highly popular. Unfortunately, they can also interfere with the loading of Javascript on websites an end-user is surfing. Of course, the easiest way to avoid the issue is to just not use a proxy. For many individuals; however, this is either 1 – not possible, or 2 – not preferred. As a result, if you are getting the Javascript:void(0) error while using a proxy, one should locate a different proxy server and attempt the same task. If the error persists, then attempt to find a proxy server which uses a different script than the one you are trying to use. Javascript is Disabled in your Web Browser One of the predominant causes of the javascript:void(0) error is Javascript being disabled in the web browser. This cause is common across web browsers and operating systems. The primary fix is to turn-on Javascript or “enable” it in the web browser. On some computers, you may have to restart the browser or the computer for the change to take effect. The Web Browser Requires Upgrade Many savvy computer users live in fear of upgrading Internet Explorer or other web  browsers due to the software’s past history with not providing “graceful” upgrades to the software.  Besides helping ensure your computer is protected against the latest online security threats, ensuring one’s web browser is upgraded will help minimize the frequency the javascript:void(0) error is encountered. How to Upgrade an Internet Browser Upgrading Internet Explorer Many end-users will not necessarily know if their computer has the most current version of Internet Explorer installed or not. Depending on the frequency that Windows Updates is configured to run on the machine, the web browser may not be the most current version or build available. Step 1 – Ensure you are logged in to your computer with an account that has administrator permissions. Step 2 – Open Internet Explorer by double clicking the program icon located on your computer’s desktop. Step 3 – Select the “Help” menu tab located in the task bar located in the upper, left-hand corner of Internet Explorer. Step 4 – Select the “About Internet Explorer” menu option to display the version and build of the web browser installed on the computer. Note the information that is displayed. Step 5 – Visit the Internet Explorer download page provided by Microsoft. If the version listed on the web page is newer than installed on your computer, click the “Get Internet Explorer XX” link. *Note: XX will be a specific version number of the web browser. Step 6 – De-select the “make Bing and MSN defaults” check box before downloading the upgraded version of Internet Explorer if you do not want to change your computer’s default search engine. Step 7 – Double-click the Internet Explorer installation file once the download completes. If you do not want to make IE the default web browser on your computer, de-select the appropriate menu options when stepping through the installation wizard. Step 8 – Restart your computer after the installation process concludes to complete the upgrade of IE on your computer. How to Install Google Chrome? In the event that Internet Explorer is not fully supporting the website that is throwing the Javascript:void(0) error, Google Chrome is a popular alternative to use in IE’s place. The browser supports several operating systems to include Microsoft Windows, Linux, and OS X. Install Chrome on Microsoft Windows Step 1 – Download the Google Chrome installation file to your computer. If prompted, select the “Save” or the “Run” menu option. Step 2 – If the installation file was saved onto your computer, double-click the file after the download is completed. Chrome will automatically import the browsing history and settings from the computer’s default web browser. Step 3 – If your computer is running Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7, a browser (Chrome) window will launch once setup is complete. On the first launch of the web browser, there will be an option displayed to change the computer’s default search engine if desired. Step 4 – On computers that have Windows 8 installed, there will be a welcome dialogue that is displayed. Choose the “Next” menu button to select the default browser for your computer. If Chrome is selected, it will then display as a Windows 8 app on the computer’s “Start” screen. Install Google Chrome on Linux Google Chrome supports installation on most Linux builds. The recommended method to install the browser is to install Chrome via the native package management system. It can also be copied to a local user directory and executed without administrator permissions. Step 1 – Download the Google Chrome installer file to the computer. Step 2 – Select the “Ok” menu button to open the installation package. Step 3 – Choose the “Install Package” menu option to start installing the program. Step 4 – Google Chrome will launch once the program is setup. The first launch of the program will display information to let the default search engine for the computer to be changed if desired. It will also enable Google search directly from the address bar of the browser. Step 5 – To subsequently open the web browser, choose the “Applications,” “Internet,” and “Google Chrome” menu options. These steps will add the Chrome repository to the Linux package manager to enable updates to the browser. Install Google Chrome on Mac OS X Step 1 – Download the Google Chrome installation file for Mac OS X. Step 2 – Open or launch the file labeled, “Chrome.dmg” after the download is complete. Step 3 – In the subsequently displayed dialogue window, drag the Chrome icon to the Mac OS X “Applications” folder. This action will install Google Chrome for all user accounts on the computer. The browser history and home page settings will be automatically imported from the default we browser on the computer. Step 4 – Launch the Chrome web browser after installation concludes.

You can make simulated popups using a combo of css, html, and javascript. For example, WebRocketX is a good example of a framework that relies heavily on this technique. However, it’s not that hard to roll your own solution. You can even make popups upon popups indefinitely like this.

The feature is in the developer stage, but here's how you can put it into action.  ( François Beaufort | Google+ ) Advertisement Wouldn't things be a lot simpler if we did not have to recollect complicated alphanumeric passwords and could simply unlock our device's screen by merely keying in a few random numbers instead? Google hears you! That's right, the company is working on an experimental feature that allows you to unlock your device's screen by simply inputting a PIN code like you do with your debit or credit card. This PIN must simply be keyed in to the Chrome OS, negating the need for one to type complex passwords. This is no rumor and the news comes straight from the horse's mouth: a Google employee who shared the exciting information in a Google+ post. On Friday, Aug. 19, François Beaufort, who is with Google France, revealed that the experimental feature is being tested as part of the latest developer update for Chrome OS. Beaufort also shared the process on how users could deploy the functionality into their system. For those wondering how to go about unlocking their device's screen with a PIN on Chrome OS, here's a step-by-step guide to help you out. Step 1: Enable the following flag: chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin Step 2: Next, restart Chrome. Step 3: Once started, navigate to the settings page for Chrome Material Design. This is required so that you can set up the PIN for the Lock Screen. Step 4: Navigate to the new "Screen Lock" section. Set up the numeric PIN you have chosen for the Lock Screen. Step 5: Make a mental note of your PIN and then press Search button + L simultaneously to lock the screen. Step 6: Key in the PIN, and watch yourself unlock the Chrome OS with a code rather than a password! The experimental functionality is bound to find favor with users of touch devices as it is quite handy. Moreover, inputting a PIN instead of an alphanumeric password is a lot simpler. This is possibly far more secure than deploying an Android phone for the Smart Lock option as Engadget points out. The move is being lauded by Chrome OS fans, but as a user rightly pointed out the PIN functionality could be more expansive. "This is a good move in the right direction. However I think that this pin lock feature should be expanded to also include passwords. So the password is not linked to the Google account but a separate password just for the device," commented the user. Since the feature is still being tested, perhaps Google will enhance it further before the final version is pushed out. Users can also look forward to Quick Unlock settings landing on the regular settings page for Chrome in the near future as revealed by Beaufort. Those keen on more can check the source code out at this link. TAG Chrome OS, PIN code, Passwords © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Brad Ideas Crazy ideas, inventions and essays from Brad Templeton. Computers, Robocars, Civil Rights, Photography and more. Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40.

Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker? I heard it here (webinar on high definition maps) http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation/automot... » reply Taxi model Submitted by Bejoy (not verified) on Mon, 2016-09-12 02:45. Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

In an early look at the beta version of Google Allo by Android Police, there are quite some good revelations coming out. While it has been discovered that Allo will come with the ability to delete individual messages from a conversation, unlike Hangouts which only allows deleting the entire conversation, there are also an interesting collection of stickers. The use of animated characters has grown along with the growth of messaging apps. Many IMs today come with a collection of inbuilt stickers and apparently, Google Allo has its own packs that look extremely weird, but you’ll definitely enjoy using them. Have you ever thought of sending your pal a sticker of a bull squeezing his nipples or even a condom? Well, this is your day as the upcoming Google Allo has about everything you can ever want. You will come across the likes of Cool Beans and Julio the Bull, just to name but a few stickers, all of which can be used to spice up conversations. These are nothing close to the list of emojis found in Google Hangouts. Since Google Allo is still in the testing stages, these sticker packs are only available on the unfinished version. With this in mind, changes can take place before the official version is released. But it would be unique to have such kind of weird stickers on Allo. It is also possible that some of these stickers may be dropped along the way. Google will be hoping that Allo takes off at least in the same manner as Google Duo did when it was released a few days ago. Apparently, the app is already ahead of Pokémon Go when it comes to the number of downloads in the Google Play Store and it is only bettered by the veteran Facebook Messenger, which is also its closest rival in the video calling business.

Google Allo might feature some ‘controversial’ stickers! TECHNOLOGY 0 0 268 Google announced two new products in May– allo and Duo. The search engine giant expounded that Google allo would be an aI-supported mobile messaging platform while Duo would focus on video calling. at that time, many people thought Google had decided to kill its all-in-one communication app-Hangouts. Just a few days ago, Google released its video calling app Duo which already became the number 1 free app in the Play Store. However, during this year’s Google I/O, the company also announced a new messaging application, allo. allo is expected to be released soon, as information on the app continues to surface online. The latest shows that the application will be coming with a feature that allows users to delete messages from their chat history. Users will be able to select the message and simply delete it from the chat. Google launched their much awaited video calling app, the Google Duo last week. The app had been anticipated for a long while, and was indeed worth the wait. While Google made video calling as simple as it could get with Duo, the markets now await allo. Google had announced two apps back during the Google I/O 2016 – allo and Duo. Just one day before Duo came out, the company had changed the icons of both the apps. Google allo too, is soon expected to release. Recent screenshots leaked via android Police add to the intrigue of this app. These leaked screenshots indicate that Google allo might feature some ‘controversial’ stickers. The screenshots feature images of stickers, which are sexually suggestive in nature. Google’s latest app will come with three pre-installed sticker packs and more can be installed later. Based on the information obtained from the reports, there are 24 sticker packs available. There are a number of controversial stickers in Google allo such as one with the text ‘Send Pics’. This one, when looked closely gives a vibe that the sender is asking for nude pictures. another picture showcases ‘rubber up’, its not hard to guess what its indicating. While these newly introduced stickers on Google allo are indeed funny to some extent, the fact is they are for a slightly more mature audience. However there is a chance Google may pull them down before the app finally releases in the Play Store.

Google is aiming at a direct war with WhatsApp with the arrival of this app. The company announced Allo and Duo messengers during the Google I/O 2016 event. Back then, it was announced that these apps will ‘soon’ release. However, now that Duo is out, Google has really impressed us with their simplicity. The company is soon expected to release their next app, Allo. Based on information obtained via Android Police, it has come to light, that users can delete messages from their chat in Allo. While this seems like a very basic feature which most messengers allow the users to do. The fact is, that Google did not allow this in the past. Be it Google Hangouts or the much beloved Google Talk. The users had no options on deleting an individual message from their conversation. The users did have an option of deleting the entire conversation, but not a single message. This was a something which bothered a number of users. In the present scenario it is considered a very basic feature and many messengers including WhatsApp support it. However, one must keep in mind, that the deleted messages are deleted only from the sender’s device. They still exist on the the receiver’s device. Some apps like Telegram and even Instagram do offer this ability though. As of now there is no option to select multiple messages and delete them together, but it is likely to appear in the final build. Users are also prompted with messages of deleting media from just the chat or entirely from the phone. In addition to this, Google Allo has also been in the news over some of their ‘controversial’ stickers which are sexually suggestive in nature. There is no release date that has been speculated, but it is expected in the coming few weeks.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Google Has Planned To End Support For Chrome Apps On Mac, Windows And Linux By Ali Salman Posted Aug 20, 2016 70Shares Share Tweet Submit Google’s hosted chrome applications run on Google’s browsers through a single manifested file and are generally limited by webpage security restrictions. However, the company’s packaged applications are those which offer similar functionality and have been designed to work on desktops. The latter has the ability to interact with local storage of the machine. Today, Google has announced that it will kill Chrome apps for Macs, Windows and Linux in 2018. Chrome Apps Support To Be Ended On Mac, Windows And Linux Starting Later This Year Google to phase out Chrome apps on desktops means that users will no longer be able to run Chrome apps on any platform except for Chrome OS. Google’s plans start later this year as Chrome apps will only be available to Chrome OS users. Current installed apps will not be affected by this and can still be updated. Moving forward at sometime in the year 2017, the Chrome Web Store will no longer display Chrome apps at any of the above mentioned operating systems. Finally, in 2018, you will not be able to load any of them on Macs, Windows and Linux. As astounding as the deal sounds, the company states that not a huge portion of people are actively using Chrome apps. So generally speaking, not many people will be affected by the change. If you’re worried about Chrome extensions and themes, stay put because they would not be affected. For a while there were certain experiences the web couldn’t provide, such as working offline, sending notifications, and connecting to hardware. We launched Chrome apps three years ago to bridge this gap. Since then, we’ve worked with the web standards community to enable an increasing number of these use cases on the web. Developers can use powerful new APIs such as service worker and web push to build robust Progressive Web Apps that work across multiple browsers Advertisement Nonetheless, one might always question what Google is up to and what future plans does it have for Chrome OS. The company’s justifications leads it to make a real place and need for Chrome apps rather than making them available to the open web. Making Chrome apps available on the web has its own set of limitations like connecting a hardware device or working offline. Google has most certainly patched some of the loopholes and more improvements are on the way. OpenCAPI Brings Together IBM, AMD, Google and Several More for Heterogenous Computing It definitely makes sense for Google to make its apps recognized as a separate entity rather than being in an always-available scenario. This is it for now, folks. Do you think Google is heading towards the right direction by ending its Chrome apps support for Macs, Windows and Linux? Share your thoughts with us in the comments.

Not only is it a departure from what Google has long been invested in doing with Hangouts, but it’s also trying to catch up in one swift release with competing messaging apps that have been around the block for many years and have had time to perfect their approach. So it seems logical that the Allo team got some “inspiration” from other messaging services.

No? Apparently not that many people are, which is why Google will be killing them off for both Mac and Windows in the next few years. Chrome apps are basically apps that run within Google’s Chrome web browser, and some look and act like stand-alone apps. There are a number of apps available, including the likes of Hangouts, Google Keep, an so on. Chrome needs to be running and open in order for these apps to work, even if they seem like standard apps. Related: Google Chrome’s “VR Shell” would let you view any website in virtual reality Google’s decision comes as part of an effort to make Chrome a little simpler. For example, Google removed the app launcher, which allowed users to access Chrome apps, from Chrome in the past few months. Before that, in December 2015, Google removed the notification center from Chrome. Of course, this decision doesn’t mean that Google will get rid of apps on Chrome OS — those will stick around, at least for now. The apps won’t disappear immediately. Google has a plan to get rid of the apps over the next two years. Here’s the timeline for Google Chrome apps: End of 2016: Apps that are newly published won’t be available to Chrome users on Windows, Mac, or Linux. Those apps will only appear for Chrome OS users. Late 2017: Chrome Web Store won’t show Chrome apps for Windows, Mac, or Linux. Early 2018: Chrome apps will stop working on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Google will also give the Chrome Web Store a makeover to emphasis themes and extensions instead of Chrome apps. There are a few reasons the move makes sense. Not only did few people use Chrome apps, but web apps themselves have been getting more popular, too, essentially eliminating the need for apps that run within the Chrome web browser. That’s partly why the process is taking so long — according to a report from VentureBeat, Google wants to ensure that much of the functionality found in Chrome apps is available through web apps first.

Google has announced that it’s phasing out support for Chrome apps on Windows, macOS and Linux. According to a blog post by Google, “approximately 1 percent of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps, and most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps.” The company believes the low number of active Chrome app users is too low to warrant keeping them in action. While both packaged and hosted apps will continue to recieve support and updates on the Chrome OS platform, they will be steadily removed from other platforms over the next two years. “Starting in late 2016, newly-published Chrome apps will only be available to users on Chrome OS. Existing Chrome apps will remain accessible on all platforms, and developers can continue to update them.” In the second half of 2017, the Chrome Web Store will no longer have apps available for Windows Mac and Linux, though it will continue to show extensions and themes. By 2018, Chrome apps on those platforms will stop working completely.

As we have the last couple of months now, today we’ll be showing you another 5 Android apps that you should definitely give a shot… Google Duo After its announcement at Google I/O, Google finally released Duo this month. Duo is a 1-on-1 video chat app with a single focus: simplicity. Duo accomplishes that goal by stripping away a lot of the things most video calling apps have but don’t necessarily need. This all starts with the setup. Rather than using a Google account, Duo uses your phone number to sign in and organizes contacts based on their phone numbers. Duo is a one-to-one video calling app for everyone – designed to be simple, reliable and fun so you never miss a moment. Once you’ve set up, Duo launches with the front facing camera turned on, a quick option to start a new call or call a recent contact. From opening the app to getting in a call, you might make 3-5 taps in total, and that’s awesome. Another area where Duo shines is in reliability. Not only does the app adapt to your network speeds, but it will do just about anything to keep a call going. Whether you switch from Wi-Fi to data, or if you’re just in an area with really bad coverage, Duo is going to do everything it can to keep the call connected. Duo also features “Knock Knock” which allows you to easily see who is calling with a live feed of the caller before the call even begins. It only works for those in your address book and can be turned off, but it really does make Duo stand out a bit from the crowd of other services out there today. The app is still in its infancy, so much-needed features such as multi-device support, group calls, and even audio calls aren’t here just yet, although some of those are on the way. Duo is completely free to use and works cross-platform on both Android and iOS. Prisma One of the primary uses we have for our smartphones is photography. With new flagships and even budget devices now packing amazing camera sensors, the quality of the quick snaps we take just keeps getting better. There have been dozens of apps over the years to edit and improve the shots taken with our phones, but one of the more interesting options lately is Prisma. After making its debut on iOS last month, Prisma later made its way to Android with the same core focus: turning average pictures into art. As I mentioned, apps have done this before, so what sets Prisma apart? Rather than relying on your smartphone, Prisma actually uses cloud-computing to analyze your photo, identify objects within it, and then recreate that photo with one of several different “filters” that are available. Prisma transforms your photos into artworks using the styles of famous artists: Munk, Picasso as well as world famous ornaments and patterns. A unique combination of neural networks and artificial intelligence helps you turn memorable moments into timeless art. Depending on the photo you use, Prisma can create some truly stunning shots. If you enjoy smartphone photography, it’s an app I’d definitely recommend checking out. You can pick it up over on Google Play for free.  Weather Mate Another great app we’re featuring this month is Weather Mate. This detailed weather app gives users quick and easy access to just about every detail of the day’s forecast that they may want to know. You can easily see the current weather conditions for your area with added details such as humidity, wind speeds, and the barometric pressure at a glance. Scrolling down you’ll find both extended and hourly forecasts and even more weather details toward the bottom. The app has a very clean and easy interface based on Xiaomi’s Android UI, and I have to say that I quite like it. One of my favorite aspects of this app is its homescreen widget. Where most detailed weather widgets look very cluttered and, well, ugly, this one does not. The transparent background goes well with most wallpapers and it provides a ton of information at a glance. I’d almost say that Weather Mate is worth downloading solely for this widget, but either way it’s completely free on Google Play with no in-app purchases. Iconstructor One of the best aspects of Android is customization. In this very series we’ve highlighted a handful of great customization apps, but Iconstructor takes things to a new level. This app allows anyone who has a bit of patience to create their own custom icon packs in just a matter of minutes. These icons pack are of course based on a set of templates, but using the various options in the app you can make some great looking icons pretty easily. You can even incorporate icon packs that you’ve previously purchased to enhance your design. One word of caution though, don’t use this app to rip off hard working icon pack designers — just have some fun for yourself. Make your own icons! Export individual icons or generate icon packs to be automatically applied to your launcher of choice. Control the color, shape, shadows, icon pack and more of the icons! Add multiple layers to make more complex styles or add an outline for a simple, minimal icon pack. Iconstructor is available for free on Google Play, however to get the full experience you’ll want to pick up the $2.49 pro version. InsWall Keeping with the theme of customization, let’s finish off the month with a wallpaper app. InsWall is free app full of great, photography-based wallpapers. As a fan of these kinds of wallpapers on my setup, I really enjoyed looking through the various options found within InsWall. Along with all the awesome wallpapers, InsWall also features a clean, Material Design inspired UI and no in-app purchases. You can of course support the developers if you choose to do so, but it isn’t a requirement to get everything out of the app. Experience the world of customization with over 175 beautiful wallpapers. Make your creativity fly and enjoy the broad content of InsWall. InsWall is available now on Google Play for free. If you’re not a fan of these photography style wallpapers, I’d also recommend checking out Backdrops, also free on Google Play. Have suggestions for what apps we should feature next month?

Google Capital is a separate entity from Google Fiber, and it specializes in later-stage investments. This deal appears to be more about combining two regional overbuilders into a top 10 US cable company that should put the heat on incumbent MSOs. And it’s also further evidence of private equity’s interest in smaller operators. Private equity firm TPG will pay Abry Partners $2.25bln—$1.6bln for RCN and $650mln for Grande—and combine the providers. However, both will continue to operate under their respective names, which already have established clout in the marketplace. There also won’t be a big change in management, with TPG partnering with Patriot Media, which currently manages both RCN and Grande. Patriot is headed by Steve Simmons and Jim Holanda. Abry bought Grande in 2009 when it also owned Atlantic Broadband, whose existing management team added management of Grande. When Abry bought RCN a year later for $1.2bln, Patriot was brought in to manage the overbuilder. Atlantic Broadband was sold to Cogeco in 2012, opening the door for Patriot to take over management of Grande in 2013. While Abry could have combined the two like TPG is doing, given the different geographies (RCN has subs in NY, DC and Boston, while Grande’s customer base is in TX) and uncertainty in the M&A space, it probably made sense to keep them separate to preserve their options. The deal is expected to close in 1Q17. It would be wise to pay close attention to TPG’s statement on the purchase, which focuses on HSD. “The way that content is distributed and consumed has evolved significantly in ways that create an overwhelming demand for affordable, high-speed cable networks. There is an unprecedented amount of diverse, creative content being produced that is extremely bandwidth intensive,” David Trujillo, partner at TPG, said in a statement. “High-speed data has become, and will remain, the essential connection for both consumers and businesses. Both RCN and Grande are proven leaders in providing fast, affordable, and reliable data services.” Grande is at the top of Netflix’s ISP speed index for July, with RCN also ranking above several large incumbents. And just last week, RCN was named PC Magazine’s Readers’ Choice for best ISP for the 2nd year in a row. The added financial support of TPG given the overbuilders’ offerings could help to accelerate OTT launches by incumbents. RCN offers both Hulu and Netflix content as a channel through its DVR powered by TiVo. TPG was advised on the transaction by PJT Partners, UBS, Cleary Gottlieb, and Deloitte.

Skip to content Search for: Search Kopitiam Bot News · Lifestyle · Tech · Singapore Home Current Affairs Technology Startups Money Matters Lifestyle Contact Us About Technology Doodle Fruit Games Are Less Scandalous Than Rio’s Olympics. Maybe. Date: 2016-08-21Author: kopitiambot (Source: kotaku.com) Not pictured: Me One of the biggest scandals to hit the 2016 Google Doodle Fruit Games was the realization that I can’t ride a tricycle. But it’s far from the only one. My career as a Fruitlympian is over. The 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio are coming to a close, after two weeks of the world’s best athletes showing the rest of us that we’re plebs, as well as delicious scandals. And during that time, the Google Doodle folks hosted their latest time wasters: The 2016 Doodle Fruit Games—simple mobile app games, which have shown me that my reaction times are that of a pleb, as well as giving a peek into a weird fruit dystopia. Or something… My account of the seven available events are as follows: Event 1: The Strawberry Sprint Game Was A Death Trap Disguised As Fun In this event, Google overestimated my left and right screen tapping abilities. Scattered on the ground were speed up pads—I was supposed to touch those, I think. Google also thought I needed a little incentive by allowing a watermelon into the competition. One of the other fruits got squashed by it because I cut him off. Harsh. That was my first clue that the Fruit Games were not all they seemed. I ran the races at least two more times, and every time I finished in second place. At least I never got squashed by that terror, the Watermelon. Hunger Game Fans, I have a question: what usually happens to runner-ups? Best Score: 25.6 secs Event 2: Pineapple Tennis Ended In Tears And Straight Up Murder Now here is a game I was actually decent at. Timed taps volleyed the tennis ball back and forth between my opponents and me. I slaughtered them—and then stood on the bodies of my competitors. Oh. Well, that smarmy Dragon Fruit deserved it, anyway. No regrets. Best score: 33 Event 3: Grape Hurdles Sent Me To The Hospital I didn’t like this one. Not. one. bit. Hurdle jumping isn’t as easy as touching the screen and swiping your finger! Oh…well, according to this Google game, it is. I got two stars out of three, and many buzzer sounds every time I barreled through the hurdles. Whatever. Best score: 28 Event 4: Lemon Pool Shenanigans Questioned Everything In The World There was something very wrong with this “pool”. Ice cubes, rubber duckies, and crossbones obstacles were all up in the water. Tilting the phone to avoid them wasn’t so bad. Hitting the ice was a terrible ordeal, but I suppose the pool situation could have been worse. Best score: 67m Event 5: Blueberry Golf Wasn’t At All Like Golf (Not That I Would Actually Know) This event required skillfully tilting the phone to quickly move the blueberry “golf ball” into three sections of a golf course. It’s a bit like those wooden puzzle games where you tilt it to move the tiny silver balls into holes. I was not so skillful. Perhaps more disturbing is that the golfer is an orange. That blueberry needs to stand up for itself. Best score: 65s Event 6: All The Years of Going Apple Picking and Kicking Them, Finally Paid Off This was another event of fruit on fruit violence, as it’s your job as an apple to toss grapes repeatedly into a net. It’s so fun though, that who cares really? Aiming and flicking fingers across the touchscreen is how this event is played, and I did wonderfully. At least I felt I did. A winner is me. Best score: 21 Event 7: Coconut BMX Can Crawl Into A Hole And Die Ugh. This game. The one with the tricycle riding coconut. No matter how many tricks I tried to apply, I never got more than one star in this event. Maybe it was the squeaky tricycle chain that distracted me, as a reminder of that time I almost got killed by a dog when I was riding my own tricycle as a child. Yeah. Let’s go with that excuse for my incompetence at pressing the touchscreen and my poorly timed releases. Best score: 1686 And now for a display of my collective shame, for your viewing pleasure: Can’t wait to see how I fail in 2020. All images via screencap.

However, as the open web grew and matured, the need for these apps diminished, and now Google will soon be killing them off entirely.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google has announced that it will gradually phase out support for Chrome web apps on Windows, Mac and Linux - a move that comes as the company struggles to find a new niche after the apps, which offered unique functions that the open web couldn't provide at the time the apps were conceived, have become mainstream. "For a while there were certain experiences the web couldn't provide, such as working offline, sending notifications and connecting to hardware," the company said as part of its justification for the decision. Around 2013, Google introduced Chrome web apps in order to address a lingering problem that Chrome OS was a victim of: a lack of apps. At the time, this was actually the greatest weakness of the Chrome OS. Chromebooks were already rather successful because of their low cost and how easy they were to manage, and they have since gone on to find high adoption rates in corporate and educational settings. Google sought to fix Chrome's final problem by allowing developers to create web apps that functioned similarly to traditional stand-alone apps. The appeal was that these apps would be universal, and did not require any extra effort from developers to make them compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux computers, since users on those platforms could simply access the apps through the Chrome browser. The end result? Users got apps that simulated smaller apps in their own dedicated window, offering a range of apps such as Google Keep, Hangouts and Wunderlist on non-Chrome OS computers. While a solid idea, unfortunately, it didn't entirely pan out. Why? They aren't really needed anymore. In a blog post, Google stated that there are two types of Chrome apps: packaged apps and hosted apps. Currently, roughly 1 percent of users on Windows, Mac and Linux actively use Chrome-packaged apps. Meanwhile, most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps. As a result, the tech company will focus on improving Chrome and gradually phase out the apps on every other system over the next few years, before killing it off entirely. By the end of 2016, any new Chrome apps that are published will only be available to Chrome OS users, though existing apps can continue to be updated. By mid-2017, Windows, Mac and Linux users won't be able to see Chrome apps in the Chrome Web Store. And in early 2018, Chrome apps won't function on those platforms anymore. The company said that Chrome apps will continue to be supported and maintained on Chrome OS "for the foreseeable future," but considering that the Play Store is coming to Chrome OS and Chrome apps are being killed off on every other platform, that future doesn't look like it will be a particularly long one.

Google announced yesterday plans to slowly phase out Chrome apps on all platforms by early 2018. Good news is all the apps will continue to be supported on the company’s own platform, Chrome OS. The move appears to be to force users, who have pledged loyalty to Windows, Mac, or Linux, to join its platform. According to the company’s plans, starting later this year, users on other platforms will not be able to download new Chrome apps. Existing apps, however, will remain available and updated on all platforms, which include Windows, Mac, and Linux. Then, sometime in 2017, the company’s Web Store will stop displaying them on all other platforms. By early 2018, the search engine giant plans to completely kill the support of the apps on other platforms. Chrome apps are web-based applications that run on Google’s main browser. The main purpose for the company offering apps on other platforms was due to certain experiences the web platform could not offer, such as working offline. According to the company, these loopholes have been patched. "Developers who can’t fully move their apps to the web can help us prioritize new APIs to help fill the gaps left by Chrome apps." There are two types of Chrome apps. Hosted apps are installed on the company’s web platform, while Packaged Apps are traditional apps you find on Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store. The phase-out has given developers a year-and-a-half to migrate their apps to Chrome’s platform. Additionally, the company is also providing developers tools to help with the migration. The news of Google killing support of its apps on other platforms isn’t really unexpected. In December 2015, it was reported that the company had removed its notification center from its browser. In July of the same year, the Chrome app launcher was removed from the browsers on all other platforms. It seems the company had initially planned to make apps harder to access and then direct the users toward its own operating system. Several tech experts believe that forcing developers to migrate their apps from top operating systems might cause them to lose interest in creating apps for Chromes OS. Perhaps to counter that, Google recently announced plans to add support of Android apps on Chrome computers.

Thus, by 2018, users of the said platforms will not be able to load any of the Chrome apps that are still available for them to access at present. Silently dropping the bombshell on its Chromium blog on Friday, Google explained that the removal of the Chrome apps will be gradual, such that existing Chrome apps will continue to work on the platforms by the end of this year, while new apps will only be available to Chrome OS users. By 2017, Chrome apps will no longer appear on the Chrome Web Store on the three platforms, and by 2018, users of the three platforms will not be able to load the apps.  Though this may come as a surprise to Mac, Windows and Linux users who utilize Chrome apps, this will not be shocking to many since Google has explained that the reason behind this move is actually the poor reception of the apps among Mac, Windows and Linux users. To be exact, only one percent of users of the three platforms actively use Chrome’s packaged apps or its fully functional applications.  Related Stories Is Google Replacing Chrome OS, Android With Fuchsia? However, Google is not just removing packaged apps. Hosted apps or applications that are accessible through the web are also affected by this move. Because of this, developers can only work on Chrome apps for Chrome OS in the near future. Google even encouraged developers in the blog post to start migrating their Chrome apps to the web.  Scrapping Chrome apps for other platforms is a bit risky, since PC World sees this as a threat that could discourage developers from building apps for the Chrome OS. The only consolation on the developers' part is that Google announced months prior that Android apps will soon be compatible with Chrome OS computers, and this could encourage Chrome apps developers to also try their hand at making Android apps and perhaps focus on this in the near future.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The much-lauded sequel to Android Marshmallow is likely to commence its worldwide deployment with Android device users slated to get a first-hand experience of the latest Google mobile OS. The five Android N developer previews gave us a great look at future Android 7.0 Nougat features. Of course, developer previews quite often contain features that don’t make it to the final release and there’s plenty more stuff that Google might have added since the last developer preview. Based on the various previews, public statements and credible leaks, we have compiled most of the Android 7.0 features you can expect to see in the next Android version. Quick Settings toggle behavior fixed The familiar toggle on/off action for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in the Quick Settings was removed. In its place, tapping the toggles launched the menu screen for each setting. This, naturally, infuriated Android users everywhere to such a frightening degree that Google fix it. Cat-catching Easter Egg This is the most fun thing. The Android N Easter Egg is a peculiar cat-catching game based on pre-Pokémon GO-era cat-catching game Neko Atsume (Neko meaning “cat” in Japanese). The premise is simple: lay out treats for cats, who will intermittently drop by (in your notifications) for a feed. “Catch” them and share with your friends. App source now shown in App info While the functionality has been laying dormant in Android for a long time, dev preview 5 now surfaces the source information for apps. This means that when you tap App Info for a particular app, the OS will display whether it was installed via the Play Store or side-loaded/sourced from a third-party site like Amazon. The feature is likely just there to help technicians or developers diagnose potentially problematic apps sourced from outside Google Play. New Google Camera with customizable volume button actions The new Google Camera 4.1 comes pre-loaded on Android N dev preview 5 and it adds a couple of nice new features. First up, csutomizable volume key actions. This means you can tell the Android OS what you want volume up and down to do while in Google Camera. Choose from zoom, shutter and volume for now. The three on-screen settings – timer, HDR and flash – now show their options in a full-width view. When accessing previously taken photos, the Google Photos icon has been replaced with an “All Photos” label in the top right hand corner and you can now double tap to zoom in instantly. The three on-screen settings – timer, HDR and flash – now show their options in a full-width view. When accessing previously taken photos, the Google Photos icon has been replaced with an “All Photos” label in the top right hand corner and you can now double tap to zoom in instantly. You can no longer display manual exposure settings. This year, rather than wait until Google I/O 2016, Google decided to release the first Android N developer preview on March 9, two full months earlier than expected. The Android N preview went live for the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 9 (Wi-Fi and LTE), Nexus Player and Pixel C on the Android Developers site. New Quick Settings options for developers This one is likely to vanish before the final Android 7.0 build rolls out, but for now, there are two new options in the Edit menu of the Quick Settings. “Show layout bounds” and “Profile GPU rendering” both now appear as optional tiles. VR mode options now appear in Display Settings The setting is now showing up in the Display settings in dev preview 5. At the bottom there is now a setting called “When device is in VR mode” with options for “use low motion blur settings” and “do nothing”. A teardown will soon reveal further VR mode integration. Camera twist gesture added If you’re a fan of the funky wrist twist gesture to launch the camera in certain Motorola devices, you’ll be pleased to know the same function was added to the final Nougat feature. Custom Pointer and other final APIs The fourth Dev Preview contains the final Android 7.0 APIs and SDK. One of those final APIs is the Custom Pointer API, which will be utilized by devs to get their apps ready for keyboard and mouse control, essential for Android apps on Chrome OS. API 24 is the new target for developers and they are now able to publish apps supporting API 24 to Google Play in the alpha, beta and production release channels. Android Auto navigation is broken This is hardly a feature, but it has cropped up enough on the Android bug tracker to warrant the attention of the Android team. Remember, Android N is a developer release, so things occasionally get broken. You can rest assured it will be working again by the time your devices get the official Android 7.0 update though. The 2016 Nexus devices For sure Sailfish and Marlin/the Nexus 6P (2016) and Nexus 5X (2016) – or whatever they will be called this year – will be arriving on the same date as Nougat but it seems unlikely considering the lack of concrete leaks. It’s more likely that the 2016 Nexuses, both of which will be made by HTC, will come a little later than Nougat, but probably still earlier than in previous years. We might see this year’s Nexuses earlier in September rather than the end of the month if the progressively earlier announcement dates are anything to go by. There has been a steady stream of pre-release leaks regarding Android Nougat and the new Nexuses. Some of the leaks you may have seen recently will likely be Nexus-only features and not be common to all devices running Android Nougat. Google has already spoken about offering special software features only on the Nexuses in what we can only imagine is Google’s idea of actually “promoting” its device line. Some of those features include navigation control via fingerprint scanner gestures, new Google Assistant features.   TAGS Android Android N Google Mobile Industry Operating Systems Editor RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Emirates and Google to promote reading in Arabic Google Assistant aims to upstage Siri and Alexa Global Mobile Trends Report: Industry Shift to Asia, Rise of the Mobile Internet Meet Google Duo, a simple 1-to-1 video calling app Go bananas for the 2016 Doodle Fruit Games How to get the Windows 10 Anniversary Update Launch of Ecosystem Accelerator Innovation Fund – Call for Applications from Start-Ups New additions to the Android TV and Google Cast family Is your Android smartphone malware infected to net a $300,000 monthly paycheck As expected, Android apps on Chromebook launch with bugs Apple shows off iOS 10 and MacOS Sierra; Siri, Apple Maps, and Apple Music revamped The Android Update: the N-Release, Virtual Reality, Android Studio 2.2 and more 1 COMMENT Joseph August 31, 2016 at 12:44 pm Any update on the release date??

There’s now a third option: a simple personal identification number. In a recent Google + post, Google developer François Beaufort outlined how to use the feature: All you have to do is enable the flag chrome://flags/#quick-unlock-pin, restart Chrome, and go to Chrome Material Design settings page for now to set up your Lock Screen PIN in the new "Screen Lock" section. When it's done, lock your screen with + L and enjoy the new unlock experience! He noted that the feature is still experimental, but that it should make things slightly easier for users. According to OMG! Chrome, the feature is part of the latest Canary Build for the operating system, and it will allow users to input a four-digit PIN rather than their entire Google account password. This is only used for the lock screen and won’t replace the initial login to start up your computer. If you have a long, complicated password, this would make it easier to get back to work.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Glass fans, including author Mike Elgan, thought Google Glass would change the world. And it looks like it will. More like this Finally: Smart glasses that don't look dumb Google Glass mysteries revealed! Why I'm still excited about Google Glass Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware The single most innovative wearable of all time has to be Google Glass. Yeah, I said it. And it's true. If you read the tech blogs, you'd be forgiven for believing that Google Glass is a failed product, dead and gone. But in fact, the opposite is true. The Google Glass Explorer program succeeded wildly. Google is feverishly working on new kinds of Google Glass products, and the innovation around Google Glass never stopped. Wait, what was Google Glass again? On April 15, 2013, Google launched its Explorer program for Google Glass. It was a kind of unique beta program set up not only to test the product but also to find out what people might do with it. The smart glasses cost $1,500. (Some, including me, believed that the high price was in part to keep away casual, nonserious users. High cost was a feature, not a bug.) For most of the Explorer program, Google Glass was available by invitation only. While Google Glass was slammed for being unpopular, Google had, in fact, worked hard to keep the number of users small. Google Glass runs on an operating system called Glass OS, and most of the components inside are similar or identical to smartphone parts. Glass has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of flash storage, plus a camera, a microphone, an accelerometer, a gyroscope and an ambient light sensor. But Google Glass also has unique parts, like a 640-×-360-pixel prism projector that beams the screen into the wearer's right eye. A touchpad on the right side enables gesture control, and you can take 5-megapixel pictures by winking. It also captures video. On Jan. 15, 2015, Google announced that it would end the Explorer program and move the Glass operation from the Google X lab into a product development group. This transition from research beta to product development was falsely reported as a "failure." (Greenlighting a research program as a full-blown product line does not suggest failure. And a product that has not shipped yet cannot be called a failure.) Google is even still actively providing free tech support to Google Glass users. Google! Providing tech support! In fact, Google Glass is one of the most exciting pre-products in the history of technology. Even the discontinued test version is the foundation of multiple revolutions in science and industry. The actual Google Glass products will probably dominate the future of wearables. Forget the tech press's false narrative around Google Glass. Here's what's happening with one of the most revolutionary products ever. What people are using Google Glass for right now Airplane and aerospace giant Boeing is using Google Glass to help the people who make airplanes. Glass solved a problem that Boeing had for years, which is how to streamline the connection of aircraft wire harnesses, a process that normally required massive amounts of paperwork. Now, airplane assembly workers get needed information hands-free using Glass's voice-activation feature while they use their hands to do the actual construction. Boeing is also looking into the use of Google Glass on the International Space Station. Doctors and surgeons of all kinds are using Google Glass to record procedures, access medical information hands-free and consult with specialists. Glass is so popular in the medical community that a San Francisco-based digital health startup called Augmedix is offering a Glass-based medical note-taking service for use while examining a patient. The company claims that hundreds of doctors are using the service. Stanford University is reportedly conducting groundbreaking research into helping people with autism read others' emotions using Google Glass. Called the Autism Glass Project, the study is testing a special Google Glass app with children ranging in age from 6 to 17. The app uses facial recognition software to identify the emotions expressed on other people's faces, and then tells the test subject what emotion is being expressed. The idea is to use the Glassware (Google Glass software) to train people with autism so that over time they can identify emotions on their own, without Glass. Study participants also learned to look at people's faces more often and make more eye contact. In England, researchers at Newcastle University have been studying multiple ways in which Google Glass might help sufferers of Parkinson's disease cope better, from improving their walking to helping them understand when they're not speaking loudly enough. Google Glass is being used in one of the world's most successful efforts to stop rhinoceros poaching. The people involved in the project, which is taking place in Chitwan National Park in Nepal, are using a combination of dogs, drones and Google Glass as part of a comprehensive effort to stop poachers and study rhinos. These are just a few of the ways even the beta version of Google Glass is being used to change the world. Just wait until Google Glass actually ships! What we know about Google's plans for the future of Google Glass Google is working on a Glass Enterprise Edition for business and industrial use. The Enterprise Edition is similar to the Explorer edition from the beta program, but the eyewear has hinges, so the Glass hardware can be folded like regular glasses. It also has a different kind of connector that has been compared to Apple's MagSafe technology. It also has a prism unit that presumably shows a larger screen than the beta version. A prototype of the Explorer edition even showed up on eBay earlier this year. It was being sold by a San Francisco pawn shop. It's a no-brainer that companies will use Google Glass and other smart eyewear technologies -- even some Glass critics acknowledge that. But Glass is also coming to the consumer market. A couple of years ago, Google and Italian glasses giant Luxottica announced a partnership to develop Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses using Google Glass technology. When the first commercial Google Glass headsets ship, we can expect sunglasses from these companies as well. (Neither Google nor Luxottica immediately replied to my request for details on the current state of the partnership.) Patents don't always reveal what types of products companies will actually ship, but Google's many Glass patents suggest ideas and directions. Last week, a new patent emerged showing a future version of Google Glass with some new features. One is the option to use standard rechargeable or disposable batteries -- AAA, AA or 9-volt. This would be valuable for people using Glass far away from electrical outlets, or without the time to charge between uses. The battery options sound to me like a stopgap to solve the problem of Glass's short battery life until better battery technology can be developed. The same patent also shows a redesigned headset that may be more comfortable to wear. This is only the latest of many Google Glass patents that have emerged since the Explorer program. How Google Glass has influenced technology With its Glass initiative, Google pioneered and popularized the use of smart glasses, and the effort is now having an impact in other markets. The U.S. women's track cyclists won a silver medal at the Rio Olympics. One of their advantages was Google Glass-like Solos smart cycling glasses, which they used for training. The special sunglasses feature heads-up displays that provide real-time stats, so the cyclists can track their performances without taking their eyes off the road. Heads-up displays that work similar to the Google Glass version are coming out for all kinds of sports, including skiing and scuba diving. The consumer market will be affected as well. One of the best uses of Google Glass was the camera, which you could activate with a button, a touchpad or a voice command, or by simply winking your eye. A product now being crowdfunded in Japan called the Blincam emulates that feature. The Blincam itself is a camera that clips on the side of a pair of regular glasses or sunglasses. When it detects a blink, it takes a picture, then uploads it to your phone via Bluetooth. The company plans to demo the product for the first time at TechCrunch Disrupt in September and sell it on Amazon and elsewhere next year. I believe the experiential live video trend I talked about recently in this space will drive huge demand for eye-level cameras, including consumer versions of Google Glass as well as copycat products. When the Pokémon Go craze hit last month, I heard a lot of chatter about how great it would be to play Pokémon Go with Google Glass. And so it would. More to the point, Pokémon Go is popularizing and mainstreaming mixed reality. This makes the consumer world safe for Google Glass again. Although Hololens and Magic Leap will no doubt provide a much higher-resolution experience for mixed reality, the arrival of these products in mobile versions at affordable prices is many years in the future. The bottom line is that the Glassholes were right and the naysayers were wrong. Google Glass is already changing the world. And it hasn't even shipped yet.

Much of the coverage has focused on the backlash Google is receiving despite their issuing of a press releases that maintains it action was merely a technical error.

What are the top 10 most popular search engines? 09 Aug 16 | Author Christopher Ratcliff | Search Search Marketing SEO Stats Tweet You know, apart from the most obvious search engine. And possibly the second most obvious one too. In fact I’ll start again, what are the eight most popular search engines after Google and Bing? The first list below contains the most popular search engines currently available, ordered by most to least popular in the US. The ranking is according to eBiz, it’s in order of estimated unique monthly visitors and is accurate as of August 2016. The second list is a global overview of most popular search engines, according to Net Market Share, which is ranked in order of market share and is again accurate as of August 2016. As opposed to our previous list of search engine alternatives to Google, this list will concentrate purely on informational searches rather than say… Gifs or copyright free images. US 1) Google Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 1.6 billion Alexa Rank: 1 Why should you use it? With 72.48% of the world’s market share of search, as a marketer you don’t really have a choice not to use it for both paid and organic reach. As an every day user, for all of our cynicism and occasionally flippant references to The Circle, you have to admit Google is utterly indispensable in your every day life. For every interference (the constant curtailing of organic results) there are 10 triumphs… Google Maps, Gmail, the terrifying relevance of Knowledge Graph, the killing of payday loan ads, AMP… Where the heck would we all be without the… yes, I’m going to say it… search giant. 2) Bing Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 400 million Alexa Rank: 22 Why should you use it? As I said in earlier in the year in the aforementioned ‘alternatives to Google’ post, there are some great reasons to choose Bing: Bing’s video search is significantly better than Google’s. Bing often gives twice as many autocomplete suggestions than Google does. Bing has a great linkfromdomain:[site name] feature that highlights the best ranked outgoing links from that site, helping you figure out which other sites your chosen site links to the most. 3) Yahoo Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 300 million Alexa Rank: n/a Why should you use it? Well that’s all a but up in the air at the moment, as Verizon has just purchased Yahoo for $4.8 billion dollars and is planning on merging it with AoL. Yahoo will continue to operate independently pending regulatory approval of the deal, which is expected to be completed by early 2017. After this, all of Yahoo’s news, finance and sports platforms will be added to AOL’s media assets, which include The Huffington Post and TechCrunch. 4) Ask Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 245 million Alexa Rank: 31 Why should you use it? Despite Google’s determination to be the ultimate font of all knowledge on its own SERP, Ask is still good for specific question related searches, with results centring on Q&A related matches. And hey, sometimes it’s nice to get help from a butler. 5) Aol Search Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 125 million Alexa Rank: n/a Why should you use it? As mentioned above, the AOL you know and possibly love may become a different beast once Verizon Communications merges it with Yahoo. Let’s remember simpler times… 6) Wow Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 100 million Alexa Rank: 767 Why should you use it? Because it works more like a news site then a search engine, which is handy if you want everything in one place. There is a strong lean towards news and celebrity based articles rather than pure Wikipedia-style information, but the handy links to related social channels and wiki pages are useful. 7) WebCrawler Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 65 million Alexa Rank: 674 Why should you use it? WebCrawler has a far clearer delineation between paid search ads and organic results. It also seems to feature far more natural ’blue links’ than Google. 8) MyWebSearch Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 60 million Alexa Rank: 405 Why should you use it? Uh… don’t. According to the Malware Wikia, MyWebSearch is a spyware and search toolbar program that allows the user to query various popular search engines and comes bundled with an exhausting suite of ‘goodies’ such as such as Smiley Central, Webfetti, Cursor Mania, My Mail Stationary, My Mail Signature, My Mail Stamps, FunBuddyIcons… the fun goes on and on. Most damningly of all though, Malware Wikia reports that despite it not carrying any malware attributes, an independent repair lab has classified the toolbar as a nuisance because of “slowdowns in return for features that are already built into many modern web browsers.” 9) Infospace Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 24 million Alexa Rank: 2,110 Why should you use it? You may be using it already… InfoSpace is a “provider of white label search and monetization solutions” and it also operates its own branded search sites, including the metasearch engine Dogpile, as well as Zoo.com and WebCrawler (as mentioned above.) 10) Info.com Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors: 13.5 million Alexa Rank: 1,938 Why should you use it? Info.com aggregates results from the indexed web AND social media channels. It monitors real-time social conversations and according to them, it delivers “newsworthy, trending, and popular results before they hit the indexed web.” These streams are classified into structured topics which provides additional context and insight. Bonus: 11) DuckDuckGo Honourable mention to DuckDuckGo, the new kid on the block that doesn’t store your personal information, which has managed to accrue 13 million unique monthly visitors and is currently the 11th most popular search engine in the US. Worldwide Here’s the marketshare worldwide for search engines… 1) Google – 72.48% 2) Bing – 10.39% 3) Yahoo – 7.78% 4) Baidu – 7.14% 5) Ask – 0.22% 6) AOL – 0.15% 7) Excite – 0.01% Christopher Ratcliff is the editor of Search Engine Watch and a writer at ClickZ.

While AMP is not a ranking signal, at least not yet, this announcement is a milestone for the initiative that Google launched earlier this year in an effort to speed the mobile web. The search giant’s desire to make mobile web pages load faster is obvious: slow, clunky pages that don’t provide a good user experience threaten Google’s mobile ad business. AMP, which is an open standard that consists of slimmed-down HTML and JavaScript, aims to make it possible for publishers to more easily create performant mobile experiences. But for all of AMP’s virtues, websites that have adopted AMP may not be benefiting from the introduction of their AMP pages into Google’s organic mobile search results. In fact, they could be seeing less traffic. As Barry Schwartz of Search Engine Roundtable detailed, he’s seen a lower CTR from AMP pages. Glenn Gabe of G-Squared Interactive speculates that lower CTRs for AMP results could be due to the fact that users don’t know what AMP is, making the AMP icon and text that appears alongside AMP results a CTR killer: Looking back the demo and seeing both AMP icons + mobile-friendly tags, I couldn’t help but think that the average user might understand mobile-friendly way more than AMP with a lightning bolt. And if that’s the case, wouldn’t that yield mediocre results for amplified pages in the search results (at least in the short-term)? And couldn’t that possibly lead to even more click through to mobile-friendly pages versus amplified pages? In an effort to test his hypothesis, Gabe created a quick poll that asked respondents if they knew what AMP referred to, and whether they’re be more likely to click on an “AMP” or “mobile-friendly” search result. Not so surprisingly, only three of the 44 people who responded to the poll knew what AMP was, and only two indicated they’d be more likely to click on an “AMP” result compared to 29 who preferred “mobile-friendly.” While a poll of 44 people is far from scientific, Gabe’s logic – that average consumers who aren’t involved with web development and SEO aren’t likely to know what AMP is – seems sound and raises questions about how Google will educate the public about what AMP is and what benefits it offers. The good news is that Google is almost certainly collecting data about its new AMP results and is likely to take action if it notices lower CTRs across the board for these results. In the meantime, early AMP adopters experiencing lower CTRs have a not so pleasant reminder that being an early adopter can sometimes be a double-edged sword.

With Barrett pulling the strings they were strong, fast and ruthless and Australia’s team, loaded with veterans, looked so far off the pace as to need pacemakers. It seems safe to say Michael Cheika’s selections backfired, though he wasn’t helped by a string of injuries to the outside backs, including the luckless Giteau. If that hotel room was bugged by the Australians (which isn’t to say it was, in fact it seems ludicrous) it wasn’t worth it. Thanks for your company and emails tonight. I’m out. Have a good night.

Here’s NZ captain Kieran Read: “We were still finding it tough out there [sounds like a white lie to me] but our performance was outstanding. The boys certainly worked for it.” The execution let them down in the second half, he says, and they’ll look to improve next week. Improve?! Next week?! Yes, the Wallabies head to Wellington next week before playing at Eden Park in October. Stephen Moore now: “Hard to know what to say, I feel for all the fans who came here tonight. We prepared well and trained hard and thought we were ready to play well tonight. We’ve got to keep going and get ready for next week over there. “We need to be positive. As hard as it is, we’ve another game and we need to turn it around for the fans next week.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.01am EDT 08:01 Fulltime: Australia 8-42 New Zealand It’s over, mercifully.

Would still be All Blacks' biggest win in Australia @PFConnolly August 20, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.57am EDT 07:57 80 min + 1: Another penalty to NZ and they could just kick it out and head to the showers. But there are more wings to pull off the fly so they pack a scrum 5m out from Australia’s line. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.56am EDT 07:56 80 min: Is that another try to New Zealand? We’ve gone to the video ref. After what may have been a NZ knock on, Barrett, in midfield, measured a perfect crossfield kick into the arms of Dagg just inside the right touchline. Despite the attention of Phipps he put the ball down for a try. No try, but it wasn’t because of a NZ knock-on. We’ve gone way back for a NZ penalty for an Australian player entering a ruck from the side. Updated at 8.22am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.53am EDT 07:53 78 min: Barrett finds touch inside Australia’s 22 with a lovely kick.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.51am EDT 07:51 Try! Australia 8-42 New Zealand (Phipps 75) That record margin might not be broken after all. Small mercies. Australia put it through the hands from within the New Zealand 22, short stabby passes that find their way to Phipps on the left wing. He puts his head down low and goes goes goes, burrowing through four tacklers to reach out and score. That’s something. The conversion attempt from wide out is missed. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.47am EDT 07:47 74 min: Read goes to the bin after he’s given a yellow card in his attempts to slow down the play, to prevent the Aussies getting a modicum of pleasure out of this game. That’s what it takes to be an All Black. No mercy. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.46am EDT 07:46 73 min: The Wallabies chip away at the All Blacks’ defensive line like someone trying to break through a prison wall with a tea spoon. But they win a penalty, at least, and find touch a few metres out from the New Zealand line. Can they score a consolation try? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.44am EDT 07:44 70 min: Just when it seems the All Blacks will score another they turn it over a few metres out from the Aussie line. A temporary reprieve no doubt. Polota-Nua finds his own man from a lineout. When the All Blacks have won five lineouts on Australia’s throw that’s an achievement worth mentioning. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.42am EDT 07:42 68 min: My colleague Dan Lucas reminds me that the All Blacks’ biggest ever winning margin over Australia is 37 points. Unless Australia do something soon that record is about to be broken. Speaking of Australia doing something, they win a lineout! Then Kuridrani spills his lollies as he hit the Black line at pace. Oh my.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.36am EDT 07:36 64 min: The Wallabies, standing deep, put it through the hands. Folau, steps inside two defenders off his right foot before being pulled down by Dagg. It might have led to something had Australia not turned the ball over soon after. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.34am EDT 07:34 63 min: I really don’t think the Wallabies can come back from here.

Australia 3-42 (Savea 59) Almost from the restart New Zealand score another! Through the hands the ball flew until Whitelock popped a peach of a pass that led to Barrett finding Savea on the left touchline. He bumped off the cover tackle of Genia to score just inside the corner post. That’s his 40th try in just 44 Tests! Barrett, showing mercy, misses the conversion from the left touchline.

Can’t say the same for Kuridrani who then drops a pass cold which Fekitoa picks up before striding away towards the line. Foley does well to pull him down just short but the All Blacks recycle the ball, spin it right and find Dan Coles on the overlap... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.25am EDT 07:25 54 min: After six phases Australia realise they’ve pushed the envelope and Kefu spills the ball just outside the All Blacks’ 22.

But NZ recover. Of course they do. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.20am EDT 07:20 49 min: Another scrum to Australia, this one 10 m inside NZ territory but Sio turns it over and Cruden is on the tear down field!

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.17am EDT 07:17 47 min: Kieran Read charges towards the line but he knocks the ball foward, helped in the knocking on by a reefing arm from Foley. Scrum to Australia 10m out, Genia with a shaved head, and the ball in hand. A few Wallabies have shaved their heads for this one. If you haven’t heard it’s to show solidarity to ex-Wallaby and Brumbies captain Christian Lealiifano who was recently diagnosed with leukemia. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.14am EDT 07:14 44 min: Another Foley kick is clipped by the defence! And it leads to the All Blacks pouring into the Wallabies’ 22 like malicious molasses. Surely that was a forward pass by Dan Coles but it’s not pulled up and a moment later Cruden grubbers —and Dagg cleans up the dregs. Haylett-Petty, who fumbled that kick, does just enough to keep out Dagg who is held up over the line! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.11am EDT 07:11 42 min: The Wallabies force a turn over (good!) then moments later turn it over themselves (bad!). The All Blacks enjoyed 61% possession in that half and so far in the second nothing has changed. Well maybe a percentage or three. Haven’t seen the stats but it feels like 64%. Naholo is off, by the way, replaced by Julian Savea. Horne is off too. That’s three outside backs down and out in one half of football!

From a scrum in their own half the ball was fed to Foley whose attempted kick downfield was charged down by Kaino, rushing at Foley like an angry Pamplona bull.

Toomua, meantime, on for Giteau, is prostrate, having worn an accidental shoulder from Barrett. He’s heading off for a concussion test. If he’s smart he’ll say he sees three fingers when there are only two before him. The trusty Phil Withall write in to suggest the Wallabies’ concentration could have been better: “Maybe, just maybe, instead of attempting to recreate Watergate the Australians would have been better off focusing on their own game. This could end up worse than anything Kitty Chiller could create.” Matt Toomua lies prone on the turf.

India loves PV Sindhu, but Indians love caste more, says Google. So while a billion of us were rooting for PV Sindhu to outclass Spain's Carolina Marin in Rio on Friday, about 9 lakh Indians back home were on Google looking up for her caste. Sindhu's caste - the search query was relatively slow on Google till August 14 - picked up after the 21-year-old from Hyderabad beat eighth seed Tai Tzu Ying in the pre-quarterfinals. Since that game, the caste search saw a ten-fold jump after her stunning semi-final win over Japan's Nozomi Okuhara. It just peaked on Friday after her silver. In fact till Saturday, Sindhu's caste search topped Google in India over her career and Friday's final. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were the two top states searching for Sindhu's caste and not her silver. The two states' tussle over the champion shuttler stems from the fact that Sindhu was born and brought up in Hyderabad but her mother belongs to Vijayawada.

Anu James   August 20, 2016 12:42 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares PV Sindhu with her silver medalReuters It was not 'PV Sindhu ranking' or 'PV Sindhu images' or even 'PV Sindhu age' that figured among the most searched keywords on Google about the Indian badminton player ahead of her matches in the Olympics. According to Google trends, one of the most searched keywords on the search engine for the past week was, and it may not shock you, 'PV Sindhu caste.' The 21-year-old badminton player, who bagged the silver medal at the Rio Olympics on Friday, Aug. 19, sent Indians all over the world into a celebratory tizzy. She is the first Indian woman to appear in a finals event, since the others before her, including the other star badminton player from the country — Saina Nehwal — had won bronze medals at the quadrennial  event. For some people, however, her successive wins at the various rounds of the Games merited a fact-checking mission of a different kind. Why advertise with us?

PV Sindhu caste is one of the most searchedkeyword on Google.Google/Screenshot Over the past one week, the number of searches for Sindhu's caste has seen a gradual rise on Google after she qualified to the semi-finals.  This particular keyword was most searched from people settled in India, and to be precise, more searches were from Andhra Pradesh and Telengana, where she actually belongs to, according to the Google trend. However, not just Indian residents, but also people settled in Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the UAE have been at the top five spots in searching for the caste that Sindhu belongs to.

Serbia take it out - the Boomers will play for bronze Live feed Show 7.59pm EDT 19:59 That’s it from us It was a dissappointing loss for the Boomers, but they can hardly find fault with the result the way that Serbia dominated that game from the opening minute. When they weren’t being pressured out of the ball, the Australians were sloppy on offence and couldn’t make inroads. At the other end, led by Milos Teodosic, Serbia were just too potent on offence. Thank you all for your company and do make sure you check back in for the gold medal game, which will bit this impressive Serbian squad against the NBA superstars of Team USA.

They need to stay off and rest up. In their absence, Brock Motum drains a corner three in front of the Boomers bench and gives their spirits a bit of a lift.

They’re not his forte and he misses the second one. From the in-bound pass Ingles is stripped of the ball as he drives to the bucket.

With ten minutes to go in this game the Boomers trail by 28 points and will struggle to get much closer. Serbia are too good at both ends of the court and the Boomers couldn’t have played worse. They don’t want a blow-out but really might be better off resting their starters for that bronze medal game. Milos Teodosic has been dominant for Serbia.

You can say the Aussies have been bad but they’re playing a damned fine basketball team. Teodosic has 20 points and four assists, and the Boomers have had no equivalent contributor. Lemanis’ team have not underestimated their opposition here but neither can they match their intensity and offensive prowess.

The only spark is coming from Motum, who lays one up before Teodosic drains a three. The Motum commits an unsportsmanlike foul. At least he’s trying to make things happen. Things aren’t going to plan for Matthew Dellavedova and the Boomers.

Brock Motum is into the game now, perhaps in the hope he can get his mid-range shooting going. Boy do Australia need it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.05pm EDT 19:05 3rd quarter (6:38 remaining) Australia 23-42 Serbia Australians have reason to love him, but geez would it kill Matthew Dellavedova to take a run at an open three here when Andrew Bogut screens off two defenders to open up the gap? Delly just pivots around on his own before round-arming a pass. Ungainly, you’d call it. With a couple of free throws Ingles trims the lead a little.

Photograph: Andrej Isakovic/AFP/Getty Images Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.45pm EDT 18:45 What has gone wrong for the Boomers so far? In a word, everything. They’ve shot terribly, making 6-29 from the field. That’s abominable. They’ve also had no answer for Milos Teodosic at the other end, and if the Serbian star wasn’t already on the radar of NBA teams before he certainly should be now. The Boomers have turned the ball over regularly and lacked anything approaching composure. It’s odd. They’ve looked so mature and battle-ready throughout this tournament but it all fell apart in that first half. They look overawed by the occasion and Serbia’s defence is just suffocating. No Australian is getting a good look and those distributing the ball have been hassled into regular turnovers.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.38pm EDT 18:38 2nd quarter (1:39 remaining) - Australia 14-32 Serbia Now Baynes takes a seat and he’s not looking happy with himself. Damian Martin is on for him as Australia go for some ‘small ball’, and Delly is back shortly thereafter. Australia’s 2-11 shooting for threes and 4-14 from two-point range. Serbia, on the other hand, are finding scoring a piece of cake. As it stands, the Boomers look like a team who’ll be playing for bronze unless they can pull off something remarkable. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.35pm EDT 18:35 2nd quarter (3:01 remaining) - Australia 14-28 Serbia Baynes is also well off for the Aussies tonight and misses another post move hooking around onto his left. Teodosic takes a rest, which is good news for the Boomers as they’ve had no answer for him tonight. Raduljica drives past Baynes to draw a foul and nails both free throws. He’s played in the NBA too, Raduljica, and it shows. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.33pm EDT 18:33 2nd quarter (3:50 remaining) - Australia 14-26 Serbia Kalinic makes a couple of free throws and Serbia continue to look the team to beat. The Aussies haven’t even done enough to get to the free throw line but they do score from a frenetic drive from Mills, but he misses a three soon after, as does Ingles. Oh dear, they need to make those to get back into this one. Both were good looks.

How do they get back into this game? Dellavedova is lacking his usual fire so it might have to be Patty Mills to provide the spark plug. There’s been eight turnovers from six different Boomers.

At the other end the Boomers are being caned by Teodosic, who scores again from mid range and draws a foul too, which he makes. Australia call another time out to regroup.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.25pm EDT 18:25 2nd quarter (6:49 remaining) - Australia 10-21 Serbia The hyper-physical defence continues as Dellavedova virtually tackles Teodosic but somewhat surprisingly it’s only Australia’s third foul. Teodosic soon moves his way to nine points for the game and Macvan gets two as well.

The 25-year-old from Frankston rains down a big three from well beyond the line and that’s the perfect start for the Boomers. He was six feet out from the line, at least. Broekhoff knows this Euro-ball well and is certainly not intimidated by the fact that both sides are playing it like a game of rugby. Ingles then lays it up in transition and the Australians have the first five points as Serbia call time out.

Australia trail by 11 points but to be honest with you, they couldn’t have played much worse on offence so the damage isn’t actually too bad. Lemanis needs to draw up a few plays though. There’s just been zero scoring threat at all.

Teodosic misses a three and then also a mid-range jump shot, but at the other end Serbia is happy for Joe Ingles to shoot because his range is well off. Delly tries to slow things down and finds Baynes in the post for an easy dunk. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.08pm EDT 18:08 1st quarter (5:41 remaining) - Australia 3-12 Serbia Every Australian shot is a tough one for now but at the other end, Teodosic is finding space and shooting beautifully.

Mills hits a corner three and the Australians are finally on the board. They needed that. The defence has been smothering from Serbia and Dellavedova is harried out of possession; he seems a little scrambled so far.

This is going to be a real slog, though that won’t scare the Aussies, who love the rough stuff.

Australia: Matthew Dellavedova, Patty Mills, Joe Ingles, Aron Baynes, Andrew Bogut Aus bench: David Andersen, Kevin Lisch, Ryan Broekhoff, Chris Goulding, Brock Motum, Damian Martin, Cameron Bairstow (injured). Serbia: Milos Teodosic, Stefan Markovic, Milan Macvan, Nikola Kalinic, Miroslav Raduljica Serbia bench: Marko Simonovic, Vladimir Stimac, Nikola Jokic, Stefan Jovic, Nemanja Nedovic, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Stefan Bircevic. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.45pm EDT 17:45 Preamble Hello all and welcome to this live coverage as Australia’s Boomers move towards the uncharted territory of a potential medal in the men’s basketball. Their opponents in this semi-final are Serbia, who they beat by 15 points in the preliminary games but will doubtless prove a harder obstacle today. If Australia has been the revelation of this basketball tournament, the Serbians are equally potent. Veteran Milos Teodosic is a star (how is he not in the NBA?) and the likes of Miroslav Raduljica, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Nikola Jokic go reasonably well too. They were very impressive in holding their nerve in a virtual free throw shoot-out in the final minute of the quarters against Croatia. The Australians most of us know well for their NBA exploits - Delly, Millsy, Baynesy and, err, Boguty. They’re playing with fire and spirit in these Games but also, just whisper it...they’re actually good enough at this point to win games like this. We shall see.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (5) Post your comment Some of Allos new sticker packs leak, and theyre a bit risque 19 August, 2016 Google recently launched Duo, the companys newest mobile video calling app set out to directly rival with Facetime. Googles Duo was only released a few days ago and it is already sitting at number one in the Google Play Store and reached top 30 on the iOS app store. All this thanks to Duos dead simple setup which only requires a mobile number to be confirmed via SMS. Android Police has gotten their hands on a tester build of the unreleased Allo app which Google announced back at Google I/O this year promising a smart messenger that can predict your answers and learns how you communicate with your friends. There are many sticker packs with weird, outrageous and somewhat suggestive stickers. Some sticker packs for Google Allo You will be able to download sticker packs and arrange them in any order youd like under My Stickers. And although these stickers are in the test build of the app, there is no guarantee that theyll make it to the final product. There will probably be some people who are easily offended by these stickers who take life too seriously. Check out the full post from Android Police with more sticker pack screenshots at the source link below.

Chrome apps, however, will remain supported by Chrome OS for the foreseeable future.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google announced that it will be gradually phasing out support for Chrome apps on Windows, Mac and Linux, eventually only supporting the apps on the Chrome OS. According to Google, there are two types of Chrome apps, namely hosted apps and packaged apps. Hosted apps are currently implemented as regular web apps, which makes them accessible to all users with an internet connection. Google has found, on the other hand, that only about 1 percent of Windows, Mac and Linux users actively use packaged Chrome apps. With this information, Google revealed through a blog post that it will now begin to remove support for hosted and packaged Chrome apps for Windows, Mac and Linux over the next couple of years. The Chrome apps, however, will remain supported by Chrome OS for the foreseeable future, with upcoming enhancements to Chrome apps only to apply to Chrome OS devices and developers only now allowed to build Chrome apps for Chrome OS. Beginning late this year, new Chrome apps can only be accessed by Chrome OS users. All current Chrome apps, however, will remain accessible on all platforms, with developers allowed to release updates for them. By next year's second half, there will be no more Chrome apps for Windows, Mac and Linux on the Chrome Web Store, and by early 2018, users with computers on these operating systems will no longer be able to use Chrome apps. This gives time for users to find alternatives, and for developers to build out the affected apps into standard web apps. Chrome OS has been a success for Google, as because of the low price of the computers using the operating system and its relative ease to manage, Chromebooks have been increasing their presence in corporate and educational settings. However, Chrome OS does not have as many apps compared to the massive app libraries of Windows and Mac. As a solution, Google released Chrome apps, which allowed developers to create web apps that functioned similarly to traditional standalone apps. The selling point was that these Chrome apps were universal, and did not require any extra effort from developers to make them compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux computers as users on these platforms can access the apps through the Chrome browser. The experiment was an interesting one, to say the least, but it has apparently failed. In addition to ending support for Windows, Mac and Linux users due to very low adoption figures, the fact that Android apps will soon be coming to Chrome OS paints a bleak forecast for Chrome apps.

Some of the most-popular among these include SwiftKey, Fleksy or even Google Keyboard. Almost all of these keyboard apps have some sort of cloud integration built-in, which automatically saves our frequently used words and jargons. Based on the words saved, the keyboard apps then predict the next word a user is going to type before they even think about it. This 'auto-complete' feature thus not only saves times, but also makes the apps' AI-based prediction engines better over the time. I started off with stock Google keyboard a few years ago, but soon got bored of it as it lacked a number of features at the time. Then I switched to SwiftKey (main app) and used it for a couple of years, following it up by Fleksy and then reverting to SwiftKey (Beta). So last week, I decided to have some fun by relying completely on the keyboard's auto-complete feature for each of my replies for 24 hours. As expected, it turned out to be quite a day as I indulged in endless (and pointless) arguments with people almost all the time. Because of the nature of my job I have to stay in touch with my editor and a whole lot of people for news at almost all the times, whether it's over Google Hangouts, WhatsApp, Email or even Slack. I did not warn anyone about this upcoming (potential) catastrophe and started my day by chatting with my editor like this. Editor: Hi, have we covered the Facebook story? Me: I know you are the best person who can give me a call from a #beer bottle while coming back to office. Well. This happened on WhatsApp and if you look at it, this is not the best thing that could happen early morning (provided your editor is already not mad at you for some other reason). So I naturally got a "What?" from my editor, to which my keyboard decided to once again give the most absurd reply ever. The conversation didn't go for long as soon after the reply I got a direct call from him (was expecting this). Not only I messed up in the office but also managed to piss off a PR (who also happen to be close friends of mine), when she asked about my weekend plans. Friend: Hey, what's the weekend scene? Now, when I say I made her go angry, it was on certain levels. I started off by replying. And as a co-incidence she had quit her job recently. It went worse in the next few threads, resulting in both of us abusing each other. She's still angry. While this was on WhatsApp, things got really funny over email. On the mail you can't just get away with a one-line answer. So this is what I wrote to one of the company's executives, in reply to a query related to a gadget. I can't say how seriously the person took it, but I never got a reply back from him. As mentioned above, there was no secret study behind me completely relying on the keyboard auto-complete word prediction feature. However, this led me to conclude that keyboard auto-complete is something that still has a lot of room for improvement. Also, the companies need to make the feature more secure and stable as recently, we saw SwiftKey faced with a bug that showed users word predictions from strangers' smartphones, revealing their names, address, contact numbers and more. That said, auto-prediction, a feature that was once a mere figment of imagination, has come a long way over the years, with more powerful and improved AI running behind the scenes. I am waiting for the day when it becomes so advanced that it could churn out sentences that really make sense and are actually what we intend to type.

Google's cloud platform group this week announced general availability of Cloud Bigtable, a fully managed database service capable of handling petabyte- scale workloads. The announcement was one of three from the Cloud Platform Group this week. Google this week also announced general availability of its Cloud Datastore managed NoSQL database service and talked up its existing and forthcoming support for applications built in Microsoft's ASP.Net environment. Cloud Bigtable is a technology that Google has used internally for several years. It powers many of Google's most heavily used services, such as Gmail, Search, Maps and Analytics. It is designed to handle very large data sets at high speeds. According to Google, that makes it well-suited for analytical and operational applications, such as financial data analysis, internet of things and user analytics. Google has previously described Bigtable as delivering more than double the performance of other NoSQL technologies, such as Cassandra and Hbase, while running faster and delivering a lower total cost of ownership. Google built Bigtable to "handle use cases ranging from low latency real-time data serving to high-throughput web indexing and analytics," Misha Brukman, product manager for Google Cloud Bigtable, wrote in a blog post announcing general availability of the technology. Over the years, Bigtable has had a big impact on the NoSQL database ecosystem and inspired other scalable database technologies like Hbase and Cassandra, he said. Google this week also announced general availability of a new API for customers of its Cloud Datastore NoSQL database service. The new v1 API for Cloud Datastore enables enterprises to access their Google Compute Engine database or their Google Container Engine database from a broader range of endpoints and computing environments. In addition to enabling better cross-platform access to Datastore, Google this week also announced several resources that are available to companies to help them use the technology more effectively. One is a new, simplified method for calculating database size for pricing purposes. Another is a set of best practices for managing Datastore transactions and ensuring consistent querying of the database. In addition to the product- and service-related announcements Google this week also touted its support for applications built on Microsoft's ASP.NET. In a blog post, Chris Sells, product manager of cloud developer tools at Google, pointed to several examples where he claimed the company has made it easier for enterprises to run ASP.NET applications on Google's cloud. For instance, Google supports the ability for organizations to create new Compute Engine virtual machines from a Windows Server Data Center base image, he said. In addition, Google has released several new versions of SQL Server that will be available as base images on Google Compute Engine along with Windows Server, Sells said. "With Windows Server, ASP.NET and SQL Server, you've got everything you need to bring your ASP.NET 4.x sites and services to Google Cloud Platform," Sells noted. "We think you're going to be happy that you did."             LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   New Tool Shines Light on $5 Billion Web Traffic Fraud Racket Microsoft's Azure Advisor Helps Customers Float Cloud Applications Early Stage Startup Heptio Aims to Make Kubernetes Friendly Google, Intel to Collaborate on Cloud, IoT Technolgies Social Media Sites Take Risks When Blocking Speech They Don't Like                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Business Home LBoard Family cremates wrong body after hospital mix-up FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US AT&T, Apple, Google to work on ‘robocall’ crackdown Reuters | August 20, 2016 AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the "Robocall Strike Force" that held its first meeting with the US Federal Communications Commission. WASHINGTON: More than 30 major technology and communication companies said on Friday they are joining the US government to crack down on “robocalls,” automated, prerecorded phone calls that regulators have labeled a “scourge.” AT&T Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp are among members of the “Robocall Strike Force” that held its first meeting with the US Federal Communications Commission. The strike force will report to the FCC by Oct. 19 on “concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions,” said AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson, chairman of the group. The strike force hopes to implement Caller ID verification standards to help block calls from spoofed phone numbers and consider a “Do Not Originate” list that would block spoofers from impersonating legitimate phone numbers from governments, banks or others. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in July urged major companies to take new action to block robocalls, which often come from telemarketers or scam artists. “This scourge must stop,” Wheeler said on Friday, calling robocalls the No. 1 complaint from consumers. “The bad guys are beating the good guys with technology,” Wheeler said. In the past, he has said robocalls continue “due in large part to industry inaction.” Stephenson emphasized “the breadth and complexity” of the problem. “This is going to require more than individual company initiatives and one-off blocking apps,” Stephenson said. “Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop.” The FCC does not require robocall blocking and filtering but has strongly encouraged phone service providers to offer those services at no charge. The strike force brings together carriers, device makers, operating system developers, network designers and the government. “We have to come out of this with a comprehensive play book for all of us to go execute,” Stephenson said. “We have calls that are perfectly legal, but unwanted, like telemarketers and public opinion surveyors. At the other end of the spectrum, we have millions of calls that are blatantly illegal.” Stephenson said technical experts representing the companies have had “preliminary conversations about short- and longer-term initiatives.” Joan Marsh, AT&T vice president of federal regulatory issues, called the problem complicated. “We have been wrangling with this problem long enough to know there is no silver bullet,” she said. “Nothing by itself is going to do it.” Other companies taking part include Blackberry Ltd (BB.TO), British Telecommunications Plc, Charter Communications Inc, Frontier Communications, LG Electronics Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nokia Corp, Qualcomm Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Sirius XM Holdings Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and US Cellular Corp. Consumers Union, a public advocacy group, said the task force is a sign “phone companies are taking more serious steps to protect their customers from unwanted calls.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Now, Google is trying to send that same message to enterprises. The last Google database services still in beta moved into general availability this week, as the cloud provider made a handful of other upgrades to Google Compute Engine. The enhancements are part of a continued push to make headway with enterprise customers by signaling that Google's platform is production-ready. The Google database services now fully available include the latest version of Cloud SQL, which targets MySQL databases and supplants the first generation that was rolled out five years ago. It's Google's equivalent to Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Relational Database; and the newest iteration, which is built on persistent disk, represents an improvement of seven times in speed and 20 times more storage than its predecessor, according to Google. Cloud Bigtable is now fully available for NoSQL databases. The fully managed service is intended for next-generation applications that require low latency or high throughput at petabyte scale. Lytics, a personalized marketing and customer data platform provider based in Portland, Ore., moved from AWS to Google Cloud Platform a year ago. And six weeks ago, it moved from Apache Cassandra to Bigtable. The company went from 60 nodes to a six-node Bigtable cluster, and the service is costing about one-third of what they were paying before, said Aaron Raddon, CTO and co-founder. With Bigtable, there's zero maintenance; you just plug it in and get the same, amazing, fast performance. Aaron RaddonCTO and co-founder of Lytics "Cassandra, we loved, but you had to be really careful to design the keys really well, or you'd get hot spots on the server, which is not a good situation," Raddon said. "With Bigtable, there's zero maintenance; you just plug it in and get the same, amazing, fast performance." Cloud Datastore, another fully managed NoSQL database service that Google says handles over 15 trillion queries per month, is now available via an API. This extends the existing service beyond App Engine. All of these Google database services now fall under the provider's cloud service-level agreement, offering a certain level of uptime assurances for customers that demand high availability. Handwritten invite for enterprises For the first time, we are seeing Diane Greene's handwriting. Holger Muellerprincipal analyst and vice president at Constellation Research Google is seen as a distant third in the public cloud behind Microsoft Azure and market leader Amazon Web Services, and its relationship with enterprise clients has been particularly lacking. VMware founder and former CEO Diane Greene was brought in to head Google's cloud division last November to "teach the enterprise to Google," and we're starting to see her effect on the strategy for the platform, said Holger Mueller, principal analyst and vice president at Constellation Research Inc., based in Cupertino, Calif. "For the first time, we are seeing Diane Greene's handwriting," he said. Google is smart to push its big data chops, which is an area of strength for the company, Mueller said. It uses premium hardware compared to many of its competitors, which can translate to better performance for next-generation applications. Other upgrades to the platform include the beta release of the ability to run Microsoft SQL Server on Compute Engine with existing application licenses; an increase in read and write IOPS for solid-state drive-backed persistent disk volumes, from 15,000 to 25,000; and faster retrieval times from Google Nearline cold storage.

Google Releases Chrome Extension That Restores Backspace as "Back" Button GO Google removed Backspace shortcut support in Chrome 52 Aug 20, 2016 01:10 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google has published a Chrome extension named Go Back With Backspace, thus restoring a feature the company removed from its browser in Chrome 52, which was released at the start of August. Back in May, to the dismay of a large majority of its users, Google announced it would remove the "navigate back" functionality of the Backspace keyboard shortcut, which doubled for so many years as a "Back" button. Four in 10,000 users used the Backspace key as a Back button Google explained its decision by saying that only 0.04 percent of all Chrome users used the keyboard shortcut to navigate back. Additionally, 0.005 percent of those Backspace presses (and "back" navigations) came on web pages containing forms, meaning the user most likely pressed it by accident and lost all the form's data, requiring to refill all the fields. As such, the company decided to improve the browser's UX (User Experience) by removing the ability to go back to the previous page by pressing the Backspace button. Chrome's more hardcore users didn't like the change, and the company was on the receiving end of some hate-filled criticism. Eventually, the Chrome community moved on, and developers created Chrome extensions that replaced the functionality when Chrome 52 came out at the start of August, and the feature was officially removed from Chrome's codebase. Google decides to release official extension In the past, Chrome extension developers had been known to suddenly change their mind and start delivering malicious code or ads via extensions that became very popular. Most likely to avoid this kind of developers from taking advantage of Chrome users looking for an alternative, Google has now released an official extension that replicates the original functionality. The Go Back With Backspace extension works by loading some JavaScript code on your page and nothing else. The extension works just like the original feature, but not on Chrome internal pages (those starting with "chrome://"). At the time of writing, the extension has only over 10,000 installs, meaning Google was right in removing the Backspace functionality since it wasn't that popular among its regular non-tech users. #Google Chrome#Backspace#Go Back With Backspace#Chrome extension#Chrome subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Will Discontinue Chrome Apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux in Early 2018 Google Working on New OS That's Not Android, Chrome OS, or Linux-Related Google Will Kill Flash in Chrome by the End of the Year Chrome 52 Released with Support for CSS Containment and Performance Measurement iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Go Back With Backspace Chrome extension Related Apps SkyHistory: Record and save your Skype chat history and call logs with this application that offers contact management and bookmarking of important messages Outlook4Gmail: Synchronize your Outlook and Gmail accounts by transferring all the important data like contacts and calendar events between them Emby Server: A media server that you can use to organize your entire video, audio and photo collection and access it remotely from multiple devices WebSite Auditor: Enable on-page optimization for your website and assure its place in the top rankings of Google thanks to this comprehensive SEO program Betternet: Navigate the Internet anonymously or with a different IP address and get the opportunity to visit any website, using this VPN server application SEO SpyGlass: Monitor and manage the backlinks for your website in order to increase its online popularity and overall visibility, with the help of this handy tool Rank Tracker: Monitor your website's search engine rankings with the help of this comprehensive and reliable application, dedicated to webmasters Reader comments Load old comments   President-Elect Donald Trump Says He’ll No Longer Go Bananas Online more on: Donald Trump i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Aug 19, 2016 at 5:55PM Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has lots of cash, and the business produces massive amounts of money on a recurrent basis. This could sound like the typical "nice problem to have" situation -- however, that money is not currently being used very efficiently.  If management wanted to go shopping for high-growth companies in the tech sector, players such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) could be interesting candidates to consider. Alphabet should go shopping According to financial reports for the second quarter of 2016, Alphabet has nearly $78.46 billion in cash and equivalents plus marketable securities on its balance sheet. The business is also a cash-generating machine: Free cash flow over the trailing-12-month period ended in June 2016 amounted to $19.96 billion, a strong increase of 24% year over year. GOOG Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. It makes sense to keep some cash at hand in case of a rainy day, but Alphabet is well beyond covering liquidity needs, especially since the business generates strong and growing free cash flows year after year. The company's cash hoard is mostly invested in low-risk assets such as U.S. government notes, and these kinds of securities are currently paying historically low interest rates.  Since Alphabet doesn't really need to keep all that money in cash, investing in smaller companies with attractive growth potential could be a far more profitable idea. Especially when it comes to companies such as Netflix and Twitter, which have a lot to offer in terms of synergies.  Tuning in to Netflix Netflix could be an interesting acquisition target for Alphabet, and a deal between the two companies would surely change the competitive landscape in online streaming. To begin with, Netflix has a market capitalization around $41.2 billion at current prices, meaning that Alphabet has enough financial firepower to swallow Netflix and even pay a substantial premium over current market value. Buying Netflix would allow Alphabet to make big inroads in online video, a key growth area in which Alphabet is already a top player thanks to its ubiquitous YouTube platform. Alphabet's Google launched its YouTube Red subscription service in October of last year, showing that the company is clearly interested in exploring new video monetization venues beyond advertising.  Netflix ended the second quarter of 2016 with 83.2 million members globally. The company has the first-mover advantage in streaming, and a valuable library of content including both licensed and original productions. Netflix and Google together would own two of the most powerful platforms in streaming, a remarkably promising business with spectacular potential for growth over the long term. Content is a key differentiating factor in the industry, and it requires massive amounts of money. Netflix is reportedly planning to spend nearly $5 billion in programming during 2016. By joining forces with Alphabet and its deep pockets, Netflix would have access to plenty of cash to invest in this crucial area.  Should Alphabet finally go after Twitter? There has been plenty of speculation on the possibility of Alphabet buying Twitter lately, and such a move would make sense from multiple points of view. Twitter stock is down by more than 30% in the last 12 months on the back of disappointing user growth over the past several quarters. The company has market capitalization around $13.4 billion at current prices, which makes it quite affordable for a tech juggernaut such as Alphabet. Twitter has 313 million monthly users as of the second quarter of 2016, and the user base expanded by a modest 3% year over year last quarter. Alphabet's Google has seven different services and applications with over 1 billion monthly users each: Google search, Gmail, Chrome, Android, Maps, YouTube, and Google Play. Integrating the two companies could do wonders for Twitter in terms of jump-starting user growth. Google is also the undisputed leader in online advertising, so there could be clear synergies from a fusion in terms of joined monetization strategies. Besides, Google has failed to make inroads in social media, as its Google Plus platform has never really gained much traction among users. Buying Twitter would give Alphabet a strong foothold in social media and access to valuable data on trending topics and consumers' behavior which Twitter has collected over the years. The benefits of an Alphabet move Capital allocation can have a considerable impact on a company and its performance for investors over the years. Alphabet's cash would arguably be much better invested in high-growth companies such as Netflix or Twitter than in fixed-income securities paying minuscule interest rates.

Uber customers in Pittsburgh will be able to order self-driving cars later this month. The ride-sharing service is launching a pilot program to test autonomous vehicles on public streets. As part of the pilot, Uber will place employees in the driver's seat, where they will have their hands on the steering wheel in case something goes wrong. Another employee will be in the passenger seat to observe. Its pilot fleet will consist of specially-equipped Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicles and Ford Focus cars, reported The Wall Street Journal. Uber plans to build partnerships with other carmakers in the future. [Read: Google's Larry Page Investing Millions in Flying Cars] The Volvo SUVs will include sensors that leverage cameras, radar, lasers, and GPS receivers, according to Bloomberg. Volvo Cars produced a few of these vehicles following an agreement with Uber to spend $300 million on creating a fully autonomous car to hit the streets by 2021. The pilot phase could start in as little as two weeks, said The WSJ. Uber plans to start the rollout with a few vehicles and expand to 100 cars throughout Pittsburgh. It will possibly reach other cities in coming months. Driverless cars will be assigned to customers at random, but data such as customer preference, starting location, and length of trip will be considered. To start, Uber is making these trips free of charge and waiving the usual $1.05/mile fee. Uber is the first company to roll out autonomous vehicles to public streets, marking a breakthrough move for the commercialization of driverless cars. However, many consider the move to be controversial, citing passenger safety and job losses as cause for worry. This program is a clear sign Uber plans to eventually replace its massive workforce of drivers with autonomous cars. The company has 600,000 drivers employed within the US, NPR reported, and 1.5 million drivers around the world. For drivers who worry about losing their jobs, it's important to note we're a long way from this concern becoming reality, said Uber to NPR. Self-driving hybrid vehicles that require drivers will "likely win," and human drivers will be required for winding roads and other tricky routes technology can't navigate. Safety is another obvious concern with a program like this one. After all, people prefer autonomous vehicles that don't kill them, and there's an understandable fear of sacrificing driver control to a machine. In another move to advance the autonomous vehicle industry, Uber acquired Ottomotto, a startup with the mission of rethinking transportation with self-driving trucks. The purchase brings together Ottomotto's self-driving vehicles and Uber's Advanced Technologies Center to create a powerhouse of expertise and innovation in the connected-vehicle space. (Image: GoodLifeStudio/iStockphoto) The advancement of driverless cars also marks a step forward for the Internet of Things. The Uber/Ottomotto partnership will generate a massive amount of data and intelligence, given the 1.2 billion miles covered by Uber and Otto each month. Uber is using this data to advance the way its driverless system works, according to the Bloomberg report. The company has been developing detailed maps with roads, lane markings, buildings, fire hydrants, parked cars, and potholes. As the car drives, it compares its observations with preexisting maps so it can identify and avoid pedestrians, stray dogs, and various objects. Uber is one of many companies in the race to gain a piece of the autonomous-vehicle market. Google is a major player in the space. The tech giant has been working on its driverless cars for some time. It recently released a report indicating it's trying to improve safety by creating a vehicle that can honk its own horn. Earlier this year, Google hired drivers to test its driverless cars in Arizona, promising $20 per hour to people who could operate its cars and provide feedback for six to eight hours per day. Automakers Toyota and Acura are also working to advance car technology. In June, Toyota announced plans to integrate self-driving features into its cars over the next 5 years. Acura is working on a self-driving car, with plans for a 2020 release date. Kelly is an associate editor for InformationWeek.

Google Chrome Gaming Apps Being Discontinued Home News Daniel Bompadre August 21st, 2016 - 11:22 AM Buy games related on this topic at | Amazon Google has announced that effective 2017, it will no longer be supporting its app platform for the internet browser Chrome. This means that all game development for those apps will be forced to cease, and back peddle onto a different platform. “We have always believed in making the open, interoperable web as strong as possible”, says vice president of product management Rahul Roy-Chowdhury in a blog post. But he believes ” it’s time to begin the evolution away from the Chrome apps platform.” While the platform certainly has an decent development, its use is paltry comparatively. Chowdhury estimates that only 1% of users on Windows, Mac, and Linux use Chrome apps, and most of the hosted apps are already built in to your web browser.  The platform is simply not being used as much as they had hoped. Google’s plans is that new apps will only be functional on Chrome OS devices, and in 2017, the Web Store itself will not show any apps for Windows, Mac, or Linux. However, the store will still provide extensions and themes for those interested. The software giant is also encouraging developers to transfer their work-in-progress apps to the web, in order to mitigate time loss. According to Gamasutra, Google had recently shut down their Native Client technology, which hosted notable games such as action role playing game hit Bastion. This software had also allowed developers to publish their games onto Steam.

In essence, the banks asked the ACCC to allow them to collectively negotiate with Apple over the terms of its electronic payment system Apple Pay. They have argued that Apple is stifling competition by not allowing banks direct access to the NFC wireless functionality in the iPhone so that they can create their own “digital wallets”. The ACCC has decided not to grant their request, instead it has stated that it needs more time and more consultation before it makes a decision. Only 6 parties had responded to the request despite over 80 different parties being requested to do so. This was principally because the banks were pushing for a response within 28 days which didn’t give anyone time to respond properly. Ultimately, for the ACCC to grant the banks their request to act collectively, they will need to decide whether this is going to be in the best interests of consumers. The fact that it is not immediately obvious that this is clearly not in the interest of consumers reflects a fundamental lack of understanding of the nature of the technology that is being discussed. Apple Pay provides secure access to your credit card not using the details of the card itself, but as an encrypted representation of the card provided by the issuing banks along with a token that is supplied by the card networks Visa, MasterCard and American Express. The encrypted data and tokens are stored in a piece of hardware called the Secure Element, an industry standard, certified chip. This communicates directly with the NFC wireless that in turn communicates with the payment terminals. The main points about this is that the banks are always in control over the transactions that happen and over which cards are added to the phone and how they are validated. This means that from a user perspective, there is absolutely nothing that can be gained from a consumer perspective by having the cards added separately in another digital wallet provided by the banks. For the benefit of the ACCC, it is worth emphasising this point. The functionality of the physical transaction between a card and terminal should absolutely not vary between card providers. What can vary is the functionality that is provided by banks via their own apps for consumers to track payments, pay off card balances, transfer money, etc. Apple Pay does not interfere with this aspect of functionality and so banks can, and do already, provide apps to do this. In fact, there are a large number of disadvantages that consumers would face by having the banks use their own digital wallets to actually load cards and carry out the payments: [1] Each bank would use a different process for loading cards and different security mechanisms for access them to pay with. This would contrast with the ability to pay from the lock screen using the fingerprint scanner using Apple Pay. [2] Customers would have multiple apps to store cards from different providers adding to the burden of updating them in order to make sure they had the latest security updates. [3] There would be no guarantee that banks would have apps updated for new versions of the iPhone operating system with each release – especially for beta versions of the operating system. This would mean that customers could be left without a payment mechanism until some time after new versions of the operating system are released. This was indeed the case with the Commonwealth Bank’s payment system on Samsung phones. [4] Apple Pay will be available through integration with Safari in the next version of iOS. Not having cards in Apple Pay would mean that this functionality would also not be available to customers using digital wallets provided by banks. [5] The banks have basically prohibited the Australian consumer from using their phones for payment in the way that millions of other users are able to. Indeed, the banks are wanting to actually charge customers for that privilege. As I have argued before, there is no chance that Apple will completely overhaul the architecture of its hardware and operating system to accommodate 4 banks in Australia when 3,000 banks worldwide have decided to adopt it. This is not an argument about stifled innovation or enhancing security, in fact, it is the opposite, what is being suggested will diminish both of these. What it is is an attempt for banks to maintain their dominant market power and continue to pass on unnecessary charges to customers. What the ACCC will achieve however by allowing the banks the ability to collectively bargain against Apple is that it will delay other banks and organisations from signing up. Again it is worth stressing that this is not just a fight against Apple, Australian consumers will be prevented from using equivalent systems on Android and Samsung.

Advertisement Jump to Comment The Conversation RECOMMENDED FROM AROUND THE WEB Herbert Allsopp Hey mate, agree with your analysis and insight but it begs the question, why didn’t you make a response to the ACCC in support of the Bank’s application? Surely 28 days is long enough for you, even if it isn’t for a corporation with legal teams and wider relationship considerations. I see an individual customer had a response against it so surely there could be individual responses for Common Sense Wow do you have shares in Apple? Not sure that you have a basic understanding or even grasp of what competitive behavior is or just general knowledge of business models or even basic economics. The Australian banks now supported by Wesfarmers and Australian Retailers Association are asking for Apple to open up NFC ability to other parties. This actually increases competition and allows consumers greater choice in what digital wallet they can use. Thus being restricted to just using Apple Pay is counter productive to consumer interests and competition in the market place. As a side issue Apple is piggy backing on the banks infrastructure and doesn’t have a right to dictate to Australian banks. To have such a one sided argument begs the question what is the standard like at university of Western Australia. I would suspect that ACCC would rule in favour of Australian banks.

With summer ending, travel brands are already planning for the winter season, each with their eye on maximizing their share of the bumper online travel revenues which the peak season creates. NB: This is a viewpoint from Sean Sewell, co-founder and EMEA business development director, Performance Horizon. The set-up We’ve already seen many interesting developments this year. Google moved beyond being a third-party traffic referrer and entered the distribution space. This bold move, which allows consumers to book travel directly via its Hotel Finder, puts the search giant in direct competition with some of its biggest customers such as Hotels.com and Skyscanner. Likewise, TripAdvisor has evolved beyond being just a travel content site and now allows consumers to read reviews and book all in one place. Most consumers are unaware that they get this seamless experience thanks to something behind the scenes – application programming interfaces (APIs) The solution Specifically, it is booking APIs are changing where and how consumers book travel. Here’s how booking APIs are driving change and how all parties – such as travel brands, digital marketing partners,  publishers and consumers – benefit from an increased investment and integration of online and mobile booking APIs. Also addressed are how travel brands and digital marketing partners are working to overcome booking API challenges. Travel Brands Booking APIs are not new – far from it – so why are travel brands waking up to the potential of using booking APIs to optimize conversions and maximize inventory distribution? First and foremost. it is the rapidly shifting sands of how consumers browse and buy. Most travel brands will tell you the same thing: people research flights and hotels on their phones in the morning and book on desktops later in the day. While mobile experiences are getting better, many brands have not fully developed a streamlined mobile booking process. Mobile is where digital marketing partners – such as Google, TripAdvisor, metasearch and OTAs –  and booking APIs are a perfect match. These partners understand mobile, not necessarily a core competency of a travel brand whose primary focus is putting planes in the air and providing great accommodations for guests. By making their booking APIs available to a  range of online and mobile partners, travel brands can increase market distribution and booking conversions beyond traditional partners, while stemming drop off rates by providing the most seamless customer experiences. Digital Marketing Partners The benefits of booking APIs work both ways. Publishers other than metas, are leveraging booking APIs to both provide their readers with better experiences and boost their own profitability as a digital marketing partner. Today’s consumers move on quickly if they can’t easily find information or a complete a transaction. For publishers large and small, eyeballs and time on site are like physical currency. In order to reduce bounce rate, publishers must provide experiences that enable readers to complete actions from start to finish all without leaving their site. Reader’s Digest opened up travel booking directly from its online properties. This makes sense, as publishers know their readers best. By working with travel brands who have vast amounts of data (past bookings, frequent fliers, first class vs. economy), publishers can drive conversions and increase their revenues by providing readers with the most relevant offers. It’s not all straightforward however. Publishers have many challenges when using booking APIs, especially around credit card transactions, security, and data ownership. Many times, brands will control everything in order to secure customer data. Overcoming challenges In addition to the security issue, booking APIs can come with challenges around formatting and the investment to do so. This is one painpoint IATA’s New Distribution Capability (NDC) hopes to address. As booking APIs evolve and become easier to implement and use, more and more partners will work directly with brands, increasing distribution and potentially reducing the need for more traditional tracking methods via affiliate networks and pure tracking providers. And the technology is there for brands and their digital marketing partner to connect directly and share/track data in real time. To summarize, I think the trend toward booking APIs that’s taken hold this year will set the stage for an exciting era in the travel vertical. Competition will increase as the lines continue to blur between metasearch engines and OTAs, and as Google aggressively expands its direct booking clients. In general, the smartest brands and digital marketing partners will leverage booking APIs to unlock continued growth and profitability.

Photo: Bloomberg New York: It is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days. For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favour. And rivals with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail. Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the US behind Uber, is grappling with those forces—but has found that its options are limited. In recent months, San Francisco-based Lyft has held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. One person said it was Lyft who was approached by interested parties. Lyft’s discussions were most serious with GM, which is one of the ride-hailing company’s largest investors. Still, GM never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer. Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so it will continue as an independent entity. Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own their own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies. Tensions have escalated in the industry in recent months as some ride-hailing companies have worked to figure out what to do with their most expensive operations. This month, Uber, which has raised far more money than Lyft, agreed to sell its Chinese subsidiary to Didi, the biggest ride-hailing company in China. The deal freed Uber from a cash-sucking battle for dominance in the China market. But the move also disrupted a global alliance that Lyft had earlier struck with Didi and others to fight Uber. Lyft has not stated whether it will continue working with Didi, but the dissolution of a partnership could stymie Lyft’s growth prospects. Representatives from Lyft, Google, Amazon, Apple, GM, Didi and Uber declined to comment on talks. Lyft, a 4-year-old company co-founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer, sprung out of an early long-distance carpooling programme, then called Zimride, in 2007. The goal, the two co-founders have said, was to create a new kind of social ride-sharing, an attempt to decrease the number of cars on the road and to improve congestion, reduce humanity’s environmental footprint and create more efficiency in transportation. That idea has turned into a global movement, as companies worldwide—like Grab in South-East Asia, Ola in India, BlaBlaCar in Europe and Uber—look to upend the global transportation infrastructure. The effort to sell Lyft was aided by bankers at Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank founded by the veteran Silicon Valley banker Frank Quattrone, said the people with knowledge of the talks. Qatalyst declined to comment. Lyft failed to find a buyer partly because of cost, the people said. Lyft was valued at $5.5 billion after an investment round by GM and others in January, making it one of the more pre-eminent unicorn companies in Silicon Valley. Any sale would most likely have to fetch a premium from Lyft’s last valuation to be desirable to the company and its investors. Lyft also struggled to find a buyer because of the challenging economics of the ride-hailing business. Companies like Lyft and Uber typically take 20-25% of the cost of each ride. With Lyft drivers expected to pick up an estimated $2 billion or so in fares this year, that meant Lyft’s annual revenue would be about $400 million, according to a person familiar with its financials. That $400 million shrinks after marketing costs are factored in. To win loyalty from drivers who can also work for Uber, Lyft also sometimes lets drivers keep that 20-25% of some rides, so the company effectively earns no revenue in those situations. And in some cases, Lyft provides drivers with additional cash incentives simply to get out on the road, adding to its costs. The economic realities of the industry have set in for a number of ride-hailing players. Sidecar, an app that competed with Uber and Lyft, shut down in December, citing a “significant capital disadvantage” compared with others in the market. “One of the challenges for these firms is to figure out how to grow and sustain that latent demand for these businesses, but also to eventually become profitable,” said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. “Part of the challenge in evolving those services is just balancing out those factors. And that’s not an easy task.” Lyft is not profitable, said a person briefed on the company’s finances. Yet, it has a $1.4 billion cash hoard, the person added, and the company thinks that will shield it as it works towards achieving profitability. Shaheen said an acquisition might still make sense for ride-hailing companies that needed more resources. “There isn’t a single company that has all of this expertise—software, manufacturing, ride-sharing—under one roof,” she said. “That’s where acquisition comes in.” ©2016/THE NEW YORK TIMES David GellesMike Isaac Topics: LyftbuyoutUberAppleGoogle More from this Section Infosys to invest Rs31.6 crore in Stellaris Venture Partners Umang Bedi’s first 100 days at Facebook India Tata Motors calls EGM to remove Mistry, Nusli Wadia as directors Mistry’s comments on proposal to sell TCS to IBM incorrect: F.C.

(screen capture Google streetview) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Temple Israel Cemetery Rockland County New York Some 30 people attended the funeral in New York for a woman they didn’t know. Francine Stein was buried on Wednesday after a graveside funeral at Temple Israel Cemetery in Blauvelt, in Rockland County, New York. The strangers attended the funeral after Ora Weinbach, a New Jersey high school teacher, called on people in a post on Facebook to join her at the service conducted by her father, Rabbi Elchanan Weinbach. The post read: “Huge mitzvah opportunity. A woman is being buried tomorrow who has LITERALLY NO ONE attending her funeral, other than the funeral home director and the rabbi (my father). Who would like to join me at the funeral? I will be leaving Teaneck at 10:45. Free lunch with the rabbi after.” Ora Weinbach said the post was shared by her friends, and then the shares were shared, which led to the turnout at the funeral of the 83-year-old woman less than 24 hours after the original post. The crowd that attended the funeral service also included at least 10 men, enough to form a minyan, or a religious quorum, which enabled the rabbi to recite the Kaddish prayer for the dead. The mourners came from all walks of Jewish life, including an atheist. They also carried Stein’s casket and shoveled dirt into the grave as prescribed by Jewish tradition. Stein lived in an assisted living facility for 10 years, until 2014, after which she was hospitalized while battling cancer, and then entered a nursing home, Gwen Curry, an assistant administrator and case manager at the New Monsey Park assisted living facility, told Inside Edition, which first reported the story. Curry said that while Stein was never married, there were loved ones who would have attended the funeral had they known she died. The rabbi learned at the cemetery that Stein had been a musician and teacher at the Juilliard School. Ora Weinbach later told The Journal News that the fact that “all the people who showed up took time out of their day” was powerful. “I did nothing. I literally just wrote a Facebook post,” she said. “The people who came out in the middle of a random day, those are the people who did a lot. It was amazing.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Temple Israel Cemetery,  Rockland County,  New York,  Teaneck More in Jewish Times Peru's half-Jewish president conducts Israel's Philharmonic in Lima Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments The Times of Israel Current top stories A-G orders police to look into German submarine affair By Times of Israel staff   Report: PM’s lawyer spoke to government figures on behalf of German firm Netanyahu defends his attorney in submarines affair: ‘Straight as an arrow’ Fiddling with fires while a scandal burns IDF chief rabbi-designate: ‘I never wrote, said or thought soldiers can rape’ By Times of Israel staff   Netanyahu says arson suspected as wildfires rage across Israel By Raphael Ahren and Times of Israel staff   Concentration camp uniform turns up at NY yard sale By Frank Eltman   After meeting Trump team, Bennett sees opportunity to change two-state paradigm By Raphael Ahren   The Times of Israel Daily Edition Free to Your Inbox The email is either missing or invalid Almost finished...

Cherrayil, Staff Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: Google has rolled out its person-to-person video calling app — Duo — in the UAE app stores, but many people think it is only a matter of days before it is blocked. “As per the policy in UAE, video calling over mobile network is blocked. So, any new app is likely to get blocked eventually,” Sukhdev Singh, vice-president at market research and analysis services provider AMRB, told Gulf News. The UAE’s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) has already blocked video and voice calling features from BlackBerry, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype and Snapchat. Apple’s FaceTime is not installed by default on the company’s smartphones shipped into the Middle East, but FaceTime works in the UAE with devices bought from Europe or in the US. The Duo app, which works on Android and Apple operating systems, was released in the US last week. The app comes with end-to-end encryption and also has a feature called “Knock Knock” which lets the caller know who is calling. Like FaceTime, Duo only requires a person’s phone number to connect. Many other services require both participants to have accounts to use the video calling options. Many residents have told Gulf News they were using overseas accounts to download Duo, which was launched on Tuesday, assuming it was going to be blocked by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). According to TRA rules, only licensed telecom operators can offer VoIP (voice over internet protocol) in the UAE. Permission Even though VoIP calls by anyone other than a local telecom are officially banned, the use of VoIP to make cheap voice calls over the internet is rampant in the Gulf. Some residents are speculating that Google would not have released Duo without seeking permission from the TRA. If the TRA is now allowing these apps, players such as Apple and Facebook may also seek to unblock their own FaceTime and WhatsApp calling apps respectively. Neither the TRA nor Google could be reach for comment before deadline. “This is obviously something that consumers, in particular the expat residents, would love to have as it will bring down their international calling expense substantially,” Singh said. “It is high time for TRA to look into this when rest of the world is open to video and voice calling apps. One good option is to offer residents a monthly fee to access these apps and, at the same time, telecom operators can also benefit from the data usage,” he said.

TECHNOLOGY Meet the Airbnb of 3-D Printing Fictiv makes it easy for hardware entrepreneurs to order and receive prototype parts by connecting them to a network of 3-D printers and manufacturing machinery. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times.

He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT Dave Evans, left, and brother Nate Evans are the founders behind Fictiv, a San Francisco startup that connects entrepreneurs to a network of manufacturing machinery they can use to order prototype parts. CREDIT: Fictiv Advertisement Periodically, Dave Evans, Nate Evans, and their team gather around a tall wooden table to painstakingly dismantle mechanical devices such as smartwatches, air-quality monitors, GoPro cameras, and more. Under a bright studio lamp, they snap photos of each and every part. This gadget surgery team's operation is a critical part of the marketing for Fictiv, the Evans's three-year-old startup, which gives entrepreneurs access to a network of hundreds of 3-D printing and manufacturing machines that can be used to create parts for product prototypes. The 25-person San Francisco-based company puts together blog posts of these teardowns to show others how products are made. The strategy is simple: Teach creative types how to make hardware products and inspire them to build their own, preferably by ordering the parts from Fictiv. "What I care about and what I find so inspiring is the creative potential of humans, and if you can enable those people to seek their own ambitions or their own goals through tools--that's what drives me every day," says Nate. Fictiv aims to enable more entrepreneurs to launch hardware startups by lowering the costs of product development. The founders say the company has demonstrated enough traction to secure $10 million in investments. Its chief investor is Accel Partners, which led the company's seed financing and its Series A round late last year. While software companies have access to a variety of tools that make their development cycles quick, hardware companies are stuck in the stone age, says Accel's Sameer Gandhi. There "was clearly an opportunity," says Gandhi, who has worked with hardware companies in the past. "The value of that efficiency, of making companies more innovative, it's tremendous." The founders declined to comment on how many orders the company has processed, but its approach has brought in customers including enterprises like Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley research wing, which uses Fictiv whenever its own machines are over capacity. "What interested me in Fictiv is the fact that they're not using their own prototype machine but a network of prototype machines," says Rasheq Zarif, senior manager of business innovation at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America. "And that opens a whole slew of opportunities." A machinery network In a sense, Fictiv is the Airbnb of manufacturing. Just as property owners rent their spare rooms on Airbnb, shop owners lend their idle machinery to Fictiv. Entrepreneurs submit a digital file of the part they need on Fictiv's website and receive a quote based on the company's algorithm, which analyzes factors such as the amount of material and time required. Because of the volume of orders across its network, the company says, it can offer lower prices than if customers went to machine operators directly. The part arrives a few days later in a cardboard package branded with big, bold letters that spell "Fictiv." (The name is a play on the word "fictive," meaning "creating or created by imagination.") By quickly identifying the shops and machines best suited for each job and intelligently routing orders, Fictiv can offer a far shorter turnaround time than that of traditional manufacturers. The service is designed for low-volume prototype manufacturing but it is capable of handling large orders for thousands of parts. For techies like Will Rehlich, Fictiv's quick approach is critical to the innovative process. "It's reduced our design cycle times from months to a couple weeks, if not a week," says Rehlich, who uses Fictiv to order parts for prototypes he makes at Nexkey, a Silicon Valley startup that makes a smart electronic key lock. Fictiv's cut of each project varies depending on its complexity, the chosen material, and the machine that is used, but the bulk of each sale goes to the startup's manufacturing partners, just as Airbnb gives most of its sales to its hosts. Couriers are paid a flat fee to deliver the parts around the Bay Area, while nationwide shipments are made via FedEx or UPS. And just as Airbnb vets its hosts, Fictiv ensures its partners meet its standards. "We go to extreme lengths," says Nate, explaining that Fictiv has a team that is constantly asking partners questions and ordering test parts to ensure consistent quality. Fictiv has primarily used 3-D printers to create parts from a variety of plastics. In June, though, the company introduced a computer numerical control (CNC) option that lets customers order parts made from more types of materials, including aluminum and stainless steel. "It allows people to produce really complex parts in a very seamless fashion in three days, which is just unheard of," Nate says. Fictiv delivers its parts in brand-packages to ensure customers feel they receive the "Fictiv experience." CREDIT: Fictiv Democratizing hardware development The idea for Fictiv came to the Evans brothers after they graduated from Stanford earlier this decade. Nate was working as a startup adviser for a boutique investment banking firm, which he says gave him a macro-level perspective of Silicon Valley. He was able to study specific markets like advertising, where he observed that ad-tech companies use automated networks of websites and advertisers to ensure all ad space is sold. Dave, meanwhile, was working as a hardware engineer at Ford's Silicon Valley Lab and frustratingly waiting weeks for parts. He also saw that many of his peers owned machines that went largely unused. He took these frustrations to his older brother. The two began to see an opportunity. "Nate recognized the patterns that were happening in the ad-tech world with what we were seeing with machine capacity and availability," says Dave, Fictiv's CEO. "If we could just leverage these idle machines, it'd be better." The brothers, who grew up playing basketball together, teamed up. They spent $3,000 on a MakerBot Replicator 2 and made a promise to each other: If they could get the 3-D printer to pay for itself in one month by completing orders, they would quit their jobs. After handing out business cards at Maker Faire (an event for DIY-ers), tapping into their network of hardware engineers, filling orders in Dave's kitchen, and driving around town on Dave's bright red scooter delivering parts, the pair met their goal. They held each other to the promise and put in their notice. The brothers each anted up $5,000 to start Fictiv. The plan was to do the printing themselves for Fictiv's first three months in an effort to stress test their idea before raising any capital. Over the next few months, they began partnering with vendors and working out Fictiv's kinks. Dave focused on the tech and engineering while Nate focused on design and business. As they went along, they found there were three pillars to manufacturing: quality, speed, and price. To stand out, they needed to excel in two of them. Both brothers wanted quality, and after a year, it became clear that Fictiv's customers were willing to pay up for rapid turnarounds. Nate and Dave placed their focus on speed, doing everything they could to cut out inefficiencies. On their website, they made it possible for customers to quickly place orders. On the manufacturing side, they kept adding more partners to increase capacity. The effort paid off, and they began seeing some customers order up to three times per week. "We had real companies building real products saying that Fictiv was their unfair competitive advantage," Dave says. "That was when the light bulb really went off." To grow, the Evans brothers have built a community of hardware engineers, holding meetups and producing blog posts like their teardowns. In July, the company released a vast Hardware Guide for free. It is intended to essentially open-source prototyping strategies so that anyone who is interested in creating gadgets has a trove of information at his or her disposal. In software, this type of knowledge has long been readily available. Not so for hardware. "When you're giving a platform for all those innovators to really have conversations to learn from each other, that creates more value than we can capture," Dave says. While Fictiv is off to a great start, many challenges await. Over the next few months, the team will have to build out its CNC offering and bring it to the level of quality customers have grown to expect from its 3-D printing option. It also must continue to expand geographically. Although the company has built a strong network of vendors in the Bay Area that can deliver parts within day or hours, it has yet to bring that kind of immediacy to other parts of the country. That leaves the young tech startup exposed to the threat of copycats in other markets. For now though, the startup plans to continue its focus on Silicon Valley, the home of thousands of hardware entrepreneurs and the tech capital of the world, and slowly build out from there. "The vision is to democratize hardware development," Dave says. Published on: Aug 17, 2016 Advertisement

According to a pre-release review by Mashable, the app is both lean and very sturdy – they claim it works on any network down to 2G service. The user interface is almost nonexistent (in a good way), with no bells and whistles to confuse you or to accidentally hit mid-call.   WHAT’S TRENDY. If there was one trend that took Summer 2016 by storm, it was the off-the-shoulder style. Looking forward to fall, that’s a trend that isn’t impossible to take to cooler months, but I think we’ll see a different iteration of the romantic, flowy vibe in bell-sleeve everything. Whether it’s a gathered baby bell sleeve that begins at the wrist, or a full-on Renaissance look, I expect to see this everywhere (and you already can see it plenty of places!). Zara has a shiny boatneck top that uses both glitter and an understated baby bell sleeve to carry this trend, as well as a beautiful cream-colored sweater that uses both bows and bell sleeves to create a very girly look.   WHAT’S AFFORDABLE. The Augusta-Richmond County Library system is hopping onboard the Pokemon Go trend, hosting a Pokemon Go meetup on Friday, Aug. 26, at the downtown branch. At the event, Pokemon Go fans will be able to watch old episodes of the original show, enjoy food and drink, and meet fellow fans of the game and show. Additionally, Lure Modules will be in effect during the entire event. It starts at 3 p.m. and is free and open to all ages.

X How to . . . increase storage on your Android phone If your mobile isn’t able to store all your photos, video and music you can remedy that Sun, Aug 21, 2016, 06:00 Updated: Sun, Aug 21, 2016, 16:51 Ciara O'Brien Android smartphone: adding a memory card and storing in the cloud are just some ways to increase capacity. Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP Photo         It’s a common complaint: nice phone, shame about the storage. Particularly at the budget end of the Android market, you may find that your phone storage just isn’t up to scratch when it comes to coping with the photos, video and music you are trying to store on it. But there are way to improve your lot: here are a few tips : Add a bit Okay, so it’s not quite making the most of what you’ve got, but it’s the easiest way to sort your storage problem. If your phone accepts external storage, buy a micro SD memory card for it. That will give you an instant boost, and it’s a relatively cheap method of expanding your phone’s capacity. Before you invest in a massive memory card though check your phone’s information for the highest capacity memory card it will accept. Some older phones will only support cards up 32GB. There are other options – using external devices or wireless drives – but part of the problem with relying on a memory card is that not all apps can be transferred to it. Some phones running Android 6.0 take the memory card and make it part of the system’s overall storage. It’s known as adoptable storage, and it means you can’t remove the card and use it in another device without formatting it, but it will be a cheap way to expand storage. You’ll need a card with a decent read/write speed too. Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing Instagram takes on Snapchat with live, ‘disappearing’ video How to . . . help out your smartphone battery Delete unwanted apps Those apps that you downloaded because they seemed interesting, but you rarely – if ever – use? Get rid. They may not be huge, but the cumulative effect can put a dent in your device storage. If you change your mind, you can always re-download them from the Google Play store, free of charge. ADVERTISEMENT Clear app caches Over time, your lean apps can collect data and swell to gargantuan proportions. There are two ways to clear app caches in Android. You can do it individually for each app, although how you do it will depend on the version of Android your phone is running. Generally, if you go to Settings>Apps, you’ll find a list of your installed apps. Choose the app, and you’ll be brought to a screen where you can force the app to stop, uninstall it, and see exactly how much space it is taking up on your phone. Under Storage, there’s usually an option to delete data and delete the cache. You’ll have to do this individually, unless you don’t mind losing information from all your apps. In that case, you can put your phone into recovery mode and clear the app information that way. It differs from phone model to model, but a quick Google search will usually turn up the instructions. Delete your downloads The same goes for downloads. Every time you download a file to your device, it takes up space. Go to your App screen, select Downloads and you will see a list of what is lurking.You can delete them individually from there, saving the files you need. Use the cloud It’s nice to have your photos at your fingertips, but do you really need to store all of them on the phone? If you use Google Photos to automatically back up your images, you’ll have a slightly lower resolution, but still usable, version on your Google account. That means you don’t have to store everything on the phone. Set Google Photos to automatically backup your images by going to the Photos app – you can download it from the Play store if it is not available on your handset – and accepting the prompt to backup and sync that will appear when you first open the app. If you rejected that option initially, you can always turn it on by opening the app, choosing Settings, and checking the Back up and Sync option. If you don’t want to use the free storage option from Google, you can always try Dropbox. You get 2GB free of charge, and you can set your images to automatically upload to your account directly from your phone. Media files It’s not just photos and videos that are space hogs. Music can also eat into your phone storage, and not just the files you transfer yourself. If you have streaming services such as Spotify or Deezer, and you opt to make your music available offline, the app will download and store the data it needs to give you access to tracks without an internet connection. That can add up. Clearing the app’s data though will mean you lose access to your offline tracks, so you need to balance convenience with your desire for more storage.

Blog Posts What Golang Is and Is Not Wed Aug 17, 2016 We are all products of our own histories, and I suspect many routes to Go have been made less enjoyable by misguided expectations. The journey from when a budding developer first ‘hello worlded’ to now may have made Go’s more subtle strengths less obvious to them. Go is least of all about the language in and of itself, but rather about the broader things affected by it, more so than other languages I have used over the years. Many recent arrivals to Go have preconceptions that have been proved wrong and caused disappointment, this appears to happen most often when looking from a more purist computer science based language design point of view. Go is an engineering tool, in a much broader sense. To appreciate it properly I think you have to have spent a decent amount of time responsible for the full lifecycle. If all you ever do is write and commit code then much of Go will be lost on you. The Go Hype, or Not. I have heard more than once that people have been disappointed by go given the hype surrounding it. I don’t remember anything really hype like 5 years ago when go was in its infancy, and I must say that I am not really aware of anything specific now. Of course any new language that is becoming better adopted, in particular as quickly as Go, will naturally attract attention. There are articles out there that sing Go’s praises, perhaps a little too highly, but I don’t remember many of them explicitly making any claims about the language itself being the reason why Go is so good. Go is Not An Innovative Language “Innovative” is such an overused and abused word that it has lost a lot of power and meaning. All innovation is contextual and to use the word without context is foolhardy. In the context of language design Go was never an innovative language, nor was it presented as such, or anyone dishonest in representing it that way. As a language Go was always explicitly a return to simplicity, and in many ways naivety, for sound reasons. “There is nothing new under the sun” rings true in all languages since the 80’s. Virtually everything we see in language design now that someone says is “innovative” has been explored in some form before. Go is certainly no exception, but remember it never claimed to be state of the art. Regarding the language being youthful, of course it is, but the intention is not for the language itself to ‘mature’: no more complexity is going to be added, or at least it’s very unlikely. It is not ‘missing’ comprehensions, or inheritance, or generics, they are omitted (and I pray, always will be). In some way, in the context of the current fashion of returning to more functional languages, or the evolution of good old languages to include more functional paradigms (I’m looking at you Javascript and Python for two examples) then in a tenuous convoluted way Go has ‘innovated’ by avoiding that trend. Go is an Innovative Thing It is hard to define what the ‘thing’ is, but it is quite a broad thing, I can’t fully say it is an approach, or a belief, or even ‘patterns and practices’, though that last phrase feels closest. This is still about the best read on the subject: Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering Possibly Go’s greatest ‘innovation’ is to eschew making software engineering an overly academic process in daily practice, and to focus on improving the tools, speed, reliability and pure pleasure in delivering and running things of value. Thats not to say that Go encourages you hack away without a sound foundation, quite the opposite, I think Go almost requires you to have a good grasp of the fundamentals, to be an effective Go programmer. I would say that the simplicity and imperative style that Go encourages, tends to demand a greater underlying computer science knowledge than many other languages may expect. Having recently watched Mind the Gap (GopherCon 2016) I think Katrina Owen echo’s this belief. Unifying I think one reasonable way of categorising all the things that make up delivering software products is into: human, operational and technology factors, in that order of value. Go helps address some problems in all three areas but it is its influence over human and operational factors where it sets itself apart from other systems. Even as technologists we can’t help moving things into the ‘human’ domains such as emotion and personalisation, most compilers don’t care about many of the things humans care about, but the language naturally becomes a very human thing. Go has learned from the experience of fractured communities and continual in-fighting amongst teams and has attempted to avoid debates that continue to rage in other languages that are 20+ years old. The early focus on idioms helped that. This approach comes from years of experience delivering in teams at scale, where the language is one small factor, which has caused an inappropriate amount of time wasted on a tiny fraction of the whole value. As an example: curly brace positioning is one of the most trivial things possible, and yet still many hours are wasted on it. Paradox of Choice In all languages there are always some basic primitives and data types that relate closely to the machine instruction set, which in turns map well to the hardware (see Note 1.) Ultimately all other higher order data structures in all languages are composed of arrays, references, and structs. Trees, heaps, sets, queues and everything else effectively only manipulate arrays of structs/primitives or self referencing structs, thats it, simple, or it should be. In the Go language at its heart that simplicity is encouraged, we are only offered some basics. To start with we are given primitives, structs and arrays, then because it is unavoidably useful we have a dynamic array, a Slice which is an embellished array to allow dynamic resizing. Finally, in certain problem domains the power and flexibility of a hash-map is also unavoidable, therefore Go provides a Map built in. These are given some special treatment, simply because it is very useful and they are special, (providing the same treatment to function returns would add low value complexity) There is a subtlety to providing only this subset. The fact they map well to lower layers imbues an immediate sense of being more intimate with the CPU, which certainly for ‘older’ engineers feels refreshing, and at a minimum for younger engineers tends to influence design decisions towards simplicity. Having said that the desire to construct complex implementations of data structures - even if used only once - is ever present when a new arrival to Go finds their favourite container is ‘missing’. To provide any solution in Go that needs a dynamic data structure you can choose between hand rolled linked structures or a Slice or Map (or compose with them). As they are quite different the choice is normally obvious. Contrast this to the choice between map, set, hashset, bag etc etc, or rolling your own in a language that makes this a lot harder. Often the author actually only uses a subset of the functionality of those data structures. In these cases the choice becomes much less simple, indeed often a point of confusion and contention and can be the cause of further low-value conversations. A Go programmer takes a slice or map and mixes in a few functions to provide the structure they need. For example The Go standard library has provided a minimal container package with a heap (which is just an interface), a list (doubly linked), and a ring (which is a closed doubly linked list). To implement a heap - you need to provide a builtin to implement the storage with an array being the typical choice. Each one of those packages has no more than around 200 lines of code. Those few lines of code are very readable, the behaviour understandable, and the performance predictable; being a function of the performance of the well understood builtin and the users own implementation code. This removal of choice and focus on reusing the two builtins, drives a readability, clarity and consistency amongst Go programmers, not afforded in other languages. In other languages an iterator (one of the often complained about omissions) necessarily abstracts that which is being contained, and often insists on a broad interface some of which then remains unused, and adds some cognitive load, sometimes unnecessarily. Not providing an iterator and not providing many containers implementing iterable, or whatever other system, avoids needing a whole swathe of knowledge, indirection, discussion and misunderstanding, at little practical cost. The effect of the omission in real world code results in minimal extra work at code creation time, for great gains in the rest of the lifecycle. Custom data structures can be composed from the well understood builtins, rolled in under 100 lines of code and can can exist close to the place they are used (yes repeated!). The effect of this approach on readability, maintainability, decoupling, removing seemingly endless low value conversations, and when push comes to shove the ability to understand performance characteristics and then tune them, adds so much more value to the whole lifecycle, than the cost of the omission. These are subtle yet important factors that attempt to address some of the human and operational complications. More Than a Language Without going into all of the things that the Go ecosystem brings to the table on top of the language design, what should be clear from a shallow familiarity with the tooling is that Go has focussed on providing answers to some of the more difficult aspects of actually getting code that is both stable and agile into production. These things that were part of Go from the beginning have had to evolve over decades in other languages, often in fractured directions - again adding the paradox of choice. For example Go’s dependency management attempts to solve a thorny problem, and while go get in particular is going through some teething pains, its inclusion from day one is illustrative of Go’s intention. It is this focus on the operational aspects of development, so early on in Go’s evolution that emphasises the reason Go was created, and is commonly overlooked in favour of low value critiques of the language itself. Note 1. In our Von Neumann / Harvard world we have basically three hardwired data structures, a register, a stack, and addressable memory, these are mapped via the instruction set to: register operations; effectively push and pop, moving data to and from memory addresses, and in CISC’s contiguous memory operations, even in RISC’s loop primitives are optimised for contiguous ranges. Ultimately these in turn map through compilers to value variables (which indirect the decision to use registers, the stack, or an addressable value), and reference variables, which contain the value of an address of the value, and slightly higher up the conceptual scale: arrays. Compilers also compose these fundamental variables into primitive data types: ints, floats, and arrays into strings etc. Finally, also through well managed contiguous memory, namely ‘packing’, common primitives are grouped into ‘structs’. There are subtle variations on these themes, particularly with respect to structs or objects, involving further indirection (think v-tables etc), but that is the crux of it.   « Previous: The Cult of Go Test Next:   The Test Pyramid and Availability Bias » Categories: golang go tech testing development engineering quality Home Page Blog Index CV

At its luxury brand Audi, however, eyes are firmly on the stars. The marque that gained worldwide fame with its all-conquering Audi Quattro World Rally Championship car in the first half of the 1980s aims to win a global competition even its veteran champ Hannu Mikkola might baulk at – by rallying on the moon. The Audi Lunar quattro moon rover has recently been tested in the Qatari desert as part of the preparations for its mission to travel to our nearest solar-system neighbour and win the US$25 million Google Lunar XPRIZE competition in 2017. The German engineers are working with a group called the Part-Time Scientists (PTS), formed in Berlin specifically to challenge for the prize and develop commercial space technology. Leading the challenge is Jack Crenshaw who was responsible for the trajectory calculations of the Nasa Apollo programme in the 1960s and 1970s. PTS is offering paying customers the chance to have something taken to the moon. These objects can be either of personal, commercial or technological value, it says. In each case individuals, organisations or companies can buy "payload" to bring their desired object to the moon. The rpices range from €800 per kilogram - from 0.5kg to 0.99kg – for a "small" object to €700 per kg for a large object weighing from 2kg and over, according to its website. The team chose Qatar as the desert terrain resembles the environment on the moon. This is the first time that the rover has had its capabilities practically tested in extreme hot climate conditions. To win the competition, a team – which must be at least 90 per cent privately financed – needs to transport an automated vehicle to the moon, which must then drive at least 500 metres on the surface and transmit high-resolution images and video footage back to Earth. In addition, the lunar vehicle must launch into space by the end of 2017 to cover the 380,000km to the moon. The trip takes five days and – according to estimates by the Audi PTS team – will cost about €24m (Dh99.8m). While that poses a commercial question – surely the attempt will lose money win or lose? – other competitors are confident it will be worth while. Moon Express, a US outfit that this month became the first to receive the US government’s greenlight for its planned Google prize moonshot, says flights to the moon can be profitable even if a company does not win the prize money. "The marginal cost of a trip is now under $10m," said the chairman and co-founder Naveen Jain. "Things that did not make sense when the cost of a trip was $1 billion are wildly profitable when it costs $10m." Moon Express said it already has paying customers for its first moon launch, which will deliver a telescope as well as the ashes of some people who want to be buried on the moon. For the Audi quattro team, the target landing zone is north of the moon’s equator, close to the 1972 landing site of Nasa’s last manned mission to the moon, Apollo 17. In this region, temperatures fluctuate by an enormous 300°C; when the sun is shining, it gets up to 120°C due to the lack of an atmosphere, and at night the temperature plummets for the same reason. Many of the rover’s components are made of high-strength aluminium and it weighs 35 kilograms. That will be further reduced by the use of magnesium and design modifications, even though the vehicle might become somewhat smaller in size. A swivelling solar panel captures sunlight, and the electricity it generates is fed to a lithium-ion battery that powers the four wheel-hub motors. All four of the wheels can be rotated 360 degrees. The theoretical maximum speed is 3.6kph – but more important on the rugged surface of the moon are the vehicle’s off-road qualities and safe navigating abilities. Two stereo cameras that acquire detailed 3D images are mounted to a moving head at the front of the vehicle. A third camera is used to study materials, and it generates extremely high-resolution panoramic images. The Audi team assisting the Part-Time Scientists have, in addition to their lightweight design competence, expertise on the quattro permanent all-wheel drive system and the electrical e-tron drive system. The goal here is to further enhance performance by making additional improvements to the electric motors, power electronics and battery, they say. Mr Jain said his first probe will not return to Earth, but that the second trip will be its first round-trip flight. He added that once return trips are standard, lunar flights will have lots of business applications. And, he predicts, private flights will soon transport people to the moon and back. "If I was a betting man, I’d say it’ll be sometime between 10 and 15 years," he said. chnelson@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Space battle of the billionaires hots up as Bezos rocket test succeeds India sucessfully launches mini space shuttle Elon Musk’s Space X launches reusable rocket revolution SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch - video More Technology #UAEinnovators: 3D printing a tech advance in cardiac surgery at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi BlackBerry Dtek60 review: Phone maker returns to the fray #UAEinnovators: New social shopping app from Emirati siblings that developed Yebab Facebook rejects Brexit doom-mongers to boost UK workforce by 50 per cent MOST VIEWED Business | All Abu Dhabi Airports all geared up for F1 fans deluge Can Dubai property owner terminate deal with real estate agency for not fulfilling duties?

The growing market, targeted by Chinese players such as Huawei, Alibaba and Baidu, has raised serious questions about security of data storage and whether tech firms in China or elsewhere are vulnerable to attack. China last week took a major step towards resolving the cyber security challenge by launching the world’s first "hack-proof" quantum satellite. "The satellite’s two-year mission will be to develop ‘hack-proof’ quantum communications, allowing users to send messages securely," Xinhua news agency reported. The Quantum Experiments at Space Scale, or Quess, satellite programme is part of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s space programme. "There’s been a race to produce a quantum satellite, and it is very likely that China is going to win that race," Nicolas Gisin, a professor and quantum physicist at the University of Geneva, told The Wall Street Journal. "It shows again China’s ability to commit to large and ambitious projects and to realise them." The satellite is designed to secure messages between Beijing and Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, a sprawling region of deserts and snow-capped mountains in China’s extreme west. The technology is extremely complex and based on the scientific principle of quantum entanglement. According to this theory, two particles become "entangled" when they interact. However, any subsequent interaction with one impacts, instantaneously and regardless of distances between them, on both particles. "It is hence impossible to wiretap, intercept or crack the information transmitted through it," Xinhua reported after Tuesday’s launch. But there are concerns about who has the keys to such technological developments and whether sensitive – or mission critical – data could be at risk in the absence of international rules and controls. "There is a global focus on who controls data. But there is no transparency in this business," Sheila Jasanoff, director, programme on science, technology and society at Harvard Kennedy School tells The National. "A new kind of frontier has been opened up, and it does not have any rules," she says. There has been a proliferation of companies in the cloud computing sector, where sensitive or critical data is stored outside an organisation’s physical boundary, and very little commitment to data security, she adds. The world market for cloud solutions is expanding rapidly. Global spending on cloud services is expected to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.4 per cent between 2015 and 2019, according to the statistics analyst, Statista. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud arm of Amazon, generated revenues of US$7.88 billion in 2015, it says. But the biggest hurdle for the sector is cyber security in the absence of any international treaty to enshrine it. Cloud companies offer an extensive array of often expensive software solutions "to rent" to clients unable or unwilling to make the extremely heavy investment in money and expertise required to build such systems. As the sector expands, the leasing companies are increasingly focusing on safety in a bid to convince customers to move to cloud. "Data security is an issue everywhere and, as [customers] move from internal IT networks largely based on computers and software located inside their own facilities to a cloud model in which the firm’s employees can use cheap mobile devices to access their IT network anywhere in the world at any time, the threats to data security grow," says Lee Branstetter, an associate professor of economics at the Heinz School of Policy and Management of the Carnegie Mellon University. "But the shift to cloud computing will only succeed if firms believe their essential data to be reasonably secure. "For this reason, major players are making very large investments in technology that can ensure reasonably secure access to IT networks," he says. At present, customers of cloud services have to contend with security safeguards which are "extremely opaque", Ms Jasanoff says. "Cloud computing is still an unruly territory. People [in the business] are making rules as they go along or taking advantage of the lack of rules." Ms Jasanoff adds that should a mission critical system such as a public health or transport network be hacked by terrorists, for example, the results could be catastrophic. "I would think a big tragedy might happen in a large airport or other facility like a hospital system and it would result in loss of life," she says. Meanwhile, Chinese cloud vendors are not just tapping domestic business but also trying to extend their reach globally by establishing cloud infrastructure such as data centres in different countries. A Chinese company called Beijing Sinnet Technology recently tied up with Amazon to provide cloud services in China, while several others are looking for similar deals. Beijing hopes that the launch of the quantum satellite will give China a first-mover advantage and make it possible for Chinese cloud vendors to assure their customers about data security, at least from the technology point of view. "It is a noble and difficult endeavour and I applaud the Chinese Academy of Sciences for its vision," says Spyridon Michalakis, a quantum scientist from the California Institute of Technology. The launch also has the potential to "transform the face of cloud-based computing and even science as we know it", he adds. But technological advances alone are not enough. The long history of intellectual property rights violations in China makes it more difficult for Chinese cloud vendors to convince international customers about the ability to keep data secure from predators – or from the eyes of the state. "Many multinationals have serious concerns about the protection of their intellectual property in China on and off line, and there have been a number of recent cases of international firms coming to believe that valuable information has been stolen from them through cyber means," Mr Branstetter says. "All of this would give non-Chinese multinationals pause before entrusting their critical data to Chinese cloud computing service providers." One domestic advantage that Chinese companies have is that state regulations mean foreign companies cannot operate on an equal footing with them. Foreign cloud vendors can operate in China only if they have local partners – and use servers located in the country. That has left the field more or less clear for homegrown cloud vendors, who are able to tap major business opportunities without facing severe competition from international players. And it may be that few Chinese companies are too concerned about the challenge of luring overseas clients anyway considering in excess of 20 per cent of the Fortune 500 companies are of Chinese origin. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Hacker cash theft from 20,000 Tesco Bank customers adds to UK security concerns World’s largest radio telescope begins operations in China Shortage of security professionals hindering UAE’s cyber crime fight UAE companies ‘wide open’ to cyber attacks due to lack of staff training More Technology BlackBerry Dtek60 review: Phone maker returns to the fray #UAEinnovators: New social shopping app from Emirati siblings that developed Yebab Facebook rejects Brexit doom-mongers to boost UK workforce by 50 per cent Chinese smartphone makers buck trend among rivals of falling sales MOST VIEWED Business | All Can Dubai property owner terminate deal with real estate agency for not fulfilling duties?

In 2015, the US Constitution helped Backpage dodge a lawsuit from victims of sex trafficking. What's more, a federal judge invoked the First Amendment and crucified an Illinois sheriff—who labeled Backpage a "sex trafficking industry profiteer"—because the sheriff coerced Visa and Mastercard to refrain from processing payments to the site. The judge said Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart's anti-Backpage lobbying amounted to "an informal extralegal prior restraint of speech" because Dart's actions were threatening the site's financial survival. But the legal troubles didn't end there for Backpage, which The New York Times had labeled "the leading site for trafficking of women and girls in the United States." Thirteen months ago, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which is examining sex trafficking on the Internet, subpoenaed (PDF) Carl Ferrer, Backpage's chief executive officer. But Ferrer, citing the First Amendment, has largely refused to comply with the subpoena—which essentially demands to know everything about the company's business model and profits, including how it screens ads. That screening aspect of the subpoena are similar to the one Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood issued to Google about its polices of policing third-party content. In July, however, Hood and Google settled their dispute about the subpoena, which read like a page from the anti-piracy playbook of the Motion Picture Association of America. Meanwhile, in the Backpage brouhaha, one part of the 13-page Congressional subpoena requires Backpage to disclose "All documents relating to the use of a Tor browser, or any other anonymizing Internet browser on the Onion Network, to post advertisements on Backpage." Other requirements include annual revenue, annual profits, and, among other things, "All documents" related to "Traffic directed to or from Adult Sections of Backpage's US-based websites," and "All documents relating to processing of payment and fees associated with posting advertisements." Because of Ferrer's refusal to comply, the Senate in March unanimously approved its first contempt resolution in more than 20 years. Bolstered by horror stories of young girls saying they were sold for sex on the site, Senate lawmakers contended Backpage supports a flourishing market for sex-trafficking advertisements. When the Senate voted for contempt, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said the authorities had found a missing girl via a "sex advertisement" on Backpage that contained a missing child poster of the child and a topless photo of her. "We'd certainly like to know what supposedly market-leading screening and moderation procedures missed that one," Portman said from the Senate floor. After the unanimous vote and because of the site's resistance, the Senate asked a judge (PDF) to demand that Backpage comply. US District Judge Rosemary Collyer sided (PDF) with the government on August 5, ruling that Backpage had "no legal or factual support" for its position that the site was protected by the First Amendment. "The Constitution authorizes Congress to investigate any issue or subject about which it can enact legislation to the extent that it 'would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit,'" Judge Collyer ruled. Backpage appealed, asking the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to immediately block the order. "The District Court was dismissive of Backpage.com’s First Amendment concerns because they did not fall into familiar areas in which this Subcommittee or other legislative bodies historically abused authority—including efforts to root out subversives, political dissidents, or civil rights agitators," Ferrer's lawyers wrote. (PDF) "But the decision overlooked the way broad and punitive investigatory demands increasingly are used in the online context to exert pressure on speakers and publishers of third-party content." A week after Collyer's ruling, the appeals court tentatively blocked the order—without deciding the merits. "The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the motion," the court wrote. The appeals panel ordered the government to reply by Friday. In its response, the government demanded that the court lift its stay. The authorities said any First Amendment rights Backpage has are secondary to the government's investigation into human trafficking on the Internet. The Subcommittee is investigating the serious problem of human trafficking on the Internet—much of which takes place on Backpage's website—and has subpoenaed Mr. Ferrer for documents relating to Backpage's screening for illegal trafficking. It is important for the Subcommittee's investigation of Internet sex trafficking to understand what methods the leading online marketplace for sex advertisements employs to screen out illegal sex trafficking on its website. Mr. Ferrer has no First Amendment right to ignore a subpoena for documents about Backpage's business practices related to that topic. He has refused to identify his First Amendment interests except in sweeping generalities and failed even to attempt to show that any such interests outweigh important governmental interests served by the Subcommittee's investigation. Indeed, Mr. Ferrer cannot make any balancing argument because he refused to search for responsive documents or produce a privilege log describing them, claiming that the First Amendment gave him blanket immunity from having to carry out these basic duties of all subpoena respondents. The appeals court ordered Backpage to respond by Wednesday. No hearing date has been set. Expand full story Reader comments 139 You must login or create an account to comment.

Major tech and wireless carrier giants such as Apple, Google and AT&T have decided to join forces with the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to stamp down obnoxious automated telemarketing calls, also known as robocalls. Yesterday, the first meeting of FCC’s “Robocall Strike Force” was held in Washington. Approximately 33 well-known firms joined the discussion to regulate and resolve this problem. "The fact that we are all here speaks to the breadth and complexity of the robocall problem," AT&T’s CEO, Randall Stephenson said during the meeting on Friday. "Robocallers are a formidable adversary, notoriously hard to stop. And technology, such as spoofing, makes it easier for them to work around our various fixes and hide their tracks." Last month, chairman of FCC, Tom Wheeler sent letters to all the tech giants and urged them to help in resolving this issue. AT&T was the first company to respond to Mr. Wheeler’s request. Its CEO, Randall Stephenson, is leading the group which hopes to come up with concrete plans to develop new tools to shield users from such calls. The consortium is expected to develop a new caller ID verification system that will automatically block calls from fake numbers. “In parallel with technological solutions, we need our regulatory and law enforcement agencies to go after the bad actors,” AT&T’s CEO Mr. Stephenson wrote on a blog post about the new group on Friday. “Shutting down the bad guys is a necessary step, and a powerful example to others.” Mr. Stephenson told representatives of 33 contributing companies that the main goal is to resolve the robocalls issue and provide a solution to the FCC by October 19. This news has spread positive sentiments among users who are getting spoofed calls. However, its unclear if the consortium can solve this problem once and for all.

Modern Readers Breaking World, Tech, Sports, Business News Business Life Sports Technology World Viral November 23, 2016 Robocalls crackdown features strange Apple and Google alliance and more August 22, 2016 By Lorenzo Tanos We know Apple and Google to be among the fiercest rivals in the world of tech, not to mention two of the most powerful. Now they’re teaming up for a greater good, which is to help get rid of robocalls once and for all. And it’s not just those two, as there are many other big-name companies seemingly out for some robocall blood. Robocalls, or automated phone calls, have come a long way since the days of “Happy Dude” – once again, this writer is referencing an old Simpsons episode here. They’re more cloying and annoying than ever, and they deprive people of some much-deserved peace of mind. Worse, like Happy Dude, they often end up cheating people out of their hard-earned money. But consumers are almost always cheated out of more than just a single dollar when it comes to these phone calls. However, a number of companies, including tech titans Apple and Google, aren’t going to take them sitting down anymore. Apple and Google’s parent Alphabet are just two of the thirty-plus companies in the Robocall Strike Force, an all-star coalition captained by the Federal Communications Commission. These rock stars of the tech and telecommunications spaces are dogged in their desire to fight robocalls, which may also  include automated text messages on top of the usual pre-recorded voice messages from unscrupulous individuals looking to make a quick buck out of gullible recipients. “We know there is a problem. We know how much consumers dislike these calls,” said FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn in a statement. “We know the public is frustrated, because they assumed that after they registered for the ‘Do Not Call’ list, this would stop. It did not, so now it is time to take some real action.” Similarly, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler referred to robocalls as a “scourge,” and mentioned that over half of his agency’s help center tickets in the first half of 2016 were related to these calls. In another set of quotes, AT&T CEO and Robocall Strike Force chairman Randall Stephenson said that the coalition is expected to furnish “concrete plan to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions” by October 19. It isn’t exactly sure what these tools and solutions may be, but they may include new Caller ID verification paradigms that could prevent telemarketers and the like from spoofing telephone numbers, or “Do Not Spoof” lists straight from financial institutions and government agencies.

Starting later this year, new Chrome apps will be available only to Chrome OS users and won’t be accessible on Windows, Mac, and Linux. (Existing apps will remain available and can still be updated.) Then, sometime in the second half of 2017, the Chrome Web Store will no longer display Chrome apps at all on those operating systems. And come early 2018, you’ll no longer be able to load Chrome apps on Windows, Mac, or Linux at all. Extensions and themes are not at all affected by this change; in fact, they’ll soon be given a much larger focus in the Chrome Web Store.

The Nexus suite helps scale your DevOps delivery with continuous component intelligence integrated into development tools, including Eclipse, IntelliJ, Jenkins, Bamboo, SonarQube and more. Schedule a demo today.  Developers use CircleCI to build all sorts of projects. Many of those projects follow the typical one project per repo approach to code organization. Some include documentation, logs, vendor packages, deployment scripts, and more. Then there are the monorepos that companies like Google use. The added complexity that these repos bring leads to a different workflow for many of our customers. There are times where customers don’t want CircleCI to build a trivial commit. Maybe they’re simply adding a note to the README, or a log file was updated. Not building can save container time for the commits that actually need it. CircleCI covers this by supporting the [ci skip] or [skip ci] “flags” in a commit message. If this is needed frequently, prefixing commit messages with [skip ci] every time can get annoying fast. This can be automated with Git hooks. In this blog post, we’re going to create our automated build skipping feature using the commit-msg Git hook. What We’ll Be Using Git Hooks For those not familiar, Git has a system of hooks. These are points in time, before or after a specific action in Git where it can run a script. For example, let’s say that every time a commit is made, we wanted to make sure we are working with the latest upstream code. A Git hook could be utilized that updates master and rebases current branch on master before Git saves the commit. [skip ci] As mentioned previously, CircleCI supports the CI standard commit flag of [skip ci]. When this flag is present in a commit message, CircleCI will not run a build. This can save on the number of containers running and total build minutes used. Using a .ciignore File To mimic Git’s use of the .gitignore file, we’re going to create the concept of a .ciignore file for this blog post. The Git hook we’re creating will use this file to know which files, directories, and patterns should be ignored when running builds Implementing .ciignore in a Repo The scenario we’re using in this post is a .ciignore file in the root directory that will tell Git that we don’t want to do a build on CircleCI when the only changes in a commit are in the logs/ directory. The root of our repo could look something like this: $ ls -la

-rw-rw-r-- 1 felicianotech felicianotech   31 Jun 15 00:44 test.txt The .ciignore file goes in the root of the repo while our Git hook’s file path will be .git/hooks/commit-msg. The contents of each of these files can be seen via the GitHub Gists below. logs/* #!/usr/bin/env bash

if [[ ! -a .ciignore ]]; then
	exit # If .ciignore doesn't exists, just quit this Git hook
fi

# Load in every file that will be changed via this commit into an array
changes=( `git diff --name-only --cached` )

# Load the patterns we want to skip into an array
mapfile -t blacklist < .ciignore

for i in "${blacklist[@]}"
do
	# Remove the current pattern from the list of changes
	changes=( ${changes[@]/$i/} )

	if [[ ${#changes[@]} -eq 0 ]]; then
		# If we've exhausted the list of changes before we've finished going 
		# through patterns, that's okay, just quit the loop
		break
	fi
done

if [[ ${#changes[@]} -gt 0 ]]; then
	# If there's still changes left, then we have stuff to build, leave the commit alone.
	exit
fi

# Prefix the commit message with "[skip ci]"
sed -i '1s/^/[skip ci] /' "$1" .ciignore — This file contains a single pattern, logs/*. We want to skip builds for changes in the logs directory. .git/hooks/commit-msg — This is our hook, a simple Bash script. Here’s a quick breakdown: The script starts by checking for the existence of .ciignore. If it doesn’t exists, that’s cool. It’s business as usual. We then call git diff to get a machine readable list of files that are staged (going to be changed in this commit). We load .ciignore for the list of patterns to ignore. We loop through the changes, removing a change whenever it matches an ignore pattern. If we still have changes, this means we need to actually build the commit so we exit. If we reach this step, we’re going to prefix the commit message (stored in file $1), with [skip ci], saving us some build minutes. Steps 4 & 5 are important because even when a change happens in a directory we want to ignore, if the main source code also changes we still want to build. Otherwise we could end up in a scenario where we add a feature and update a log File in the same commit, and it never gets built meaning the feature’s roll-out now gets delayed. Notes One thing to keep in mind is that hooks don’t travel with the repo. What this means is that client-side hooks, what we’re using here, don’t fall under Git’s version control, nor do they get copied over when a repo is cloned or pushed. To get around this, some people keep hooks in a directory in the repo itself then symlink them into place once they clone the repo. Using Git hooks to create a .ciignore file is just one example of how to utilize Git hooks to improve the daily workflow with CircleCI. Other ideas could be to use a Git hook to modify circle.yml upon commit to only run specific tests. Do you use Git hooks with CircleCI? We’d love to hear about it on Discuss.

But how do you get around in a city with few street names, where buildings have no numbers? “Cross ‘Death Junction’ then after about 500 metres on the left, you’ll see a curtain seller. Go up the path until you see a black building — that’s where I live,” says Judith Koumis, giving directions to her home in Yaounde, the Cameroon capital. “It’s easy,” she says, forgetting, like everyone else, that “Death Junction” has an official name — Friendship Junction. In this west African country, like many other places on the continent, getting around town can be something of a puzzle without a firm grasp of the local landmarks and how they’re known by residents. “Death Junction” in Yaounde, “Crossroads of my misspent life” for a red-light area in the economic hub Douala... such are the often capricious names given to various intersections in Cameroon, even where official names might exist. It’s the same story in neighbouring Gabon where the taxis in the capital Libreville operate along similar lines, using local landmarks to find their way around. Giving a cabbie an address is likely to draw a blank look as their navigation system involves directions more like “behind the prison” or near the “Hassan Hejeij building”, named after a well-known Lebanese businessman who lived there. Finding a business, a doctor or a pharmacy in a hurry is a challenge. Even locating a restaurant, an embassy or a private home requires patience in cities experiencing rampant growth and where informal housing is rife. LOST, LATE, CONFUSED These days, life is a touch less complicated now that most people have mobile phones. “It’s easy to get here, but if you need anything, just call,” Koumis insists. All of which is fine — as long as you don’t run out of battery. And it’s not much easier when dealing with officialdom. “To give the bank my address, I made them a sketch with arrows and the position of the nearby petrol station,” says Gautier, a French national in his 30s who is working in Lambarene in central Gabon. As a result, going around in circles, getting lost and arriving late happens a lot. In recent weeks, the mayor of Yaounde has begun a project to inject some order across the city, whose population, officials say, is close to two million people. The goal is to name every street and number every plot of land, and produce an urban plan “in order to improve location information, to help the emergency services get around... help visiting foreigners get around,” says project head Arnauld Phillipe Ndzana. LOCAL RESISTANCE Under the project, close to 100,000 doors will be given numbers and 5,100 streets named. Currently only 140 streets in Yaounde have names, he said. Not everyone likes the idea. Others worry as the municipality has, over the years, destroyed homes and businesses built on public land or in unplanned areas. “Investigators in the field sometimes encounter hostility from people who think their house will be knocked down or they will have to pay more tax,” says Ndzana. “We have been attacked three times. One resident even came out with a knife and ordered us to go away,” said Blandine Ngo Kam, head of a team working in Briqueterie, a restive Muslim neighbourhood of the city. An initial project to assign addresses in the town was carried out in 1994 but no one, including government offices, saw the need so never used them, Ndzana said. Last September, Libreville launched a similar project in the presence of several mayors of big francophone cities, including Paris’ Anne Hidalgo. There again, not everyone was pleased. “It is our cultural identity that is going to suffer,” some residents said. EASILY FIND AN ADDRESS Private initiatives have also tried to untangle Africa’s urban labyrinths. In Doula, in Cameroon’s south, young telecoms engineer Samuel Bamal in February launched a mobile geolocation app called ShoOwer . “It’s a tool which helps you get your bearings and easily find an address either with or without an Internet connection,” says Bama, a 28-year-old resident of the city. With the rapid growth of our cities, “we are trying to resolve the problem of addresses in Africa.” Currently, some 15,000 locations are listed in the application’s database covering “six or seven towns”, and the app already has “5,000 users, of whom 1,200 actively use it” every day, he says. The application is free to download on Google Play, but the user must cover the cost of the SMS messages if he cannot do his research online. In short, it might give you what you need to reach Judith’s house on time. ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES   1. We welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Go up the path until you see a black building -- that’s where I live,” says Judith Koumis, giving directions to her home in Yaounde, the Cameroon capital. By Reinnier Kaze Yaoundé. Maps, road signs, sat navs, Google maps -- it all makes travelling so easy. But how do you get around in a city with few street names, where buildings have no numbers? “Cross ‘Death Junction’ then after about 500 metres on the left, you’ll see a curtain seller.

While companies like Apple, Google, Samsung and Facebook are curled up in their secret labs working on virtual and mixed reality platforms, Intel has come out in the open to showcase a sleek VR gear which will offer users a rich, immersive experience. Intel’s new VR gear will transport users to the sandy beaches of Caribbean or the deserts of Dubai. You could even take a peek at the Eiffel Tower or the Colosseum of Rome — without even being there. Intel now has a standalone VR Headset which doesn't require a PC – #ProjectAlloy #VirtualReality https://t.co/niXKZj76ZY — PhoneBunch (@PhoneBunch) August 20, 2016 Dubbed Project Alloy, Intel’s virtual reality goggles — also made compatible for so-called mixed reality — drags real-world objects into the virtual realm using 3D cameras. The new all-in-one virtual reality solution leverages Intel RealSense technology. Project Alloy will be offered as an open platform in 2017, the company announced. According to the company’s press release, Intel is focusing on two prime aspects, ease of use and immersive experience. In an effort to make the mixed reality experience hassle-free, Intel has made sure that its new gear is sleek and handy. This means no pesky wires hanging out of the device, which might ruin the user experience. .@Intel's CEO talks about #ProjectAlloy and ushering in the era of “merged reality.” https://t.co/srXqubFGOd #virtualreality — SpaceGamesFederation (@SpaceGamesFed) August 17, 2016 The headset uses Intel’s RealSense cameras, which have depth-sensing capabilities, to allow objects such as the user’s hands to be tracked and entered into the virtual world displayed within the goggles. It does not require additional sensors. “The computing power is located in the Alloy Head-Mounted Device (HMD), which allows the user to experience VR untethered. That means you can ‘cut the VR cord,’ allowing a free range of motion with six degrees-of-freedom across a large space. This, combined with collision detection and avoidance, enables the user to utilize physical movement to explore a virtual space,” the press release stated. The new merged reality is powered by Intel RealSense cameras attached to the VR headset and is not dependent on setting up any external sensors or cameras around the room. During the opening keynote of the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on August 16, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said, “Merged reality delivers virtual-world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before – and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible.” “Pick up your real-world tennis racket in your living room and step virtually on to the court at Wimbledon. Be the ultimate concert master – fully unplugged. Plan your virtual visit to the Sistine Chapel while never leaving the office. Experience a sporting event, a concert or a film scene from any point of view – and from any position,” he said, according to a report by The Guardian. Intel also intends to open source the Alloy hardware next year, alongside its RealSense application programming interface (API) so third-party manufacturers can develop headsets of their own that run on Windows 10 and tap into Intel tech. “Anybody can take the Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class virtual reality system with any manufacturer they choose,” Krzanich said, according to The Verge. “Merged reality goes beyond computer-generated content. It’s about bringing the real physical world into the digital world real time — and reimagining it with computing power,”said Krzanich in his blog on Medium. “Regardless of whether you’re seeking to experience augmented reality or virtual reality, your freedom in the world of your choice depends on how you merge your realities and the technologies that enable you to cross over from the physical to the virtual, and the virtual to the physical. We’re rapidly moving toward a world where the boundary between the digital and the physical is eroding, and merging in new exciting ways. It’s truly the best of all worlds — and there’s only more to come,” added Krzanich.
