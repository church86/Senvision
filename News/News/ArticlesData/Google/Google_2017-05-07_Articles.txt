(Reuters) Just days ahead of its annual developer conference “Google I/O”, the company Google has announced to end the Android “Nougat” Beta and will soon launch Android “O” Beta. “Thank you for your interest in the Android Beta Programme. The beta for Android Nougat has concluded, and all devices that were opted in have been updated to the current public version,” Google said in an update to the Android beta website. “If you are still running a beta version of Nougat you may download the latest full OTA image for your device and sideload it. This will not wipe your device. We’ll update this site when the Android O Beta Programme begins,” the update added. To date, Google had been providing Beta versions of Android Nougat (versions 7.x) alongside early “Developer Preview” versions of Android O which is touted as the next major Android version. “But many Pixel and Nexus users are waiting for the Android O beta as the developer preview is not really intended for public consumption,” BetaNews reported on Monday.

By: IANS | San Francisco | Published: May 8, 2017 11:22 AM People leave flowers at a makeshift memorial after shooting in San Bernardino, California December 7, 2015. (Reuters) Blaming the tech giants for being “instrumental to the rise of ISIS (Islamic State),” the families of 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack victims have filed a lawsuit against Facebook, Google and Twitter. According to media reports on Monday, the family members of three victims who were killed along with 11 others in the terrorist attack on a health facility, alleged that the three tech companies “knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits”. “This material support has been instrumental to the rise of ISIS and has enabled it to carry out or cause to be carried out, numerous terrorist attacks, including December 2, 2015, attack in San Bernadino,” they said in the 32-page lawsuit filed with the US District Court in Los Angeles last week. “Without defendants Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the claim says. “Concerning Twitter, for example, the families point out the flood of ISIS-related accounts on the platform in recent years,” Re/Code reported.Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik began shooting at Farook’s co-workers in San Bernardino in December 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. “About Facebook, they contend that the San Bernardino shooters, including Tashfeen, had declared their allegiance to ISIS in a previous Facebook post. Also Watch: As for Google, they allege that it essentially helps fund ISIS through advertisements that run before YouTube videos,” the report added. There three companies were yet to comment on this. There has already been a huge court battle after the shooting where the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) took Apple to court, demanding a security backdoor that would allow them to unlock the iPhone of one of the killers. This is not the only incident where families of terror victims have taken tech giants to court. Families of three victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting that left 50 dead and 53 wounded in June last year have sued tech giants Facebook, Google and Twitter for allegedly providing “material support” to the Islamic State terrorist group and helping radicalise shooter Omar Mateen. According to a reports, the lawsuit was filed in federal court in the eastern district of Michigan on behalf of the families of Tevin Crosby, Javier Jorge-Reyes and Juan Ramon Guerrero, stating that the three web platforms “provided the terrorist group IS with accounts they use to spread extremist propaganda, raise funds and attract new recruits.” “Without Defendants Twitter, Facebook, and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of IS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” Fox News cited the lawsuit as saying.

This after the company said its 2015 target to train one million Africans in digital skills had been reached earlier than it had initially planned. The country director at Google South Africa, Luke Mckend, said the company was committed to help local businesses thrive online, as they are meaningful partners in the country’s and continent's economy growing. Share this story Google chief executive Sundar Pichai says Google will be  expanding its African digital skills programme by adding offline versions of its online training materials. Photo: Reuters “Through our different initiatives, a number of small businesses have been helped. Our tools and technologies are simply enablers for anyone who wants to build a global business to connect with new customers or share their creations. Whether it’s a dressmaker who plans on expanding worldwide through the tools technology provides them, or a content creator finding hundreds of thousands of viewers on YouTube,” Mckend said. Google said that its free digital skills programme offered 89 courses through the online digital skills portal, and the company worked with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face-to-face training. Read also: Google to ramp up Africa investment According to the Human Capital Index released last week by the World Economic Forum, it found that 41 percent of all work activities in South Africa are susceptible to automation and 39 percent of core skills required across occupations would be wholly different by 2020. The study also found that the average information and communication technologies intensity of jobs in South Africa increased by 23 percent over the last decade. Google said it had reached its target to reach 1 million digitally unskilled people in March. The majority of the trainees came from Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. However, South Africa lagged far behind compared to the other two countries in the number of people trained. Nigeria had 450 000 people trained, while Kenya had 450 000 people taking part in the programme. South Africa had just 70 000 people trained. The growth and brand leader for sub-Saharan Africa, Bunmi Banjo, said as the company moves to expand this initiative to hard-to-reach areas across the continent, it hoped to see more impact in everyday lives of Africans. “Having 1 million digitally skilled young people in Africa is good for everyone. If young people have the right skills, they’ll build businesses, create jobs and boost economic growth across the continent.” BUSINESS REPORT Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Report links Malema to plot to topple Mugabe 2 ICYMI: Mamba snared at Westville home 3 Suncoast refurbish delays an embarrassment for Durban 4 Answers wanted from Zille over R1m trip to Asia 5 Free State premier faces revolt Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Pitroda, a telecom inventor and policy maker, has emphasized that online platforms such as Google, Facebook and Twitter should take the responsibility of the content that is posted on their websites. While speaking to a gathering of Pune International Centre members at the College of Engineering in Pune, he noted that individuals around the world coordinating under the Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy (AAID) in Paris have asked for better moderation of content on social media networks. “Twenty of us from all over the world have come together and we want big companies like Facebook and Google to take responsibility for their content,” Pitroda said. Pitroda was referring to the Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy (AAID), a Paris-based agency with the objective to protect the integrity and societal values on the internet. He is currently working as one of the 24 board members of AAID. He went on to add that “If newspapers publish incorrect information, they will apologize. On the other hand, Google and Facebook won’t even remove the content. So, this has been bothering us for quite some time”. According to the report by Times of India, Pitroda indicated that there are a lot of incorrect news articles posted online and that social media is filled with misinformation, gossip and vendetta. Pitroda pointed out that people are encouraged to add to the misinformation because ‘it gets them more hits.’ He focused on the need for a new way of thinking in the digital age, pointing out that India is most suited to build the new design. “The world can only be redesigned by Indians but we are not ready to take on a task like this because our house is not in order. Today, the world is waiting for India to take the lead,” said Pitroda. He concluded by adding that “People want family values, love, compassion — all of which India has and also it has costumes, colour, food, diversity.” Publish date: May 8, 2017 10:48 am| Modified date: May 8, 2017 10:48 am Tags: accountability, Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy, Facebook, fake news, Father of Indian Telecom, Google, India, responsibility, Sam Pitroda, Social Media Also read Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales launches platform called Wikitribune to tackle fake news USA Today asks FBI to investigate spammers on its Facebook page X Recommended For You Google has patented a gesture for closing apps on your smartphone, PC or projector Google agrees to pay $334 million to settle tax dispute with Italy Families of San Bernardino shooting are taking Facebook, Google and Twitter to court Judge claims that there is no clear evidence to prove claim Waymo’s claims against Uber Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

Govt denies blocking Google and YouTube May 08, 2017 11:23 By The Nation  The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society denied the government ordered the blocking of Google and YouTube after they were temporarily inaccessible, Thai National News Bureau reported on Monday.  There was speculation the Internet giants may have been blocked after people using the 3BB Internet service were unable to log on to them on Saturday.  Deputy permanent secretary for the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, Group Captain Somsak Kaosuwan, said blocking Google or YouTube would require a court order after an action was initiated by the National Broadcast and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), which must request compliance by major site administrators such as Google.  He said the state had no reason to shut down an Internet service such as Google, adding that the search engine and YouTube may have merely been experiencing technical difficulties.  He stressed the government’s relationship with Google had always been positive and the company had been accommodating to Thailand’s laws while being sensitive to individual rights. Somsak asked the online community to be wary of unsubstantiated claims and asked people to report questionable information to the NBTC via its hotline 1200.

Google officially rebrands 'Google for Work' as 'Google Cloud' and 'Google Apps for Work' as 'G Suite' Martim Lobao Follow View All Posts 2016/09/29 12:28pm PDTSep 29, 2016 41 Plus 1 on G+ 47 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares199 News Videos After a report from The Information a few days ago claiming that Google would be ditching the Google for Work brand today, Google has officially announced that their business-oriented service will now simply be called Google Cloud. This actually isn't the first time the platform is being rebranded — you may recall it used to be called Google Apps for Your Domain a few years back. Obviously, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but it's possible Google may be targeting a wider audience by deemphasizing the 'work' aspect from the name. One of the more important components of Google Cloud is the collection of apps that make up Google Apps for Work, including Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and a handful of other popular products. In the same vein as Google Cloud, this suite of apps is now fittingly called G Suite, and Google has taken the opportunity to sprinkle in a few new features as well. Improvements to Google's products include making relevant files more readily accessible in Drive, scheduling a meeting at a time that works for all invitees in Calendar, using natural language processing in Sheets to figure out complicated calculations, dynamically offering layout suggestions for Presentations, and many improvements for teams.

Why not "Google Cloud Suite", together with the already existing "Google Cloud Platform"? TattoozNTech this comment, nail on the head!!! i'll just keep calling my account Google Apps, cuz "G Suite" sounds like a dubiously upgraded, special set of rooms in a hotel somewhere. Dennis Ulijn Be glad they didn't call it the G spot... Knowing Google that could just as well been a contender... TattoozNTech i actually thought about that earlier. you're totally right. thartist You know what? This has burnt my fuses, but also that's all the confirmation i needed that there are some retards infesting the helm of Google directives. Killing Nexus for Pixel before Andromeda is out, making/accepting a hideous device, and pricing it stupid high with no water resistance... and G Suite? David Hyman Wasn't Google cloud their Amazon competitor? amnesia That's GCP - Google Cloud Platform. David Hyman Ah! I'm sure no one will confuse those ever :D MAS Googler Just wait a week. That will be renamed as well. Google Platform for App Hosting Suite and Analytics. Andrew Palmer Do AndroidPolice happen to use Google Apps? mxwp They do. cadtek91 What is Google Cloud minus the Apps then? I always thought they were one in the same. Alfonso Surroca The name is stupid, but that was one of the most beautiful motion graphics animations I've seen. Chris I'm honestly just becoming exhausted with the constant changes/cancellations/redos at google... k sand Yeah I love Android but some of the names they pick for things are just stupid. Ryan Johnson Seriously... sometimes change for the sake of change just needs to stop at Google. Spence1115 I'm sorry, G Suite? Alfredo Hernández Google being Google. Gerjannn Where is the green color in the video? cadtek91 You'll get green from the money earned when the company uses G Suite ;) drcaveman Did Bing Search for G Suite, first result was the G Suite at the Palms Casino and Resort, image below. used Bing because Google just returned stuff related to its own service https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3591ff3fe44d06bf65565b7286b06b8198df3a542f866f4f16dcc0bf656ecdb7.jpg TattoozNTech exactly! right on with the same thing i said about this! Comediante Google clearly doesnt know the definition of branding and brand managemet. Why completely change the name of a well stablished product? cadtek91 They are moving towards a cohesive "G" brand. Mix G spot rocks the G spot! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUDFA79yh9Y PVL_93_RU Since when? cadtek91 Now, with the G on the Pixel phone and in the advertising, the G in the Chromecast boot animation, there will probably one on Google Home, and probably on the new watches they are making. MAS Googler They are rebranding nearly everything, to make it cohesive across the platforms, software, and devices. Regardless if it's Chrome, ChromeOS, Android, or Google apps & services. They are making a concerted effort to unify Branding under tighter umbrellas. Example, renaming all devices Pixel. Or using "G" to signify Google Service. Using "Assistant" as a catch-all, rather than Google Now, Cards, and Assistant. yl3v Hoping with the new features, they bring all functionality to G Suite customers (Now cards, Fi, etc.) k sand Sooo - change work to cloud ok that's just as stupid as renaming app store to PLAY. NERV Rebrand..rename...redo....repeating the failure again and again.... Deeco Google constant Inconsistency continues... k sand I'd personally prefer apps that get name changes to be at least relevant to their purpose. When I see CLOUD I'm surely not going to think business or work (sigh), I'll be thinking storage. I still see PLAY & think games or music but not the bloody freaking app store & it's irritating. K_i_l_g_o_r_e_T_r_o_u_t I see "cloud" and I think 2008. k sand Lol Josh Rahn Whats next? Maybe we should hold a lottery? My guess is they're going to kill keep, and rebrand drive and pick a new shape for icons. Aren't we due for a UI overhaul??? Material has got to go. hehe Mix Great, G-Sweet is my amateur name for when I am rap battling. Now my fans are going to be confused. GG Google, GG. AbbyZFresh Rap battling? Are you stuck in 2004? lol. MAS Googler Don't be judging his FunkyFreshness..... MAS Googler I thought that was a porn name? G-Sweet, all up in the Spot. Mix G-Sweet, all up in the Spot. I take your wicked lyrics and make them booties drop. twerking, working and popping all them 'roids. You know I'm dissing Apple and loving them Androids. Ugh tiss, ugh, ugh tiss.. See amateur rapper.........lol ProvoAggie When will they let me use my Google Apps/Work/G-Suite account for Play Music Family Plan and other services that they don't currently allow. MAS Googler Possibly never. Google for Work is aimed at enterprise (where they are trying to compete with Microsoft). So personal entertainment apps, like Play Music will not be a focus. The focus is on productivity & networking. If you want entertainment type apps, your better off using a personal account rather than a business/enterprise focused account. Especially since enterprise/business apps & services need to roll out updates slowly & very focused, as to not break or cause issues. It's easier to beta test & throw out entertainment focused products to consumers, but enterprise/IT/Businesses want stability and hate speedy change. Mike S (OK, this is an OLD topic, but it just bit me once again) MAS Googler - I have to think you either came late to this subject or are ignoring that the Google Apps product WAS aimed at Families, right along with enterprise and education. Google appears to be hoping that the folks that signed up their families to the "Google Apps with domain name" will just leave or something. They haven't disabled the existing features (yet) but they sure aren't letting us use any of the new bells and whistles. MAS Googler If you want family services & personal entertainment services, then use the consumer products. Not the Enterprise & business products. Enterprise & business isn't going to be focused on "family music sharing". It will be focused on stability, performance, and productivity for workers. Family music sharing isn't part of that focus. PVL_93_RU Really? G-Suite? Why not Google Suite? Blake Ok, possibly I am just dumb.....but, can someone explain to me the difference between Google for Work and the regular Google apps that I use (like Drive, Calendar, etc)? And what's the difference between Google Cloud and G Suite now? No offense, but AP never explains this....at least not very well. SimonSaid I am always wondering this! Anybody able to explain? MAS Googler One is business focused, and often "pay per user". Sort of like having Microsoft Office 365, on-premesis hybrid cloud, and ability for IT to manage & monitor employee access. MAS Googler Your personal use, you can do whatever you want. Google business is enterprise Aimed, with IT account management (allow/deny access to company servers, files, intranet, email, etc, etc). IT can monitor your usage. IT can allow or block specific apps & sites. All the typical enterprise focused things. There are also specific apps (and a sort of enterprise focused app store) that a business can institute for apps like analytics, intranet social (like a Yammer). Basically, MS enterprise solutions using Google's service Blake Nice. Thanks! Maleko No wonder some people don't want to adopt the Google cloud... they don't know what it's called or what does what anymore.... MaryJane Obviously, this is the same smartass that keeps renaming NYC's bridges and tunnels. jwildman16 I feel like some really big improvements just got glossed over. Drive for Teams is going to be immensely beneficial in the work environment and the enhancements to / addition of Explore in Sheets, Docs, and Slides could bring huge efficiency gains. ginstr The new name and logo will appear in the Google Admin console, online help, and email notifications. G Suite is still the same all-in-one solution that you use every day, with the same powerful tools like Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Calendar. Your services and pricing remain the same.

Windows 10S  Microsoft tries locking down again Posted on 8-May-2017 15:19 by Bill Bennett | Filed under: Articles : Bill Bennett At first sight Microsoft’s Surface Laptop and Windows 10S launch is all about education. That was the company’s emphasis at the product roll-out in New York. Yet there is more at stake here than putting computers in school bags. The announcement outlines a strategy for the stage of personal computing. If Microsoft pulls this off, it will once again dominate the sector. On the SurfaceSurface Laptop is Microsoft’s most ambitious touch screen hardware product to date. Previous Microsoft devices; Surface Pro tablets, Surface Book, Surface Hub and Surface Studio, are all niche products. They cater for minority tastes. The Surface Laptop is mainstream. It competes head on with hardware from brands like HP, Lenovo and Asus. The Surface Laptop is a direct challenge to Apple’s MacBook range. It doesn’t directly address Google’s Chromebook, but Microsoft developed the Surface Laptop with that product in mind. ChromebookChromebook is a basic, low-cost, easy-to-manage laptop. It has sold well. It is one of the few PC success stories of recent years. Chromebook sales have climbed while sales of most other computer formats have been in free fall. It is more sucessful than Google’s rivals expected. Above all else the Chromebook is strong in education. Yet that’s only part of the story. IDC’s latest market survey says Chromebook are now selling well to commercial customers. We can assume Microsoft understands the Chromebook threatens its PC business. Chrome OSChromebooks run Google’s Chrome OS. In effect, the operating system is the Chrome browser. Chrome OS is light on features. You can’t do everything with Chrome OS. You don’t have as much low-level control. But that’s a good thing for many customers. Lots of users don’t need all the personal computer trimmings. They just want to get a limited set of tasks done in an unfussy way. This applies in spades to young school students. More to the point, school students and their families are not willing or able to pay for a more powerful computer with a full operating system. You can buy a Chromebook in New Zealand for less than NZ$400. Brands like HP, Asus, Acer and Lenovo all have versions. This is less than half the price of a mainstream laptop. It is about one-quarter the price of the cheapest Apple Mac. In many schools Chromebooks have displaced Windows laptops. Microsoft botheredThat bothers Microsoft. Aside from the impact on today’s market share and revenue, there is a risk people will get a taste for Chromebooks. Youngsters growing up with school Chromebooks may stick with them later in life. Or if not Chromebook, something else that doesn’t involve Microsoft Windows. The no Windows habit could rub off on their families, friends and workplaces. Microsoft wants to counter that threat. The Surface Laptop looks great but it is not going to do that. For a start it is too expensive. It sells in the US for $1000. That’s four or five times the price of a Chromebook. It is a premium 13-inch laptop, more a competitor to models like the MacBook, HP Spectre and Dell XPS 13. It’s lighter and thinner than a MacBook Air. It costs less and is more powerful. That comparison is a whole other story that needs closer inspection. Maybe another post. We’re going to look at something more fundamental here. While Surface Laptop is inexpensive compared to, say, a MacBook Pro or Surface Book, it’s not going to shake up the education market. That job goes to Windows 10S. Where Windows 10S fitsThere are, of course, plenty of low-cost Windows laptops to choose from. Asus, Lenovo and Acer all have PCs in New Zealand that sell for under NZ$400. If you can afford a little more, there are plenty of better models for less than NZ$500. Low-cost Windows laptops tend to be clunky and inelegant. They are not powerful by 2017 standards. But, like Chromebooks, they get the job done. At least they would get the job done but for one problem. To claw back the dollars makers don’t earn from hardware sales, they load them with trial software. This often makes more money for the computer maker than they get from the hardware sale. CrapwareSoftware makers pay to have their apps included as standard on PCs. They may call their products trial ware or use some other coy name. We know them as crapware. The name is well deserved. These programs are ugly. They make for an awful user experience. They bombard people with messages. At times they can frighten less experienced or tech-savvy users. Some include marketing messages that border on blackmail. Crapware often slows computers down. It can introduce security risks. More than one of these programs has included a serious malware payload in the past. Other crapware programs report key information back to their owners behind the computer user’s back. Even the best crapware is annoying. It can pop up with a distracting, unwelcome message at an inappropriate moment. In effect, you can get a great deal on a low-end PC in return for accepting a steaming pile of crapware. What a time to be alive. Windows 10SBy locking down the computer, Microsoft says Windows 10S will improve security and performance. It keeps things simple. Windows 10S makes it easy for administrators to manage fleets of computers. And it locks out crapware. If you choose to stick with Windows 10S, and that’s optional, then you’ll only be able to install apps from the official Microsoft app store. Now that may not be what you want from a computer. But there are people who like the sound of this. Remember Windows RT?We’ve been here before. Windows RT was the Microsoft operating system on the first Surface Tablets. It had the same lock-down approach and similar restrictions. It was a commercial flop. RT cost Microsoft hundreds of millions of dollars. In practice, Windows RT was not an awful OS. After all Apple’s iOS is locked down in a similar way and that’s been a winner. The issue is that Microsoft Windows users want different things from their devices to Apple users. One of them is the ability to run tons of obscure, esoteric and, in some cases, poorly written niche apps. Creating a version of Windows that can’t run most Windows apps was a mistake. Unlike Apple, Microsoft failed to make sure the app store was packed with all the must have apps. Using the RT store was like walking into a shop with dusty, empty shelves and few recognisable products or brands. This time is different…?You may ask yourself what’s different this time. The simple answer is that Microsoft will force Windows 10S on the market. Most or at least many future Windows PCs will come with Windows 10S installed at the outset. Customers can upgrade, if upgrade is the right word here, to a full unlocked version of Windows 10 by paying US$50. Inertia and a reluctance to spend any money means many customers will never upgrade. Big guns buy-inAnother difference this time is that Windows hardware makers are joining the lockdown party. Some of the biggest names will have Windows 10S laptops on sale within weeks. It’s going to be hard for PC buyers to ignore these machines. The list of companies already signed up is a who’s who of the hardware business. With Windows 10S users will only be able to get apps from Microsoft’s App Store. That means the company gets to clip the ticket with every purchase. Independent developers may whinge, but the same approach has worked well for Apple. App gapWhen it arrives a lot of popular Windows apps will not be available for Windows 10S. Among the stand-outs are the Chrome browser and iTunes. The pair may not be your favourite apps, but they are popular. What happens when a user, who has paid a bargain basement price for their PC, learns they need to shell out another $50 to run Chrome or iTunes? The deal is worse than that. When you switch to the full version of Windows, you lose a lot of the security benefits. The responsibility of managing your system returns. Again that may not worry you, but it will be a problem for some others. Competition bashingIf you read the above section and thought Windows 10S will cause headaches for Microsoft’s biggest competitors, you’d be right. It’s no accident Chrome and iTunes were mentioned above. Google and Apple need to put their games theory strategists onto this one. Do they invest in creating Microsoft app store versions of their software? If they don’t they run the risk of being cast adrift from large numbers of their customers. Although it’s possible the disconnected customers might be the kind that don’t use their software anyway. EcosystemIf Google and Apple do build app store versions, they help Microsoft create a formidable ecosystem that may bash them again later. Windows 10S is likely to be a hit with schools and organizations that want to impose order on PCs. Otherwise there’s always a chance Microsoft’s customers may walk away from Windows 10S. People don’t have many other places to go. Chrome OS is even more locked down. Apple is less so, but the nuances of its approach aren’t always understood. Microsoft still accounts for the vast majority of PC operating systems. So it looks like it will succeed this time. But there’s always a possibility Windows 10S will be an RT rerun with even high stakes.

A Staff Writer Google (Alphabet Inc.) and Facebook made $79.4 billion and $26.9 billion, respectively, in advertising revenue in 2016. Photo: Bloomberg Google and Facebook together accounted for 20% of global advertising expenditure across all media in 2016, up from 11% in 2012, according to a report titled Top Thirty Global Media Owners, published by media agency Zenith, a part of Publicis Media. Between 2012 and 2016, the two companies captured 64% of the growth in global advertising expenditure. Google, under its holding company Alphabet Inc., is by some distance the largest media owner in the world, attracting $79.4 billion in advertising revenue in 2016, three times more than Facebook, the second-largest, which attracted $26.9 billion, according to the report. Click here for enlarge The largest traditional media owner is Comcast, which takes the third place in the ranking, with $12.9 billion in ad revenue. Zenith’s quarterly Advertising Expenditure Forecasts published in March this year stated that has overtaken television to become the world’s largest advertising medium. It said global Internet advertising expenditure will grow 13% to reach $205 billion in 2017 and that Internet will attract 36.9% of all advertising expenditure, up from 34% in 2016. This will be the first year when more money will be spent on Internet advertising than on traditional television (which will total $192 billion). Accordingly, digital platforms funded by Internet advertising dominate Zenith’s top 30 ranking. Other than Alphabet and Facebook, there are five pure-Internet media owners in the top 30—Baidu, Microsoft, Yahoo, Verizon and Twitter. Between them, the seven digital platforms generated $132.8 billion in Internet ad revenue in 2016—73% of the entire Internet ad spend and 24% of global ad spend across all media. Alphabet Inc. Alphabet Inc. CEO Larry Page. Photo: Bloomberg Advertisement revenue in 2016: $79,383 million Media owned: Internet Alphabet tops the list, way ahead of the competition. Created in August 2015, Alphabet is a collection of businesses, which fall under one of two segments: Google, which includes the main Internet-related products and services; and Other Bets, for newer initiatives, such as life sciences, Calico and Nest. Developer of the world-leading search engine, Google earned 88% of its revenues through online search advertising in 2016 (although the proportion of its revenues deriving from non-advertising sources such as hardware sales, sales of apps, in-app purchases and digital content products, as well as service and licensing fees, is increasing all the time). The AdWords auction-based program allows targeted advertising for businesses, while the third parties that make up the Google Network use the AdSense program to deliver user-relevant ads and generate more revenue. Meanwhile, Google Analytics provides detailed statistics about any given website’s traffic, which is very useful for marketers and is typical of Google’s integrated approach to its products. It also owns the smartphone operating system Android—originally developed by a separate company of the same name, which Google backed financially and then bought out in 2005. In October 2016 it launched Pixel, the first Google-branded smartphone, to general acclaim. Other key products include web browser Google Chrome, Cloud, Apps and Google Play, as well as hardware, such as Chromebooks and Nexus. Total advertising revenue increased from US$67.4 billion in 2015 to US$79.4 billion in 2016, with operating profits up 22.5% over the same period to US$23.7 billion.

Photo: Reuters Advertisement revenue in 2016: $26,885 million Media owned: Internet Facebook is a pure-play Internet platform and the world’s second largest media owner by ad revenue, accounting for 15% of global Internet advertising expenditure—and 5% of total advertising expenditure—in 2016. Its ad revenues have grown at an average of 44% a year for the last five years, thanks to its huge reach, its detailed knowledge of its users, and its early and successful adoption of mobile advertising. Facebook was launched in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and his college roommates, and was initially exclusive to Harvard University. It soon spread to other educational institutions around the US, then Canada, and by late 2006 it was open to anyone over the age of 13 with an email address. By the end of 2013 it had 1.2 billion users who visited at least once a month, and 800 million who visited once a day. By the end of 2016 these numbers had risen to 1.9 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively. That means half of all the world’s Internet users log in at least once a month, and a third log in every day. Facebook sells advertising on its main website and associated app, on its second platform Instagram, and on third-party platforms. It allows advertisers to target users based on the highly personal information that they provide, such as the details of their most intimate relationships, and the books, films, products, services, political parties and places they like best. Mobile advertising contributed 83% of Facebook’s total ad revenue in 2016, up from 77% in 2015. Most digital platforms have struggled to adapt to mobile devices, where standard display ads are intrusive and less effective. Facebook’s news feed ads sit naturally in the flow of content viewed by its users, and work well in the mobile format. Facebook’s mobile ad revenues exceeded its desktop ad revenues by the end of 2013, a milestone that the Internet as a whole did not achieve until 2017. Most Internet advertising is now mobile, so Facebook can no longer rely on the transition from desktop to mobile to fuel growth in its ad revenues. Now it is focusing on the next transition, from text and images to video. Facebook hosts billions of video views per day, and since May 2016 has allowed users to share live video with each other. Facebook is publicly listed on Nasdaq. Mark Zuckerberg remains the largest shareholder with an approximate 24% stake.

Comcast is a media and communications company based in the US, but with several international television channels. Photo: Reuters Advertisement revenue in 2016: $12,918 million Media owned: Television and Internet Comcast Corp. is a media and communications company based in the US, but with several international television channels. It has two main businesses: Comcast Cable, a leading telecom services provider that offers video, phone and high-speed Internet services to 29 million residential and business customers in the US (the former under the XFINITY brand); and NBCUniversal, which operates news, entertainment and sports cable networks and the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks. NBCUniversal also has filmed entertainment, and theme parks divisions, which are key contributors to the overall business. Following a small decline in 2015, Comcast’s ad revenues rose by 13% to $12.9 billion in 2016. Total revenue was up 8% year-on-year, with operating profit up 5%. NBCUniversal’s cable networks division spans 16 national cable networks in the US, 15 regional sports and news networks, and more than 60 international channels. The broadcast TV division, meanwhile, runs the US national TV network NBC and the Spanish-language network Telemundo, which reaches 59% of Hispanic television households in the US; it also includes the 10 NBC and 17 Telemundo local broadcast TV stations. NBC News and NBC Sports are important members of the broadcast brand, the latter hosting the top-rated Sunday Night Football. The majority (81% in 2016) of Comcast’s ad revenue comes from these two divisions. The remaining $2.52 billion in 2016 ad revenue came from Comcast Cable, which is granted an allocation of ad slots within the cable networks it transmits to its customers. This is only 5% of the total revenue generated by Comcast Cable, which gets most of its money directly from its cable customers. Comcast has plans to launch a mobile phone service this year, expanding its triple-play offering to four products.

Baidu CEO Robin Li. Photo: Reuters Advertisement revenue in 2016: $10,362 million Media owned: Television and Internet Baidu Inc. rises to the fourth place in this year’s edition, reflecting the breakneck pace of its growth—it broke into the ranking at number 28 just three years ago (in a list ranked by our previous definition of “media revenue”). It offers Chinese language Internet search services and is one of three entries in our top 30 based in China, the others being the state TV broadcaster CCTV and social networking/gaming/messaging giant Tencent. Formed in 2000 as a search engine for other sites such as Sohu and Sina, Baidu soon became a website brand in its own right and floated on the NASDAQ exchange in 2005—where it is now a member of the NASDAQ-100 index. Its offering is in many ways similar to that of Google: its principal property, the baidu.com website, has a simple, clean appearance—its homepage consists of a search box in the middle of the page on a white background, with the Baidu logo above the box. Users can search the web, images, news, videos and use various tools such as Baidu Maps and Baidu Knows (a question answering service) among many others. Like Google, Baidu has developed a wide variety of services intended to serve consumers’ requests for information and entertainment, with products ranging from social networking to security, including user generated content, location-based services, entertainment, mobile services, and e-commerce. Baidu’s search services are used by more than 90% of all Chinese Internet users. Most of Baidu’s services are free for consumers, and it generates the vast majority of its revenue from advertising. This advertising appears alongside Baidu’s search results and content from its other services, as well as alongside the content of third-party websites belonging to the Baidu Union network. China’s Internet users are rapidly switching their browsing habits from desktop to mobile. Baidu’s mobile search traffic exceeded its desktop traffic for the first time in Q3 2014, and in Q4 2016 Baidu’s mobile revenue accounted for 65% of total revenue, up from 56% a year earlier.

Photo: Bloomberg Advertisement revenue in 2016: $8,649 million Media owned: Television and Internet Walt Disney Co. generates revenue in four key segments: media networks, parks and resorts, studio entertainment, and consumer products and interactive media. The media networks division includes Disney’s domestic and international television channels, and its television production business. Parks and resorts is the side of the business that runs the theme parks and cruise ships. Studio entertainment is the film distribution segment. And consumer products and interactive media is devoted to merchandising, books and other consumer items, as well as online properties such as multi-platform gaming, online advertising and sponsorships. The relevant divisions to this report are media networks, and consumer products and interactive media. Advertising is one of the main sources of revenue for media networks, generating $8.61 billion in 2016 and accounting for 36% of its revenue that year. Fifty-two percent of its revenue came from affiliate fees (fees paid by cable operators and other distributors to allow them to carry the Disney channels), while the rest came from other distribution fees and programme sales. Advertising is a relatively minor component of the consumer products and interactive media business, generating $130 million in 2016, or just 2% of the division’s total. The Disney Channel is the best-known of the TV properties that carry the Disney brand. In 2015, it was the most-watched network in the US among total viewers for the first time. Disney Channels Worldwide, which includes the Disney Channel, Disney Junior and Disney XD among others, provides over 100 channels in 34 languages to 163 markets across the world. But Disney has other important TV assets, too, including one of the top US TV national networks, ABC, which broadcasts hits such as Grey’s Anatomy, Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Once Upon A Time. Cable network Freeform (formerly ABC Family) is a US channel targeted at viewers aged 14-34. Disney also owns 80% of the sports entertainment company ESPN, which operates eight sports networks. In India, Disney owns the children’s entertainment channel Hungama, the movie channels UTV Action and UTV Movies, youth entertainment channel Bindass and music channel Bindass Play. Media properties Television USA: Disney channels—Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD; ABC Television Network; ABC Owned Television Stations Group; Freeform; ESPN (80% stake)—ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNEWS, SEC Network, ESPN Classics, ESPN Deportes, and the Longhorn Network.

Deputy Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society Group Captain Somsak Kaosuwan has refuted claims the government attempted to block access to YouTube and Google for political reasons. The rumor was begun after users of 3BB Internet Service were unable to log on to the sites. The deputy permanent secretary explained that website closures require a court order and are enacted by the National Broadcast and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), which must request compliance by major site administrators such as Google. He revealed that the government’s relationship with Google has always been positive and the company has been accommodating to Thailand’s laws while sensitive to individual rights. He also asserted that the state has no reason to shut down a site such as Google, remarking that both the search engine and YouTube may have merely been experiencing technical difficulties. Group Captain Somsak asked the online community to be wary of unsubstantiated claims and for any questionable information to be reported to the NBTC via its hotline 1200.

With its politically powerful union and near monopoly on power generation, state-owned IEC offers its 13,000 employees the kind of job security others can only dream up as well as salaries nearly three times the national average. But Google Israel, which joined TheMarker’s rankings only in 2012 and was No. 2 in each of the two previous years, offers generous pay and benefits as well as a more challenging work environment. And Google was not alone; high-tech companies held four of the top 10 places in TheMarker’s 13th annual survey. The rest of the top 10 was rounded out by two defense companies (Israel Aerospace Industries and Elbit Systems), a bank (Leumi), a drug maker (Teva Pharmaceuticals) and a food company (Strauss Group). Some of the findings in TheMarker survey are to be upended soon. The survey, which was conducted with the business-intelligence firm BDI, included tens of thousands of people, including employees at 70 companies, college students and human resources executives.

Close The results were submitted by the end of last year. But since then IAI has been ensnared in an embarrassing police probe into corruption and Teva saw its CEO, Erez Vigodman, step down in the face of harsh criticism of his management of Israel’s flagship company. Bank Hapoalim may have fallen three places in TheMarker’s survey to No. 11 after a report that the bank had paid a female employee not to publicize charges of sexual harassment she had made against former CEO Zion Kenan. One indication of how confident Israelis are in their jobs and their careers comes in a parallel survey BDI did for TheMarker. It found that more than a third of people surveyed had asked for a raise in the past year, up two percentage points from the year before. Among all employees surveyed, just 13.3% thought they had reached their maximum earnings potential at work. Not surprisingly, only 8.7% of respondents under age 35 thought they had topped out, but even among people age 46 and over only 17% thought they had reached their pay potential. Women were less likely to believe they had maxed out (11%) than men (15%). Some 92% of Israelis said they were proud to be working for their employers, a drop from 97% the year before. But 34% said they were looking around for another job outside the place they worked, up from 27.5%, the survey found. Wix, which provides online tools to build webpages, enjoyed the biggest rise in the employer rankings for 2017 – a giant 21-place leap to No. 38. Unilever Israel suffered the biggest fall – 17 places to 55 – which was probably due to its failure to properly deal with products infested with salmonella. No one became ill as a result of the oversights, but the company’s reputation was harmed. Government ministries were rated the 16th best place to work in TheMarker’s survey, putting them ahead of most banks, Bezeq and tech companies like SAP. Although base pay is relatively low, civil servants enjoy generous benefits.

Getty Author Copy Created with Sketch. By Sarah Rense May 7, 2017 The new Google Earth, launched in mid-April, is gorgeous. In intricate 3D, it can dive into Hawaii's volcanoes and circle Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. It comes with stories too, from outlets like Sesame Street and the BBC, and an "I'm feeling lucky" option. It's almost as good as taking a vacation. Almost. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Nat and Friends, which digs into Google technology, made an explainer for how Google Earth becomes the behemoth of topographical information available to all users, and it's a huge undertaking. Satellites collect 2D imagery, which is laid around the globe like an orange peel. The 3D imagery, however, is gathered via airplane, similar to how Google Street View cars grab photos from the ground. The images are overlapped, pieced together to show depth, and covered with texture. Google Earth is apparently composed of tens of millions of images, which Google tries to update once a year. Those updates show deforestation and development in action, as well as the loss of coastal lands along oceans and changing ice patterns to the north. They can also spot shipwreck graveyards, which is cool.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Everything is working normally for me. :) Corbin Davenport Me too, I was lucky this time. JD By normal you mean SNAFU? Dallas King Another day, another Google screw up! Jayson Stephenson The words "Google" and "Broken" are becoming very common together now. I'm not even surprised anymore.

Bill Perrotta What in the world are you are talking about? Supposedly this happened a day ago and I didn't even notice it. Everything is normal right now. Scofabear Is anyone having issues with Google now weather cards showing the wrong location? Amit_N Seriously.. on weekend? Why are Googlers working on weekends? Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Now and Play Store broken due to tests for some users Newsby Edgar Cervantes4 hours ago 24 257 27 Are things not acting properly when using Google Now or the Google Play Store on your Android device? You are not alone. Reports of issues have been spreading across the inter webs and it seems they come as results of server-side tests. Server-side tests are a way for Google to slowly release new features. They roll improvements out to a select amount of users, making sure everything is working properly. Then they can continue with a complete launch. It’s always nice to be among the first to see something new… except when it isn’t. For example, this time the server-side tests are breaking two of Google’s most important Android apps. The Google Play Store issue is causing the homepage to show blank. This is not a huge issue, as you can still search, install and update apps, but it is definitely an annoyance. Things are a little more serious with the Google Now discrepancies. Cards are malfunctioning, causing an error message to appear in the main screen, as opposed to your valued information. Affected users have also found this can be fixed, though. Some claim a simple Google Search Data clear will do the job. Others have resorted to uninstalling updates and re-updating. Are any of you experiencing these issues?

Patterson encored the event last May with a personal 16-minute history, chronicling his days as a wrestler in high school and college and a math major at UCLA, followed by a job at Hughes Aircraft and four decades at Berkeley. From writing two books with Stanford University's John Hennessy to chairing the Computing Research Association, Patterson told the audience that a key to his success was doing "one big thing at a time." His next big thing could be enormous. Rather than hitting the beach after retirement, Patterson joined Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) in July to work on an ambitious new chip that's designed to run at least 10 times faster than today's processors and is sophisticated enough to handle the intensive computations required for artificial intelligence. It's called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), and Patterson has emerged as one of the principal evangelists. He spoke to about 100 students and faculty members at the Berkeley campus on Wednesday, a few days shy of the anniversary of his retirement celebration. "Four years ago they had this worry and it went to the top of the corporation," said Patterson, 69, while sporting a T-shirt for Google Brain, the company's research group. The fear was that if every Android user had three minutes of conversation translated a day using Google's machine learning technology, "we'd have to double our data centers," he said. Google parent Alphabet already spends $10 billion a year on capital expenses, largely tied to data center costs. And now it's addressing what it calls a "renaissance in machine learning." Deep neural networks, or computers that are modeled to learn and get smarter over time as data sets get bigger and more complicated, require big breakthroughs in hardware efficiency. Patterson, who gave the same talk at Stanford on Thursday, was among the lead authors on a report from Google last month on the TPU's performance. The report concluded that the TPU is running 15 to 30 times faster and 30 to 80 times more efficient than contemporary processors from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The paper, written by 75 engineers, will be delivered next month at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture in Toronto. The report was Patterson's debut project at Google. Once a week he treks down to the Mountain View headquarters and twice a week he works at the company's office in San Francisco. He reports to Jeff Dean, an 18-year Google veteran and head of Google Brain. It's not Patterson's first Google gig — he worked there while on academic sabbatical from 2013 to 2014. This time, he joined the TPU project as a distinguished engineer, a year after the chips were first put to use in Google's data centers and just two months after his retirement party. Not really a retirement Patterson has never been one to sit idle. In 2013, while still teaching, he participated in a powerlifting competition — and set a new California state record for his age group. "Now that I think back, there was no evidence for the assumption that he was retiring except that it was called a retirement celebration," said Mark Hill, a PhD student of Patterson's in 1987, and one of the speakers at his party. Hill, who now chairs the computer sciences department at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said that in computer architecture Patterson is "on the short list of the great ones of the last half of the 20th century." He called the computer architecture book that Patterson wrote with Hennessy the field's most influential textbook of the last 25 years. Google says the TPU is being tested broadly across the company. It's used for every search query as well as for improving maps and navigation, and it was the technology used to power DeepMind's AlphaGo victory over Go legend Lee Sedol last year in Seoul. But don't expect Google to compete in the semiconductor market against the likes of Intel and Nvidia. Outside developers who want the sort of performance that Google's processors can offer have to turn to the company's cloud computing service and products like TensorFlow, an open-source software library for machine learning workloads. Read More "They're much better at building tools for themselves than for others," said Chris Nicholson, co-founder and CEO of deep learning start-up Skymind. "They've never really succeeded as a hardware company and I don't see them pursuing that strategy." At least one start-up may be trying to fill in the gaps where Google won't tread. Several engineers from the project have teamed up with investor Chamath Palihapitiya to form a mysterious start-up called Groq . It's still very early days for the TPU. Thus far, the processor has proven effective at what's called inference, or the second phase of deep learning. The first phase is training and — as far as we know — for that Google still counts on off-the-shelf processors. But Google is famous for keeping quiet about its most cutting-edge projects. During his speech at Berkeley, Patterson was asked what's next for his team. He didn't take the bait. Patterson said that one thing he's learned at Google is that, unlike in academia, he's not allowed to talk publicly about future products. "I can say that Google isn't resting," he said. "It seemed like it was a good experience. They didn't give up. Nobody got laid off."

You can only have a good start, monitor performance over time, and continue building your online brand from there. For this, you need to be adaptive to the latest trends and technology that affect your niche. More importantly, you need to be equipped with analytics tools that can help you make data-driven decisions toward growth. Today, Google Analytics is undoubtedly the most popular analytics platform you can use to obtain actionable insights. Apart from SEO, it can also provide you with useful data for conversion rate optimization. Without further ado, below are four ways to boost your website’s conversions using Google Analytics: Look at Your Traffic Sources to Identify Key Objectives In the new Google Analytics interface, you can view your traffic sources by going to Acquisition > All Traffic > Channels. Here, you can see an overview of where your visitors come from, how long they spend on your site, and how likely they are to convert. By understanding these figures, you can prioritize objectives based on what will generate more results. For example, if you receive a 2 percent conversion rate from your Facebook acquisition channel, but only have less than a thousand sessions per month, then launching an ad campaign to boost brand awareness and social media traffic is a great way to bolster your website’s overall performance. Get to Know Your Audience Preferences Apart from identifying key objectives, understanding your audience is also a prerequisite to creating better web content. This time, head to the Audience menu and search for three important pieces of data: your audience’s location, age, and gender breakdown. Knowing their location will allow you to launch cost-effective paid ad campaigns that utilize geo-targeting. Knowing their age can help you determine the platforms and content type they prefer. And lastly, knowing their gender will let you tweak your content style and brand voice. Search for Pages Stuck on Google’s Page 2 Everyone knows that most search users never check the second page of Google. This is why you should focus on pages that are stuck at position 11 or higher. Google Analytics can help you find these pages by going to Acquisition > Search Console > Queries. Before you can access the queries report, you need to enable search console data sharing first. You can refer to this post from Google to learn how. Once active, enable the Advanced filter option and filter the results to show only the pages that have a ranking of greater than 10. The next step is to prioritize these pages in your on-page optimization strategy. Unlike link-building, the steps for on-page optimization are platform-specific. WordPress-powered sites, for example, can start by installing the Yoast SEO plugin and reviewing your landing page’s content. Magento sites, on the other hand, require steps that deal with common SEO problems such as duplicate content. Monitor Your Landing Pages Your landing pages are where all the conversions happen. To start monitoring their individual performances, go to Behavior > Site Content > Landing Pages. In the landing page reports, you can either focus on pages with the highest bounce rates or those with the lowest conversion rates. Look at common performance factors such as page loading speed, CTAs, and site layout. Or if you prefer to skip the number crunching, you can use a heat map tool like Crazy Egg to visually observe how users respond to these landing pages.

The 62-year-old launched an expletive-ridden tirade at Nova FM host Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald on Monday, after the prankster sent a fake intern for an interview. 'I'll get square with these pricks' he promised, furious that Nova staffer James pretended he didn't know about the 2GB veteran's career achievements. Furious! 2GB host Ray Hadley launched a furious tirade at Nova host Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald (pictured) on Monday, after the prankster sent a fake intern for an interview After being sent in to the shock jock's office with an earpiece, James was told to repeat statements made by Fitzy. Ray sat with his arms crossed and head downcast throughout, clearly disgruntled by James's cheeky first question. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Grape stuff!

The radio personality then looked shocked the youngster didn't know how important he was. '35 years? Wow!' replied James. 'Your superannuation must be pretty big?' 'How long have you been in radio for?': Nova staffer James (left) posed as an intern and soon annoyed radio veteran Ray by asking basic questions about his life and career An unimpressed Ray declined to answer that question, and later reached breaking point when the 'intern' suggested he give Uber driving a try for 'a bit of extra cash.' 'One of the things you have to do in media James, is research your interview subjects,' he said bluntly. 'So if you would Google "Ray Hadley" you'd find the history of my life.' Do you know who I am? With Fitzy talking to James via an earpiece, Ray became frustrated and told the Nova staffer to 'Google how many ratings we've won' With Fitzy in his ear, James then left Ray frustrated by telling him that he had some ideas for his show.  'Have you Googled how many ratings we've won on the Ray Hadley morning show?' he asked, before adding: 'It's 103!' James suggested a segment called 'Working Hard Or Hadley Working?' which would see Ray doing someone else's job for a day. 'Working Hard Or Hadley Working?': With Fitzy in his ear, James then left Ray frustrated by telling him that he had some ideas for his show  'We've got a thing we use here, it's called the shredder, so we'll put that to one side,' responded miserable Ray. After hitting on Ray's daughter and offering up the segment idea 'Working Next Door To Alan [Jones],' he finally realised James's prank. 'I don't know how to say this, but this is obviously a f**king gee-up,' he barked. 'Who sent you here, because this is too ridiculous!' 'We've got a thing we use here, it's called the shredder, so we'll put that to one side': Ray swiftly dismissed James's bizarre suggestions for radio segments James then hinted that Nova FM could be responsible for the joke. Frustrated, Ray asked: 'Are you suggesting those two knuckle-heads "Wiffy and Flippy" are responsible for this?' James told Ray that Fitzy was speaking in an earpiece, prompting the 2GB star to lean in and yell: 'Fitzy, you're a f**kwit!' He then told the fake intern: 'And you're a p**s poor actor!'  'This is obviously a f**king gee-up': After hitting on Ray's daughter and offering up the segment idea 'Working Next Door To Alan [Jones],' he finally realised James's prank  Eventually, Ray found some humour in the prank, telling the Nova hosts this would be good exposure. 'I hope this is going live to air, because this will get the boys the best publicity they've ever got!' He then shook James' hand, but declined to offer him the intern role, before insisting 'I'll get square with these pricks!' 'I hope this is going live to air, because this will get the boys the best publicity they've ever got!' Ray eventually saw the funny side, as Fitzy cackled with laughter in the Nova studios  Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Elderly woman with two dogs body slammed, thrown into pool Couple spotted getting amorous on Sydney's Bronte Beach Terrifying moment an EEL is removed on the operating table King Charles III teaser trailer sees the current Prince reign Presidential candidate Marine Le Pen seen leaving Mayor's house President elect Macron says he wants to unite torn France Van driver tries to dangerously ram cyclist out of the way Moment a street vendor is beaten in the Bronx suffers skull fracture Model filming an underwater shoot is BITTEN by a shark in U.S 'I wish they didn't let you in the country': Woman tells Muslim Moped gang break man's leg trying to steal bike in shock robbery Kate Thornton sends her condolences to Zoe Ball on BBC Radio Two Macron, 39, threatens to be tough on Brexit after...

Source: Reddit "They're just f---ing with us now, surely." Malcolm Turnbull might be thinking the same thing as the top comment on Reddit, after he was wrongly identified as "Australian Prime Minister Brian Trumbull" in a monumental gaffe by venerable news agency Reuters. The global news wire quickly retracted the mistake, but not before a Reddit user had screen grabbed the evidence and gleefully posted it online for posterity. Librarian of the internet Google also indexed the latest butchering of Turnbull's apparently not straightforward name. The 'Brian Trumbull' gaffe has been indexed by Google. Source: Google Reuters had been reporting on Turnbull's recent trip to the US, where on Friday he met Donald Trump on board an aircraft carrier in New York. It was Trump and Turnbull's first face-to-face encounter, a far more intimate affair than a reportedly disastrous telephone call between the pair in February this year. That conversation – reportedly labelled by Trump as "the worst by far" of a series of calls to world leaders after his election victory – kicked off the humorous and curious dismantling of Turnbull's name in Washington. In February White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer twice called the prime minister "Mr Trumble", as he tried to answer inevitable questions from press about that fractious phone call. Mr Turnbull in the US to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, in which US and Australian naval and air forces fought the Japanese Navy. Source: AFP Predictably and immediately Australian social media users erupted in delight with waves of memes profiling their newly named prime minister. Astonishingly, Spicer called Turnbull "Trunbull" the very next day. "We have a tremendous amount of respect for the people of Australia, for Prime Minister Trunbull," Spicer said at the time. This morning the screen grab of the offending Reuters paragraph was the top post on Reddit. Tiffany Trump mistakenly calls the Australian leader and his wife "Mr and Mrs Turnball". It was later corrected (right). Source: Instagram "I love it. I really do. It's the age old tactic of intentionally f---ing up someone's name to maintain social dominance. I find it hilarious that it's being used in the political spectrum," user aMongrel wrote. Further investigation into the desecration of Turnbull's name in the US uncovered yet another misspelling on Tiffany Trump's Instagram feed. President Trump's daughter, who attended last weekend's 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, spoke glowingly of meeting Mr and Mrs Turnball at the gala event. Like Reuters, Tiffany's mistake has also since been corrected. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 Politics Buzz National Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 32 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares177 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. Jay In my case, I created the account for my kid just to reserve the name so that by the time he's old enough he doesn't have to have [email protected] I also use it to write to him so he's got emails from me throughout his whole life that he can go back and read one day. Finally, though the email address is his name, it's *my* account until I choose to hand it over, therefore it's not violating any guidelines or terms since I'm over 13 and the other info on the account is mine. Rather than add "his" Google Account to my family account, what I'm hoping Google will do is allow me to transfer "my" other, existing Google account to him now under the family account. You're using semantics to make it seem like he's using an account he shouldn't have against the rules, and that's not the case in my situation. SBBH I've done the exact same thing and also wish Google would make this work with existing emails. Violet There's also the fact that in order for an Android phone to work, you have to have a Google account. So, if your kids get phones before they're thirteen, there's going to be some fudging of birth years during setup. SBBH Yep, not sure why they've waited so long to address this when for years now every kid has had a phone and because of that an email address. I know there are administrator and guest accounts or something like that (can't remember the exact names) in Android but I've found it often doesn't work as advertised or the older phones simply don't support it. I think the government also needs to update the laws a bit when it comes to this. IMHO AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

Unable to use my GSuite account for their Family Plan let alone Family Link. jj14x Gsuite - "A set of intelligent apps including Gmail, Docs, Drive and Calendar to connect the people in *your company*, no matter where in the world they are." Not saying it wouldn't be a good thing, but given that GSuite is designed to be a product for work, don't be surprised if it doesn't really materialize Alan Cramer My GSuite was obtained back when it was Google Apps for your Domain which one of the suggested uses was for families....over the years the focus has dropped off as they focus more and more on their pay for product. Infamous_Elsa It still needs app restrictions and website blocking like iOS Tired_Guy I have maybe an unusual situation but likely not and I did bring it to Google's attention but... My son is 25 but IDD and is like a big 5 year old. He does not yet have a legal guardian, but seriously, he will forever be a minor. I set him up a gmail account for his tablet and because many social services ask for one and it's nice to let him have one of his "own". The mail comes to me anyway. He gets music off the family plan google play and Red and we can keep his music and video choices separate from ours. Having an account means we can set him up on a new device pretty quickly at least as his favorite stuff goes. But a lot of what FL offers is stuff I'd love to be able to do in one place rather than doing it all ad hoc. Trust me, if I die, his mom isn't going to deal with the hows and whys of managing his account, access, email, browsing etc. And yes, app restrictions would be such a bonus as the existing stuff out there really sucks and I'm constantly getting the kid off the password screes and back to his video because he his something he shouldn't have. But beyond COPA and age 13, tere are a ton of parents like me with adult children who are disabled who'd love to be able to allow their kids internet access while managing it for them.

Lo's dress inspired Google Image Search? TRUE FACT. By Hannah Orenstein May 8, 2017 Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Jillian Rose Reed arrived at the MTV Movie & TV Awards in a plunging, printed green gown that I have already printed out, framed, and hung on my wall as inspiration for a tropical vacation. In other words, she looks amazing. Getty If the Awkward star's dress looks mighty familiar, we figured it out for you. You're probably thinking of the dress Jennifer Lopez wore to the 2000 Grammy Awards. See? Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Jennifer's Versace gown is so iconic, it has its very own Wikipedia page. And if you can believe it, so many people looked up information about the dress that Google launched Google Image Search as a result. "[Google users] wanted more than just text," Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt explained in 2015. "This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards, where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that, well, caught the world's attention. At the time, it was the most popular search query we had ever seen. But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: J­Lo wearing that dress. Google Image Search was born." Jennifer's look obviously still holds up after 17 years, but Jillian is giving her a serious run for her money. Way to go, girl. @jillianrosereed pulled off some serious @jlo vibes on the #MTVAwards red carpet 🍃 A post shared by MTV (@mtv) on May 7, 2017 at 4:01pm PDT Hannah Orenstein is the assistant features editor at Seventeen.com.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Everything is working normally for me. :) Corbin Davenport Me too, I was lucky this time. JD By normal you mean SNAFU? Dallas King Another day, another Google screw up! Jayson Stephenson The words "Google" and "Broken" are becoming very common together now. I'm not even surprised anymore. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing. I must share with you a job wherein all of tools is actually alloted to you and also it is a relatively easy in addition to really easy work. Not necessary to build your personal website domains and many more., all will be presented to you 100% free. Visitors definitely will browse the landing page so you are going to get compensated for that. Its as simple as that.

Bill Perrotta What in the world are you are talking about? Supposedly this happened a day ago and I didn't even notice it. Everything is normal right now. Scofabear Is anyone having issues with Google now weather cards showing the wrong location? Amit_N Seriously.. on weekend? Why are Googlers working on weekends? Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

May 8, 2017 9:11 Sponsored content from Appboy 0 When it comes to marketing, things are always changing—but in the last year or so, things have REALLY changed. Last year alone, we watched augmented reality break out with the rise of Pokémon Go, saw web messaging enter the mainstream as web push became available on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, and witnessed Facebook bolster OTT marketing by throwing open the doors of its Messenger platform to third-party brands. But even if your brand has built a strategy to take advantage of all these new technologies and tools, it’s no time to rest on your laurels. 2017 has already been packed with new trends in marketing and we expect more to follow. Not all of them will reach their full potential. Some may fizzle out despite early promise. Even so, it’s important for marketers to keep an eye on emerging martech and tactics. After all, while it’s impossible to predict the future, it’s still essential to plan for it. To help marketers stay current and keep ahead of emerging technologies and tools, we’ve put together a list of five emerging marketing trends to watch (and maybe embrace) as we navigate 2017. Take a look! 1. TVOS, VOICE ASSISTANTS, AND OTHER EMERGING PLATFORMS When it comes to digital platforms, mobile is still king. But while mobile looks to be the dominant way brands engage with their customers for some time to come, we’re increasingly seeing other, mobile-compatible platforms emerging as potential marketing tools. Connected TVs are on the rise Television is poised to emerge as a platform, with brands looking for ways to reach customers on their TVs using Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, and other set-top devices. Auto-focused customer communication and user engagement via Amazon Echo, Google Home, and other in-home assistants are also attracting a lot of attention. Expect to see notifications in some form on at least one of these platforms by year’s end. 2. THE PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC EXPERIENCE Starting at last year’s editions of WWDC and Google I/O, we’ve seen Google and Apple taking steps to reduce the difference in experience and any friction between mobile apps and websites, as well as between mobile devices and desktop and laptop computers, in order to provide users with an increasingly seamless experience across platforms. These changes, including Google’s launch of Android Instant Apps and Accelerated Mobile Pages(AMP) initiatives, and Apple’s expansion of popular iOS features (including Siri and Apple Pay) to desktop, reflect an emerging view of what users want from their digital experience—namely a single, continuous, platform-agnostic user experience, instead of one that treats apps and websites (and smartphones and desktop computers) as walled gardens. Expect to see that dream come closer to fruition as more brands take steps to embrace cross-platform user profiles and begin leveraging the tools that Google and Apple have made available. 3. EFFECTIVE USE OF CUSTOMER LOCATION AND SEND-TIME DATA The arrival of mobile revolutionised marketing makes it possible to collect more (and more detailed) data on customer preferences and behaviour than ever before, supporting intimate, personalised customer-brand relationships on an unprecedented global scale. As technology advances, we’re poised to see that data collection—and the customer engagement tactics that data makes possible—become even more nuanced and effective. The growing popularity of wearables like the Apple Watch and fitness devices from Fitbit, Jawbone, and other brands, has the potential to kick off a new wave of body-focused customer data tracking, while the ever-present nature of mobile devices and massive reach of Google and other major tech brands is making it easier to track when a customer is at home or at work, as well as when they’re walking, driving, bicycling, or standing still. This type of granular data has the potential to make tools like send-time optimisation even more effective at assessing ideal delivery times, and could support a level of message personalisation surpassing what’s possible today. Look for forward-thinking brands to start collecting and using this kind of customer information in their user outreach throughout this year. 4. SMARTER AUTOMATION LIKE CHATBOTS AND AI When people think about artificial intelligence, there’s a tendency to jump to visions of an apocalyptic Skynet-like future where machines have replaced all human activity—or to a futuristic utopia where smart robots have replaced all the human activity we find annoying to deal with. But while either of those futures is likely to be a long way off, expect marketers to more effectively leverage the increasingly smart automation tools that have been emerging. The H&M chatbot on the Kik platform Chatbots have already become a memorable way for brands to interact with customers on OTT messaging platforms, but there’s still a lot of room for growth, especially as AI allows these bots to engage with users like two people having a conversation, instead of a digital version of an old-school phone tree. A similar trend is taking place in mobile-focused marketing platforms as marketers are increasingly given tools that take advantage of advanced automation and predictive analytics to more effectively reach customers. Look out for tools like send-time optimisation joined by other smart automation features. 5. POINT OF SALE AND REAL-WORLD DIGITAL EXPERIENCES While a truly seamless user experience in today’s mobile-first world will require eliminating the silos between different platforms and devices, it’s also going to mean reducing the distance between the real world and users’ digital experience. That’s not going to happen overnight, but look for companies more closely connecting their brick-and-mortar locations with their mobile and web experiences throughout the rest of 2017. Facebook Messenger Code example (Source: The Verge) That could mean integrating point-of-sale data into their digital marketing platforms to allow for digital engagement based on purchases made in person, more sophisticated location-based marketing using Wi-Fi or beacons (if beacons end up actually happening), or following in Snapchat and Facebook’s footsteps by creating visual codes that can trigger app opens or website visits when users view them with their smartphones.

Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Underlying the festivities at Warren Buffett’s annual bash for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders over the weekend was a sobering fact: Finding the next big thing is hard. The Berkshire chief executive officer spoke at length Saturday about his failure to pounce on opportunities in tech stocks, the challenge of lining up large deals, and his frustration with a cash pile that’s approaching $100 billion. “We shouldn’t use your money that way for long periods,” Buffett said of the cash during his meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “The question is, ‘Are we going to be able to deploy it?’ I would say that history is on our side, but it’d be more fun if the phone would ring.” It was a notably downbeat moment for the billionaire, who’s spent the past five decades snapping up businesses and stocks. His investments transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile maker into a conglomerate with insurance companies, manufacturers, retailers, utilities and a railroad, as well as an equity portfolio valued at $135 billion. With thousands of adoring fans watching live (and many more streaming video online), Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger took questions for five hours from the audience, analysts and journalists on topics from investing to public policy. Buffett, 86, said the Republican health plan that cleared the House of Representatives was sure to help the wealthy, and the billionaire reiterated his view that society needs to do more to help people he called “ roadkill” because they get left behind by capitalism. The Berkshire CEO also took another swing at hedge funds. Most of all, the billionaire expounded on his company and investments. Buffett said Wells Fargo & Co. mishandled its response to a fake-account scandal. And he predicted that Berkshire could make “a fair amount” on its recent airline investments if carriers keep a stronger grip on fares, while acknowledging “it is no cinch.” Apple, IBM For years, Buffett and Munger have told investors that the company’s size would be an anchor dragging down performance, only to defy their own predictions. But some missteps are now underscoring their warning. Buffett recently scaled back an investment in International Business Machines Corp. and said that he was too optimistic about the company’s prospects in 2011. Berkshire has been piling into Apple Inc. in its latest technology bet. The moves prompted a broader discussion about whether Berkshire had dropped the ball in a sector that’s come to dominate the ranks of the world’s largest businesses. For most of his career, Buffett avoided technology stocks, saying the companies were outside his expertise. On Saturday, however, he issued a mea culpa for being too late to spot their potential. Companies like Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. don’t require the large sums of capital that were required to sustain the giant industrial firms of an earlier era, Buffett said. In hindsight, he said he could have been quicker to spot Google’s potential. Berkshire’s auto insurer Geico was an early customer of the search-engine firm, and its founders consulted him around the time they were taking the company public. ‘I Blew It’ “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” Buffett said his analysis on Apple differed from IBM, in part because the iPhone maker is more of a consumer-products company. Munger said the Apple investment was a good sign. “Either you’ve gone crazy or you’re learning,” the vice chairman told Buffett. “I prefer the learning explanation.” Steve Wallman, a money manager based in Middleton, Wisconsin, who’s been attending the meetings for more than three decades, said the remarks illustrated how Buffett and Munger are “fallible, thoughtful, and aware of how much the world has changed.” They went through “a litany of trends they missed, mistakes they made,” Wallman said. “I’ve never seen them exhibit so much vulnerability.” ‘Foot to the Floor’ Buffett also expressed frustration on the acquisition front, saying Berkshire hasn’t put its “foot to the floor on anything for, really, a very long time.” The comment prompted an exchange with Munger, who said he thought Berkshire could now entertain deals up to $150 billion. That would represent a giant leap for the conglomerate. Its largest buyout was the 2010 purchase of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for about $34 billion. It’s not for a lack of trying. Buffett said Saturday that Berkshire and 3G Capital were each prepared to put $15 billion into a bid by their Kraft Heinz Co. for Unilever this year. The offer was pulled after the consumer-goods giant rejected the proposal. David Rolfe, who manages about $6.8 billion including Berkshire shares at Wedgewood Partners, said he wasn’t surprised that Buffett is bummed out by the growing cash pile. Stock markets have been rising for years, making it harder to find attractive investments. ‘Cash Problem’ “A run-of-the-mill bear market could certainly solve the cash problem” by offering opportunities for Buffett, Rolfe said. Berkshire gained 2.4 percent this year, trailing the 7.2 percent advance of the S&P 500 Index. Buffett’s company said after markets closed Friday that first-quarter operating profit slipped 4.8 percent to $3.56 billion, as insurance units faced claims from a cyclone in Australia. The stream of earnings is a growing challenge. The company’s next CEO may have to allocate far more capital than Buffett ever did, the billionaire said Saturday. That will involve deciding how much to deploy to Berkshire subsidiaries, takeovers and stock picks while also considering whether to return funds to shareholders. Buffett, who hasn’t publicly identified a successor, doesn’t pay a dividend and rarely repurchases stock, arguing that he can do better by retaining earnings. But investors pressed him about whether the record cash pile would force him to rethink his approach. “At a point, the burden of proof really shifts to us, big time,’’ Buffett said. “There’s no way I can come back here three years from now and tell you that we hold $150 billion or so in cash.’’ Watch Next: Berkshire After Buffett Berkshire After Buffett Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Nick Xenophon has supported the proposed restrictions on gambling ads and is open to changes to ownership rules but has linked the package to news organisations’ loss of revenue to Google and Facebook. The media proposals are to abolish the two-out-of-three rule that prevents a company controlling more than two of three radio, television and newspapers in an area, and the “reach rule” that prohibits a proprietor from controlling a TV licence that reaches more than 75% of the population. A spokesman for the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts told Guardian Australia on Monday that Roberts “shares Pauline Hanson’s concerns” about the package, including the two-out-of-three rule and the reach rule. Coalition to ban gambling-related ads during live sports coverage Read more “Those concerns may be able to be addressed by a conversation [with the government] as they usually are.” The spokesman said One Nation wanted to see “deep significant and long-lasting cuts to the ABC”, a demand the government has poured cold water on by saying budget savings would be determined by the public interest. On Monday the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, told ABC radio his party had “grave concerns [the government package] undermines media diversity and further concentrates an already very concentrated media market”. Di Natale said Australia needed a “strong, fierce, independent” media and maintaining a “diversity of voices” would be one of the Greens’ key principles. Asked if new technology such as internet streaming made media ownership laws redundant, Di Natale said that “may have an impact on something like the 75% reach rule” but it did not make all ownership rules redundant. “When you’re looking at [abolishing] the two out of three rule, you’ll see further concentration. “One big business will own newspapers, radio, broadcasting facilities. It can mean you’ll be in one part of the country and you only hear, through those platforms, one voice.” If the Greens opposed the abolition of the two-out-of-three rule, the government would need the Nick Xenophon Team, One Nation and three of the remaining five crossbench senators to pass it. Senator David Leyonhjelm supports the media ownership changes and another measure removing 100 sports events from the 1,300 on the anti-siphoning list. Senator Derryn Hinch said that the two-out-of-three rule and the reach rule were “anachronistic” and he agreed in principle with the package, including anti-siphoning changes. The government has promised to scrap TV licence fees in return for the networks’ support for a new restriction that would ban gambling ads from five minutes before the start of live play of a sporting event until five minutes after the conclusion of play, or 8.30pm. Australia's journalism is in mortal danger. Politicians should join the fight to save it | Gay Alcorn Read more Xenophon told Radio National on Monday it was “admirable” and “terrific” that the government had got disparate sections of the media to agree to a package that “should have happened years ago”. He supported scrapping licence fees, labelling them “an anachronism”. Xenophon said he was concerned about media diversity but what the government has proposed is “a big improvement on what they had earlier”. He promised to “sit down and negotiate in good faith with the government to get the best outcome, but I would be a mug to lock myself in at this stage”. Xenophon said there were “additional measures” that needed to be considered, because internet giants Google and Facebook received $3.2bn in ad revenue by piggy-backing off Australian media content, despite not hiring journalists. One such measure would be a small tax break for taxpayers who subscribed to emerging publications, which he said journalists and the media union would welcome. The anti-gambling campaigner and minor party leader welcomed the proposed gambling ad restrictions as a “good first step” that provided “some insulation” of children from gambling ads. He said he wanted gambling ad restrictions to go further and would work to prevent the gambling industry circumventing or watering down changes.

By Matthew DeCarlo on May 7, 2017, 10:06 AM TechSpot 22 years. 3 developers. Only 2 games. The fascinating history of the Prey series Prey is out now on PS4, Xbox One and PC. That may sound like a simple, matter-of-fact statement, but it isn’t. This is only the second entry in a series that has spanned three decades, multiple developers and publishers, and many generations of gaming technology. The Prey franchise - originally conceived in 1995 - has managed to attract attention throughout its various development cycles, but in 22 years it has only managed to produce two, wildly different entries. Games Radar Google was warned about this week’s mass phishing email attack six years ago For almost six years, Google knew about the exact technique that someone used to trick around one million people into giving away access to their Google accounts to hackers on Wednesday. Even more worrisome: other hackers might have known about this technique as well. On October 4, 2011, a researcher speculated in a mailing list that hackers could trick users into giving them access to their accounts by simply posing as a trustworthy app. Motherboard Digital Economy Act: Illegal Kodi streams could now land users in prison for 10 years The Digital Economy Act has passed into law, meaning people could now face ten-year prison sentences for illegally streaming copyrighted content. It covers a wide number of areas, including broadband speeds, access to online pornography and government data-sharing. However, amid the rising popularity of Kodi, an increase to the maximum prison term – from two years to ten – for people guilty of copyright infringement is particularly interesting. The Independent Cory Doctorow dreams of a DRM-free utopia – so he's suing the US government to get it Cory Doctorow fears for the future. Rising inequality, political instability and technological surveillance are merging to create a world, he says, in which "there are disasters - and those disasters are human-made". Most sci-fi writers might use this insight to create a dystopia, but Doctorow, 45, has been creating something more optimistic. His new novel Walkaway shows how catastrophes can create "the first days of a better nation". Wired 32 products put to the test: How good is antivirus software at protecting itself? For the third time now, the experts at AV-TEST examined a large number of the security software applications on the market in terms of their self-protection. The focus was on file protection with ASLR & DEP, which programmers can easily use – or foolhardily forget. Moreover, it was examined whether the distribution of test versions use secure channels so that attackers cannot distribute any manipulated software packages. AV-Test.org Disks back from the dead In 2012, William Parker and his colleagues went hunting for a data set that tracked the growth of more than 50,000 carefully planted white spruce trees over a decade and a 1,500-kilometre range. They found a reel of computer tape, a relatively modern 3.5-inch diskette and a box of older 5.25-inch diskettes. These contained data from field trials in the late 1970s, which were set up to improve yields of commercial timber. Nature.com Instant recall Inside Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters, the arrival of Instant Articles in the spring of 2015 was presented as a cause for celebration. Talking with reporters, executives described the fast-loading, natively hosted articles as a promising new creative format. A suite of publishing tools incubated in Facebook's now-defunct newsreading app Paper would find their way to Instant Articles, executives said, evolving the news posts shared on Facebook into immersive multimedia experiences. The Verge Making 3-D printing as simple as printing on paper If you haven’t used a 3-D printer yet, you may be surprised to learn that it isn’t fully automated the way your office’s inkjet is. With paper printers, users queue documents from a computer, and each finished sheet drops neatly into a tray, waiting to be collected. With commercial 3-D printers, however, designs are manually programmed into the printer, and each finished part is manually removed before starting a new print, which is very time-consuming. MIT How multiplayer games sync their state? Part 2 Let's start by defining what a server should do, typically a server should serve as a connection point for players. In a multiplayer game, players need to access a common endpoint to reach each other, this is one of the roles of a server program, even in the P2P communication model, there will be a connection point for players to exchange their network information before a P2P connection can be established... Cake Solutions (Part 1) The end of Steam: imagining the future of how we buy games Over the past few years, Steam has added refunds, tried paid mods (and failed), integrated virtual reality tracking technology, and soon will let anyone publish games for a fee. Meanwhile, GOG shed the original meaning of its name, Good Old Games, and built a client while staying DRM-free. Itch.io appeared on the scene and let anyone sell games for free, only taking a cut if the seller offers one. PC Gamer 234 Android applications are currently using ultrasonic beacons to track users A team of researchers from the Brunswick Technical University in Germany has discovered an alarming number of Android applications that employ ultrasonic tracking beacons to track users and their nearby environment. Their research paper focused on the technology of ultrasound cross-device tracking (uXDT) that became very popular in the last three years. Bleeping Computer Modern “Hackintoshes” show that Apple should probably just build a Mac tower Apple is working on new desktop Macs, including a ground-up redesign of the tiny-but-controversial 2013 Mac Pro. We’re also due for some new iMacs, which Apple says will include some features that will make less-demanding pro users happy. But we don’t know when they’re coming, and the Mac Pro in particular is going to take at least a year to get here. Ars Technica Researchers develop 'seeing' bionic hand with 99p camera Scientists in Newcastle have developed a cheap way of helping amputees with prosthetic limbs reach out and grasp objects - a bionic "hand that sees". The hand was developed by bioengineers at Newcastle University who modified a standard NHS myoelectric hand with a cheap camera to provide upper-limb amputees with a more functional prosthetic. Sky News Cities seek deliverance from the e-commerce boom Just before 3 in the afternoon on a rainy spring day, Keith Greenleaf busts out his “bricklaying” skills. That’s delivery-driver parlance for balancing an inordinate amount of cardboard boxes on a metal handcart. As high as his collarbone he stacks them, packages labeled HP, J. Crew, Amazon Prime. “This is probably one of the first days I don’t have Pampers or dog food,” he says. CityLab Blockbuster has survived in the most curious of places — Alaska For families across the United States, driving to the local Blockbuster Video was a Friday night ritual. The kids fought over which movies to rent, parents had to pay off the late fees and all succumbed to the popcorn and candy buckets at the register. The Washington Post It looks like Amazon’s Video app is finally coming to Apple TV this summer Amazon and Apple may have reached a truce. The tech giants, who are increasingly competing for customers’ time, eyeballs and money, are close to an agreement to bring an Amazon video app to Apple’s Apple TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the two companies.

I also need to finish adding to my Chipp budget folder, otherwise known as Keeping the Bastards Honest. In the lock-up, you need all the research material you can get, lest you forget where the bodies are buried. But today, though, here is a short summary of the goings on. The LNP senator and middle bencher Zed Seselja suggested that, if the US left the Paris climate agreement, things would change. That might mean something for Australian government energy policy or it might not. The last tidbits of budget ahead of official release included $321m for the Australian federal police and a Productivity Commission review on the banking competition. There were strong hints, via the Financial Review, on allowing bank customers to move banks more easily, ie transferable accounts. Bill Shorten copped flak for a new Labor ad for marginal seats that puts Australians first. The problem is the group of ordinary Australians looked pretty white. Anthony Albanese, who is on the national executive, said he had not seen the ad but it was “a shocker” and should not be run. That’s it from me. The blog will run tomorrow first thing and parliament will be sitting from midday. There will be party room meetings tomorrow morning. Remember Tony Abbott has already warned his leadership that he will raise his opposition to the school funding policy. What could go wrong? Good night and see you in the morning.

Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.50am EDT 00:50 The budget think pieces are coming thick and fast. The independent economist Saul Eslake has written a longer comment piece at the Conversation. He reminds readers that the “temporary deficit repair levy” will lapse on 1 July. This was the 2% surcharge on the top marginal personal income tax rate, which was the only significant taxation measure by the Abbott government. He also goes into the good debt v bad debt debate. This is the distinction that the treasurer himself has drawn, allowing him to borrow for infrastructure, without leading to the terrible outcome of the formerly known debt and deficit disaster. Eslake makes a number of points: Abbott says he was the infrastructure prime minister but spending declined on his watch. That’s because Abbott did not accept the advice of people who know stuff like RBA governor Glenn Stevens, the IMF, the OECD and others. Their advice said that, while interest rates are low, well-targeted infrastructure building is the goods. Morrison is expected to outline additional borrowing for infrastructure. Some, such as the second airport, will pass the economists’ ruler, others will not. This is what you need to know about the change in reporting of good debt/bad debt by Eslake: But the government will seek to quarantine this “good” debt from detracting from its policy and political goal of returning the budget to surplus. It will do this by focusing attention on the net operating balance or difference between revenues and operating expenses – as state and territory governments and the New Zealand government have done in their budgets for decades. Indeed, by focusing on this measure, the budget might be able to proclaim a return to surplus in 2019-20, a year earlier than projected for the underlying cash balance.

Australian veterans who were exposed to radiation from British nuclear testing will also get free healthcare in the budget, which is a long time coming. The Greens MP Scott Ludlam has been campaigning for this for years. It was a loophole that successive governments of both stripes were happy to let fly and they were waiting the men out.

Paul Karp Australia is committed to the Paris agreement on climate change “as it stands” but the nature of the agreement would “change” if Donald Trump pulled the United States out, the assistant minister for social services and multicultural affairs, Zed Seselja, has said. On Sky News on Monday, Seselja was asked about Australia’s commitment and replied: We are committed to it. We’ve put forward our targets and they are strong measures: 26-28% [in greenhouse gas reductions]. So we are doing more than our share, in my opinion. When it comes to the US’s position, that is a matter for the new US administration. Obviously you wouldn’t want to speculate but, if they were to pull out, obviously that would change the nature of that agreement. But, as it stands, the Australian government is committed to the Paris agreement. Updated at 11.30pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.11pm EDT 23:11 Straying into energy policy, Four Corners will tonight do over the general clusterduck that is energy policy in this country. Michael Brissenden reports that the lack of carbon price is paralysing the country and domestic power prices could surge because of it. Post Paris, the government agreed to the broad principle of keeping temperature rises to 1.5C by 2050. Most scientists say this means developed countries like ours will have to reach zero net emissions by 2050. But the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has told Four Corners he was less confident Australia would be able to meet that aspiration. We’ll get to zero net emissions over the course of this century. The Australian Conservation Foundation says the admission is pretty much a recognition of gross policy failure by the government. Any remaining credibility this government has on energy policy is now in tatters. It is simply leaping from one band aid solution to another like new coal and gas export controls because of its ideological opposition to power from the wind and sun. Even Snowy 2.0 if proven feasible is a longer term solution to an immediate crisis. Updated at 11.26pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.58pm EDT 22:58 Lunchtime politics Bill Shorten has been roundly condemned for a Labor marginal seat advertisement, which uses a group appearing to be mostly Caucasian Australians, to sell the message: “Build Australian first, buy Australian first and employ Australians first.” Senior Labor frontbencher and one-time leadership rival Anthony Albanese labelled the ad “a shocker” and said it was not the sort of ad his party should be promoting. Budget speculation continues over various measures including more cuts to the foreign aid budget, in order to funnel money towards national security. We already know there will be a new school funding policy, infrastructure spending off budget (think Sydney’s second airport), lifting the Medicare rebate freeze, more money for the AFP and new immigration (revenue raising) measures. Updated at 11.04pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.34pm EDT 22:34 Albo carpets Labor Australians First ad: a shocker Labor’s shadow infrastructure minister, Anthony Albanese, has labelled Labor’s Australians First ad a shocker. At a doorstop in Canberra, Albanese said the ad “should never have been produced and it should never be shown”. It is not the sort of ad I want my party to be promoting. Asked what was wrong with the ad – which appears to almost exclusively feature Caucasian people – Albanese said “anyone who sees it will know exactly what’s wrong with it”. I have no idea [what the approval process was]. I know because of Channel Nine’s exclusive – clearly it was dropped to Channel Nine to be shown last night – I don’t know what the process is. I am a member of the ALP national executive. I assure you that I hadn’t seen it. Albanese said that Bill Shorten had “said quite rightly that the ad is inappropriate and it will be withdrawn”, summarising an earlier statement from Shorten that the ad “should have had more diversity in it”.

The papers will lose one in four journalists. There will be some very familiar faces, who will not be covering the budget this year as a result of the seven-day strike. They will be sizzling sausages at 2pm and I am sure Mike Bowers will be there to record the event. Updated at 11.02pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.15pm EDT 22:15 Paul Karp has done a full take on the Labor ad minus diversity. Bill Shorten has conceded that people with more diverse backgrounds should have been in Labor’s new Employ Australians First ad, in response to complaints that it was racist. The ad, set to air in marginal seats and previewed on Channel Nine news on Sunday evening, features Shorten promising to “build Australian first, buy Australian first and employ Australians first”. The final image of the ad features Shorten with a group of 12 workers, almost all of whom appear to be white.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery.

Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess.

Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 3:28pm PDTMay 2, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 341 Share on Facebook 123 Share on Twitter Total Shares540 News Phone Reviews Pixel Pixel XL Article Contents 1 The hardware 2 Battery life 3 Display, audio, and wireless 4 Camera 5 Performance and software 6 Value 7 Conclusion I have been using the Google Pixel XL for six months now. Not continuously, mind you - I have taken breaks here and there. But after using the Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, and the OnePlus 3T, there is only one phone I've instinctively found myself returning to, and it's this one. Google's Pixel isn't without its flaws; in fact, it has a great many I can cite with ease. The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot. The fingerprint scanner is slower than what you'd find on a number of competitor devices. The value proposition is mediocre at best. The screen to body ratio pales in comparison to phones like the G6 or Galaxy S8. And you can't even buy the damn thing. Why do I keep picking up the Pixel time and time again, then? Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? The answer is consistency. In the nearly seven years I've been doing this, I have never used an Android phone that has held up so well to the tortures of time. The Pixel XL feels nearly as smooth as the day I began using it six months ago. Android glides along with best-in-class touch latency and a responsiveness that feels immediate (if not manic) and satisfying. It's not just performance, either. My battery life remains largely predictable, too, and largely very good. The camera continues to impress with its swift launches and ease of use, and it produces the most consistently excellent results of any smartphone camera I have ever used. HDR+ is easily, for me, the best smartphone camera feature out there. Oh, and even if the fingerprint scanner is a bit slow compared to some, at least the damn thing is easy to reach and reads consistently. Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today? I don't really think so, let alone $870 for the 128GB version we all actually want. And honestly, I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy. The XL offers better battery life and is far from "big phone" status in terms of actual usability - it's really the only one of the two that warrants consideration, in my opinion. With that, let's dive in to the details. The hardware Put the Google Pixel XL next to a Galaxy S8+ and you'll have a pretty hard time finding much to love about Google's phone. 2017 is ushering in a new era of smartphone design language and packaging, and the Pixel XL clearly hails from the period prior to that shift. To be fair, it did come out six months ago. But there's no doubt that from an industrial design point of view, the Pixel is aging fairly rapidly. The 5.5" Pixel XL is nearly as tall as a Galaxy S8+, but the latter has a 6.2" display. Line up the bottom of the S8's screen with the Pixel XL's, and it becomes apparent just how much more panel Samsung has managed to shove into a frame that is only a few millimeters taller. Granted, this does have ergonomic consequences (the S8+ is unabashedly more difficult to use one-handed than the XL because of the screen's height), but I think it's safe to say most of us want more screen where we can get it. I still think the Pixel XL is perfectly nice to hold and like the texture of the aluminum opposed to Samsung and LG's new glass-heavy designs. I also still believe the fingerprint scanner is in the ideal location, unlike the Galaxy S8, which has the most frustrating one in existence. The position of the camera makes accidental smudging less likely, too, and I really like the perfectly flush look Google was able to achieve with the glass window. Visible wear lines on the casing In terms of wear and tear, my XL has... not fared well. The finish on the Quite black model I have here has begun to very noticeably rub off in areas where the aluminum chassis is slightly more raised than others. You could remedy this with a skin, but I personally like this phone totally unadorned. Otherwise, though, it's held up well - the buttons are still fine and I don't notice any real physical problems with the phone aside from the aforementioned finish wear. Just don't drop it in the toilet. Battery life As I said in the introduction, it's consistently good. I always have a pretty clear sense of how much time I've got left when I'm really starting to push my XL to the limits of its longevity. If I'm having a Wi-Fi heavy day with lots of using the phone for browsing the web and texting, 5 hours of screen-on time is doable. If I'm away from home and largely on LTE, I can pretty reliably get 4 hours of screen time assuming it's not stretched over much longer than a 12-hour period. For a full 16-hour day away from wall outlets and going it on mobile data alone, 3 hours is what I generally end up managing. This probably won't impress many of you with Xiaomi, Huawei, or Exynos-powered Samsung devices, and I understand that. But the thing about the Pixel has been just how well I've been able to learn what I can expect in terms of battery performance based on the conditions I'm using it in. I know I can throw in a bit of tethering and Bluetooth streaming without completely obliterating the battery, for example, if I'm at 60% halfway through my day and won't top up till later that evening. My range anxiety with the Pixel is exceptionally low, even if it doesn't offer the very best battery life of any smartphone. Would I like the next-generation Pixels to have larger batteries? Yes, please. Relying only on software to ensure a good power consumption experience is missing half the equation (and I'm not saying that's what Google did). Stuffing even a few-hundred more milliamp hours of capacity in there can be the difference between a dead phone and one that gets you back to the charger at the end of the night. Always fit a bigger battery when you can. Display, audio, and wireless The Super AMOLED Quad HD display still looks bright and crisp, even if the new panel on the S8 is clearly a cut above the part Google is using on the Pixel. Even so, I think the screen is one area where the Pixel XL earns its $770 keep, as there really aren't many phones out there you're going to find which are considerably better in this regard unless they have "Galaxy" inscribed on the back. On the audio front, I found the Pixel's bottom-firing speaker mediocre at the time I reviewed it, and I find it mediocre today. Sadly, it's not getting much in the way of competition, either - both the G6 and S8 have speakers that are at least as unimpressive, if not worse in certain respects, and I hope Google can at least give us that quasi-BoomSound using the earpiece speaker on the Pixel 2 this year. The headphone jack offers performance in line with most Snapdragon 820-series devices and thus isn't the best candidate for pushing your high-impedance cans, but I find it perfectly serviceable in the gym even at high outputs. The quality is there, even if this generation of Qualcomm parts didn't offer as much power as audiophiles probably would have liked. One of my biggest gripes about the XL is its Bluetooth performance. I have used three separate Pixel XLs, and all of them have absolutely terrible Bluetooth signal. Even think about touching the phone in the wrong spot, and the music stream to your headphones or car will cut out. It is absolutely obnoxious. It doesn't matter what kind of headphones, speaker, or car A/V unit - it sucks with anything I've tried. Even walking around with the Pixel XL in my pocket connected to a pair of Bluetooth headphones results in cuts every single time I step up a stair or rest my hand against the pocket the phone is in. The 7.1.2 patch has done nothing to alleviate this issue. It's borderline embarrassing: I have had the Pixel XL corrupt the Bluetooth profiles on my car three times. Each time, the only solution was to factory reset the infotainment unit. I had to factory reset my car. No other phone has ever done this to me, though since the 7.1.2 update this hasn't happened - yet. Wi-Fi performance, on the other hand, has been quite excellent for me, and LTE signal is at least as good as most other phones I tested in 2016. Now that I'm on Verizon, I'm even getting some HD voice calls, which is such a huge upgrade in terms of the call experience. But seriously, Google: get the damn Bluetooth right next time. Camera I can't stop taking pictures with the Pixel. I love this camera. No more words: just photos.     Performance and software Aside from the aforementioned Bluetooth problems, you know what I find so wonderful about the Pixel? I rarely really get annoyed using it. Apps load up at consistently quick speeds, the OS always feels snappy and responsive, and the touch latency is positively iPhone-y. Like your finger is truly controlling the elements on the screen. The home button and back key respond lightning-quick, in a way that almost starts to make them feel like real buttons. I struggle to really convey how right Google got the basic "interacting with the phone" stuff here. What they managed to do with the Pixel will only make the Pixel 2 that much better a phone, and I will be clear: I do not feel this way about the Galaxy S8. The Pixel feels incredibly natural and pleasant to interact with. There are still hiccups, delays, and little areas where things just don't feel as smooth and seamless as they should on the S8. Google nailed this. No other phone I've used has. Is the Pixel as fast in a straight-line speed sense as a OnePlus 3T? No. But counting fractional differences between the number of seconds it takes to load an app or how long before it's pushed out of memory are not methods that convey an experience. They tell you a couple of very specific things under a controlled circumstance. In practice, I simply find the Pixel the most consistent and smooth Android smartphone I've ever used. But, it does have some usability issues. For one, my 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks basically once a week, necessitating a reboot. I use this when in the car, and so it's very, very inconvenient when this happens. Rebooting the phone takes a good minute-plus, and then it has to reconnect to my Bluetooth (which is never guaranteed to work). This is probably something to do with the Google app, but it's annoying nonetheless. Other than that? I struggle to find anything about the software that I really dislike. Most of my frustrations come down to third-party apps, not the Pixel. And those are annoying on any phone I use. Value When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No. The successor devices to the current Pixel family will be unveiled in the next five or six months. There is absolutely no good reason to shell out what, with tax, amounts to nearly a thousand dollars for this smartphone. You will absolutely regret it the moment Google announces the Pixel 2 - I guarantee you. Do not buy a Pixel right now. In fact, I'd say just don't buy a Pixel period anymore, we're just too close to the next iteration for that to be remotely sane advice. Conclusion So, that's weird, right? I can't even recommend that you buy what is easily my favorite Android smartphone currently on the market? What kind of long-term endorsement is that? That's because for all its problems and limited availability, the last six months I've used the Pixel have utterly proven to me that Google is capable of building a smartphone that, from a user experience standpoint, rises above the competition. Google's unmatched ability to optimize the way Android and the underlying phone parts interact is very much a reason I love this phone so much. A smartphone should get out of its own way when you use it - it should be an effortless canvas upon which your fingers and eyes naturally engage and interact. That means it should be fast. It should be consistent. And it should just feel right to use. I know that some of these things don't really translate well into concrete assessments, but there's something about the Pixel that really just works for me so well. It's as close to my ideal smartphone as I've ever been. I'm hoping that Google smoothes over some of the rough edges not just with the phone, but with the whole experience of buying and owning it. Why is is to hard to buy a Pixel? It's positively ridiculous just how bad Google has been at keeping this phone in stock. I also think it's hard to ignore that in 2017, the Pixel's design language and overall look and feel are clearly behind the competition. This looks like yesterday's smartphone, and even on the day it was announced it was kind of hard to really fall in love with in an aesthetic sense. At best, it's just kind of boring. Post-purchase experiences should improve, too. Google's online and live chat support are very-just-OK, and what I've heard of the RMA process hasn't been super reassuring - full price credit card holds and iffy-quality refurbished replacements. Of course, that's what happens when you're in the online-only phone sales business. Still, Google should be working to streamline defect, warranty, and accidental damage claims in a way that makes it feel like the nearly-thousand dollars you spent on your phone is going into supporting a thousands-dollar-phone experience. They really also need to stop making crappy cases that are obscenely overpriced. Google made a great phone when it built the Pixel. Now Google needs to be a great phone company. I'm curious to see if they can pull it off. Tags google pixel long term review google pixel review pixel long term review pixel xl long term review subscribe ...

I shouldn't buy the best phone you've ever used. David, you are hurting my brain! David Ruddock you really shouldn't though Jeff Beck Well, Pixel 2, hurry up and get here then. My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days. Just can't bring myself to overlook the Samsung FP scanner or I might have settled for an S8. Tr3ple I'm warming you don't do it. I settled for a s7 edge after my 6p, big mistake OhYeah! I made that mistake with the Galaxy S3 and then the Edge 6. Both were disappointing and much worse than my Pixel XL. I love the Pixel! Dean L I got used to my S8+ fingerprint scanner after about a week. I absolutely love the position now, and never touch the camera anymore. Carson Saldanha Throw in free banana splits and you've got a deal! ;) Rickinbsb pick 2 Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days." I see people say all the time that it's Samsung phones that always get slow over time. Intellectually dishonest people, I guess. sweenish They can both be right, you know. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, I believe they're both right, depending on various factors. My Note 4 is running better than it did with Lollipop, and a little slower than it did with KitKat. It probably has at least something to do with the Android version and what apps you install on it. My point was that it's intellectually dishonest to pretend it's a Samsung problem, as if it's unique to those phones. And that's how the people frame the problem. sweenish And you were just framing it as "not us, but them." Not better. If I misread your intent, I apologize. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You did misread my intent. No problem, though. Treeburgerface It's Android that's the problem. Some Android phones get slower than others. Some Android phones lag more than others. But eventually they ALL get slower and they ALL lag. I've heard 1000 people swear that Android is "silky smooth" and "fixed" now over and over again, before "project butter" and long after and it's still not true. It's certainly improved, which you should expect with the 3 Ghz 12 core processors and 8 GB of RAM they are packing in them now, but at this point I kind of doubt Android is ever going to be quite as flawless in the GUI department as other OS's which were designed to prioritize touch input and treat the users finger like God they way they should and which prioritize reliability over ultimate capability. Just depends which set of sacrifices you are more comfortable with. Ismail Akram Well that totally sum up a perfect phone for me :) Just add Powerful AMP in that Ghisy This, times a million! And also a cheaper, not overpriced XL with at least a 5.7" screen. Then Google can have my money. Meanwhile, I'll be keeping my Nexus 6P. Rod "My 6P is losing longevity and running super slow these days" I don't get this. How is it running super slow all of a sudden? Did you fry half of your board or something? My 3 year old phone performs exactly the same way as when I first unboxed it. Try running in safe mode, because there's probably a rogue app in your end.

Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore............. David Martrano I'll take my edge over the pixal Any day. I've never had the loss of a Bluetooth connection. Plus there always backordered. I tried to purchase back in December and Google told me I had a 60 day wait. I said OK and moved on. When you lose consumers to me that's not good business! Either have them in stock or lose money! senor_heisenberg It's a Google product, so I'm not even surprised. Just a weird company. ericshmerick Yesterday: don't buy this POS Today: I love this phone lulz Daishi And in both articles he said not to buy the phone. It is advice. He explained himself quite well with several caveats. His point is valid. There is no real reason anyone should buy this 6 month old phone for its introductory price, even if the phone had no flaws. Bob Thank you. Rod You should. However, you'll need to time travel back to the launch day. Tr3ple Incoming triggered Sammy fanboys.... OligarchyAmbulance "WUT?!?! What do you mean your Samsung lags? Mines *never* lagged! It runs as well as the day I bought it, you *obviously* have a defective unit!" username_not_valid I feel the need to factory rest a device several times a year anyway, Samsung or not. David Martrano Totally agree, my edge has never lagged. Purchased over a yr ago. Just as fast as the day I bought it. Plus with the Nouget update even better! deadpenguins My fiance's gs7 is less than a year old, yet it *constantly* lags and hangs up. She has to restart it at least once every few days and has to charge it twice a day even though she barely uses it! See how useful anecdotes are? OligarchyAmbulance Woosh Jermell Howard Jr Lol funny and true but lets be hone st Google in the Smartphone world is like France and Samsung is like the U.S. Jeff Beck I'm not sure who that comparison favors. Jermell Howard Jr The U.S is a world superpower and France is not. Samsung is much bigger in terms phone market share Winston But Samsung doesn't have a loud CEO who tweets in all caps during his morning bowel movement. Jermell Howard Jr 😂 ok? King_Android 😂😂😂 xyz Yeah, they just have a better education and healthcare system, and higher quality of life statistics. But America does have a lot of big, shiny bombs. I'll give you that. Marty Nah, still not biting. Me no like HTC. "I have a hard time seeing the point of the smaller 5" model at $650 right now, that just feels like lunacy." I'm one who prefers a smaller phone. Had Apple included an FHD display on the 4.7" iPhone 7, I'd be sporting one with a Cheshire Cat grin. RyRyTheFunBun I think that Apple did the right thing by sticking with just an HD display on the 4.7. Good density with less of hit on battery. But if they wanted to make the phone thicker.. rockon999 I just bought one. Honestly David, 6 months is a long time to wait to buy a new device (Pixel 2). My Moto X is done for and I wanted a good phone. What can I say. At least I don't use Bluetooth and don't mind cases... Paladin27 I just bought one... 4 weeks ago and got it yesterday. Great timing on these two articles, AP. :-/ BUT, My Nexus 6 is dying and I needed something new. I weighed the options, my wife even has a G6, but I'm glad I got the Pixel XL, and besides, it will be 8 months before anyone actually has a Pixel 2 in their hands. whispy_snippet I wouldn't worry at all. Both of you. You got what in my book is still the best phone you can get. Not the best in every single way, but the best in the ways that are arguably the most important. JDC Great article @rdr0b11:disqus. Fair and balanced. I feel the same way about my Pixel. I also have the fun time of explaining to friends and family why my Pixel is the best Android phone I've used BUT they shouldn't buy one. I personally can't wait to see what improvements are made to the Pixel 2. mwolverine I have an OP3T, and one thing i don't get is how is the user experience on the pixel superior? Both are running nearly stock Android and are very consistent. Tr3ple You'd be surprised how much better the Bexel XL actually is compared to the 3t. Granted the 3t is the best bang for the buck out there. Duder12 It's more fluid and smooth. What don't you understand? Ismail Akram Have you used Pixel for yourself for month or for a week? I had OP3(not T) and came to Pixel XL. One thing very obvious to me when switching was smoothness between the two. Pixel animations feels more natural. and scrolling feels so smoother, its not massive difference and normal users can't even tell the difference, until he have used so many phones. then Software update thing is really awesome on Pixel. Camera is best for me on Pixel. Display is also great. In term of looks I prefer OP3 more. well IMO if Pixel have better design it would be even better for me. BTW I hear people have a lot of issues with OP3T touch latency which OnePlus improved but not gone. people don't even notice these latency things until they use phone with less touch latency. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Given that you admitted many (but not all) of it's faults, if that's the best phone you've ever used, you've set the bar incredibly low. crackcaffeine You sound like you know a lot about this topic. What is the best phone you've ever owned? Inb4 Note 7 Grahaman27 "It's the best smartphone ever but don't buy it!" Which half of this is bullshit? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Neither, if you read and understand the context. Grahaman27 A new phone probably launching in 6 months (that we know nothing about) is not a valid reason to not recommend buying a phone. Tr3ple It's an opinion you know? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman If that were the only reason he stated in the article, I might agree with you. Again, read and understand the context. MJ Did you consider reading the article and trying to understand the words? David Martrano That's like saying do as I say don't do as I do! Suicide_Note I'm just grateful i haven't experienced any issues with the Bluetooth on my XL. Keith Stefanec Me neither. Sean Me either CF542 You guys are lucky. I'm on my second Pixel and still have Bluetooth issues. Not as bad as the first unit but still a problem. Love the phones​ though Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I frequently see comments by people who say they're on their 3rd or 4th Pixel. It makes me wonder how many of those 2.1 million Pixels HTC shipped are replacement phones. David Martrano When the day comes when they sell 50 million pixals, please let me know. It's a great phone for a limited audience! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Limited audience" -- I couldn't have described its fans better than that. Tom Takumi Okamoto Google should buy OnePlus to improve them as a phone maker. NexusKoolaid How did that work out for Motorola? Tom Takumi Okamoto Not well. I don't think Google wanted to be a phone maker at that time because the Nexus program was still on. If I'm not mistakin it acquired Motorola just to protect Android from lawsuits. Knowledgeborn Allah The entire basis of your argument kind of falls apart when you admit that you can't recommend for anybody to buy it, and I think that's because of the Pixel's main problem: it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable on Android's current platform. The fact that it'll be DOA by 2019 just makes it worse. Could I recommend that people buy the Pixel XL right now (if they could get their hands on one anyway)? Nope. Could I recommend that OnePlus 3T? Yes, definitely! The S7 Edge, which is OLDER than the Pixel? Yes! There was even an article I read today with reviewers STILL recommending people to buy the iPhone 6s Plus to save money, and that device came out 2 years ago! When compared to those devices, the Pixel just doesn't hold up, which is why I don't think anybody would recommend it today, only 6 months after its release. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017. HTC has shipped about 2 million since it was released over 6 months ago. 'nuff said. whispy_snippet Can you provide references for these assertions? OligarchyAmbulance The reference would likely be his anus. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google "htc shipped 2.1 million pixels". For comparison purposes, Sony shipped a total of 5.1 million Xperia phones in Q4 2016. And that was a drop of 33% year over year. whispy_snippet That's not a reference. That's some words inside double inverted commas. Tr3ple https://www.google.com/amp/m.gsmarena.com/google_has_already_sold_21_million_pixels_report_says-amp-24270.php whispy_snippet Thanks for this. But it only states the amount of Pixels sold, being 2.1 million. I haven't seen a reference where Google officially states "they expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." A statement like this sounds like horse shit to me. There's no way Google would be foolish enough to make a specific target like this available to the public. In other words, Felonious Monk is almost certainly bull shitting. Again. Tr3ple He wasn't bullshitng lol http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20161006VL200.html whispy_snippet "Sorry, the page you are trying to open is available only for our paid subscribers." Tr3ple pocketnow.com/2016/10/06/google-pixel-smartphones-4-million-sales-forecast whispy_snippet Are you even reading the articles you're referencing? Once again, nowhere does it say Google "expected to sell 3 million by the end of 2016 and 7 million more in 2017." He's bull shitting because that's what a bull shitter does. Tr3ple Google never said that, that's your boy up there paraphrasing. Either way they predicted the phone to sell quite a lot. And it is. whispy_snippet He's not paraphrasing. He's manipulating information, being deliberately misleading, and bull shitting. Completely. Tr3ple "Digitimes Research's Taiwan Mobile Device Tracker - HTC's handset shipments are expected to reach 6.5-7 million units in the second half of the year, up less than 10% from 5.8-6.1 million units in the first half." whispy_snippet So is the digitimes research device tracker establishing projected figures based off their own analysis or from direct statements from Google and/or HTC? OligarchyAmbulance So you know how many phones Google expected to ship because you made it up and it's now a fact? lol Alright, buddy. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Authority: "Report: Pixel shipments could hit 4 million this year" (2016) "Morgan Stanley: Google on track to sell 3 million Pixel devices in 2016, 5-6 million next year" Google it for yourself. Randy Gindy Googled. Found several sites that reported Pixel sales already being 2.5 million. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Cool. No sources, but I'll trust you. Maybe by the end of 2017 they'll hit the projected sales target for the end of 2016. Randy Gindy Where were your sources? Randy Gindy Xperia is a pretty well known brand already in several markets. The Pixel brand hasn't had much exposure aside from the couple models of developer oriented Chromebooks and Tablet. I wouldn't assert that because an established brand sells better than a brand that just really started that it makes it a bad phone. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Xperia is a great example of a failing phone in the US, at least, which is why I used it as a comparison. "You may as well pretend Sony doesn’t exist in the U.S" https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/why-sonys-xperia-phones-keep-failing-in-the-us/ Randy Gindy It maybe a failing brand but it is established. Tr3ple Just shut it, ill recommend a pixel over all these phones you mentioned, s7 egde won't get anroid P, I can guarantee you that. Until you've owned and used a pixel XL you shouldn't comment on it. tim242 It is HTC trash. Tr3ple Yeah we get it, you don't own one. tim242 Why would I? Hardware issues galore. Not to mention, the stock problem. Tr3ple Lol as i thought, move along. tim242 Deflect much? It is well documented trash. Tr3ple Hahahahahaha, like I said move along tim242 You can't deny it, so you deflect. You must be a trump worshiper. Jeff Beck Well, that escalated quickly. Richard Dennis Yea... yea.. we know you're here you're queer get used to it.. Next! Safe circles, safety pins, and pink hats for everyone.. (Paid for by the government of course) tim242 Damn str8! Knowledgeborn Allah Fanboyism at its finest... The Pixel is not a good buy compared to any of those phones, and I DO have the Pixel XL. I know from experience that it's overpriced, underpowered, and unsustainable with Android's current system. 🤦🏾‍♂️ The S7 Edge probably won't get Android P... And? Based on the chart just released (scroll up), most other Android devices probably won't get Android P either, at least not until "Android R" is out. Lol! Tr3ple Judging by what you said I doubt you have a Pixel XL. Yes it's overpriced, just a lil. If somebody don't care about the price, yes pixel is definitely a better buy Knowledgeborn Allah What kind of sense does that make? It's a "better buy" if you don't care about the price? 😳 Like I said, it's overpriced for what it is. Tr3ple yes plenty of us don't care about the price, it makes plenty of sense. Pfft Knowledgeborn Allah The idea of being a "better buy" contextually includes the price. The fact that the Pixel is overpriced for what it is automatically means it's not a good buy. And again, that's coming from somebody who bought the XL variant at launch. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The OP3T and Axon 7 are much better buys. Knowledgeborn Allah Absolutely! Tr3ple No, the idea of "better buy" is a combination of EVERYTHING. Software, camera, build quality, reliability etc.. and let me tell you that the pixel is in fact t the better buy, only phone on that list I think MAYBE might be a better buy is the 3T, but the camera and battery life are ok not great, but for the money yes. Knowledgeborn Allah Yes, everything, INCLUDING the price. Again, the fact that it's overpriced means, contextually, that it's not a good buy. This shouldn't be that hard to understand. whispy_snippet I don't think it's over priced at all. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't think it's overpriced, being identical in price to the iPhone? I've heard other people make that claim, and yet they believe that the iPhone is overpriced... What's your view regarding this? Do you think the iPhone is overpriced? What does something being overpriced mean to you? whispy_snippet I guess I should rephrase. It's not over priced when compared to what it's competing with. "Over priced" is a bit of a relative term. It doesn't hold a lot of meaning. What is over priced to one person might be a steal for another. I think you can make the argument that compared to other phones the Pixel, iPhone and Galaxy S8 are all expensive. But over priced? That's a murkier discussion. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think status plays a role in pricing when it comes to other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple both have established brands, and people are willing to pay top dollar for their devices because they've already proven themselves. Google isn't in this same position in the smartphone hardware department. Also, I'd say that both lines - e.g. Galaxy S series and iPhone - offer much more in the way of unique features and premium hardware than what Google offers with the Pixel. But that's just my personal perspective... whispy_snippet See that's where I'm not so sure. The Pixel still has the best camera of any smartphone and an amazing display to back it up. Straight away it's hit two areas out of the park that matter to most people. At launch it had a class leading SoC that continues to offer great performance. It has plenty of RAM. Rock solid build quality. A super fast and accurate fingerprint sensor. USB-C (remember the GS7 didn't which was Samsung's 2017 flagship) with fast-charging and excellent battery life. It has the most capable voice assistant. It's got the latest version of Android and what I believe to be the best overall user experience for most people - it's consistently fast and smooth, unlike anything from Samsung, and will receive timely updates for much longer than the competition. The Pixel is the iPhone of the Android world and I think it has a market to fill. Do I think the Pixel 2 needs to be better? You bet. No one is denying this. What phone doesn't need to be better than its predecessor? If the Pixel 2 doesn't at least have waterproofing and a higher display-to-bezel ratio critics will hold them to account. But I'm pretty sure these features are a guarantee. The thing is, and I've said this elsewhere, I don't really consider a lot of the hardware bells and whistles we see from the likes of Samsung all that meaningful. The curved display is a gimmick. It looks great, but I'm not at all sold from a functional perspective. The same with the new 18:9 ratio. For a mobile device I consider one handed usability important. Reaching the notification pull-down with one hand is already a no-go on the GS8 and its fingerprint sensor is another ergonomic mis-step. And a heart rate sensor? Who on earth uses this? Same goes with its iris-scanner and face recognition. Why use these options when a well positioned fingerprint sensor is more convenient? It's all just guff. Bullet points for carrier salespeople to sing about in store. I think waterproofing is a biggie though. Google can't drop the ball here. I also think wireless charging is going to become significant if Apple introduces it to their new iPhone. We've seen Google offer wireless charging in the past and then take it away because, well, I don't think that many people really cared. But I sense the tide is going to turn on this. Google's phone is priced the same as the iPhone and Galaxy S because it's being positioned as a premium product. I hate the word "premium". It's huge BS when you really think about it. But ultimately this is the strategy Google is taking with its new phone. A high margin, high performing, premium flagship for the masses. I think the best of the Pixel line is yet to come. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think the Pixel launched with a lot of good qualities and features, and that's why I rushed to purchase it. However, around the same time, I bought an iPhone 7+, just to give iOS a fair shot. Now that I've used both devices, I think it's a huge mistake to call the Pixel "the iPhone of the Android world". In reality, it doesn't even come close, and that's where the problem comes in. The iPhone is Apple's primary device when it comes to sales, but it can almost be seen as an accessory to other Apple devices, like the Mac and the iPad, etc. The Apple ecosystem allows all their devices to work together seamlessly through Continuity, and this is something Android can't replicate (at least not at this point in time). The Pixel may look similar to an iPhone, but it definitely doesn't function like one. And yes, I know that Samsung (and carriers) puts a bunch of bloat on their devices, showing off features that many people will never use. The difference, though, is all about opportunity and selection. Samsung built an entire brand around giving their consumers more than they'll ever ask for, and that's what keeps those customers coming back. I don't know anybody who uses that heart-rate sensor on the back. When I see it, I think, "Why wouldn't they remove that and use the idea of the heart-rate monitor to sell more Galaxy Gear smartwatches?" I just didn't get it... But, hypothetically, if somebody ever ends up in a situation where they need a heart-rate monitor, Samsung has them covered. I learned that firsthand when my nephew was taken to his school nurse due to an asthma attack, and the nurse didn't have a heart-rate monitor in her office. Her assistant pulled out his Galaxy S7 Edge and used the heart-rate monitor on there to relay it to medical services when they arrived. I know, that would be a generally rare occurrence, but it happens from time to time, enough for people to consider what would happen if they didn't have it. Personally, I don't think Google has enough "skin in the game" at this point to really charge that much for the Pixel. Apple and Samsung have proven brands in the smartphone space. Tech reviewers giving it high marks isn't going to matter too much among average consumers, because most people just aren't interested in technology to that extent. They just want something that works, and works reliably. Google hasn't demonstrated the ability to make hardware that just works reliably (unless you count the Chromebook Pixel line, which most people didn't buy either). It's always better to start at the bottom and work your way up, than to start at the top and get knocked all the way down. Sean Everyone on here KNOWS you dont have a Pixel or a Pixel XL......but troll on......... Knowledgeborn Allah "Everyone on here" knows what I have? Seriously? You're an idiot. 💩 Knowledgeborn Allah I find it quite funny that anybody who criticizes the Pixel is automatically labeled a troll, a hater, a sheep, etc. How ridiculous! ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After Marshmallow, I stopped caring about new Android versions. I'm almost afraid to get a Nougat phone, given there have been so many problems with it. As for O and P, I'll let you Pixel users alpha test it and then decide if I care about getting it. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 I actually bought the Pixel XL mostly because I've had every Nexus device since the Nexus 4. I thought it would be a great device, but I was disappointed. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not worth the price. And, to be honest, I haven't really used it consistently in months. I use it occasionally to access the Google Play Store, but that's about it. My primary device nowadays is an iPhone 7+, and it's miles ahead of the Pixel XL in almost every way. Alex Louderback "DOA by 2019" is a contradiction, my friend. Knowledgeborn Allah If we're talking about release timeframe, you're right. But there's a big difference between when a device is released and when it's in the hands of the consumer. Last time I checked, the Pixel XL variants are still out of stock, even though nobody's buying them. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman DOA means "dead on arrival," which was Alex's point. It can't be DOA by years from now. Knowledgeborn Allah That's cool and all, but that's not a counter argument... OK, maybe "DOA" wasn't the best terminology, but the points still stand. The device, today, 6 months after its release, is still too flawed to recommend. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Stop comparing it to an iPhone. No other Android phone should be purchased six months after its release either. Only iPhones have that status because they have no competition within themselves. Within Android, after six months, there's another king of the hill. But I wouldn't recommend a Galaxy six months after its release, or ANY other model of Android phone. Knowledgeborn Allah "Stop comparing it to an iPhone"? 😳 Google released the Pixel devices to directly compete with the iPhone! If they can't do that, then why are they matching it in price? If the product is devalued already, then Google needs to drop the price. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Put a fake button on the huge chin and it would look exactly like an iPhone. That's no accident. Sean You and Knowledgeborn Allah should have a troll off competition.......... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because your point has NOTHING to do with the Pixel, and EVERYTHING to do with Android as a whole. The reason the Pixel's not a good value proposition at this point is because it's competing against all other Android phones, which together are competing against the ONLY iPhone. You can't compare them in this regard. Period. Also, there's no point in comparing them because if I wanted an iPhone I'd own an iPhone. I don't. In which case I'm determining the best Android option. Right now, someone who isn't buying an iPhone, shouldn't buy a Pixel. That has nothing to do with the iPhone and everything to do with the competition in its own space. Knowledgeborn Allah That's not true. Every Android device isn't designed to directly compete with the iPhone, but that's exactly what Google tried to do with the Pixel. So, yes, they can definitely be compared. Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Android, as a whole, is designed to compete with the iPhone. While the Pixel has to compete with both the iPhone AND all of Android. "Just because the Pixel doesn't stack up doesn't mean that it shouldn't be compared." You're not reading or comprehending my words if THAT was your takeaway from what I said. Not bothering anymore. Knowledgeborn Allah Android as a whole? Android is an operating system. Its rival is iOS. You're positioning the platform as if it's completely one-sided. The iPhone has to compete with various Android devices too. It just happens to have an ecosystem of hardware to aid it along the way. You're acting like an Android OEM can't do the same thing if they put in time and resources. Based on the fact that Android manufacturers are only pushing out hardware components for smartphones (and occasionally tablets and smartwatches), I'd say their biggest competitors are other Android OEMs, not Apple and iOS. For the record, the LG G6 wasn't designed to compete with the iPhone. It's competing with the Galaxy S8. The HTC 10 was competing with the G5 and S7. It's never been an Android vs "Apple ecosystem" thing on the manufacturing level. The only OEMs who actively try to compete with the iPhone are Samsung (S and Note lines) and Google (Pixel line), and it looks like Huawei is just starting to build up their consumer base in the West to do that too. The others are generally competing against other Android OEMs. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Your first paragraph made my entire point for me: Android manufacturers', including Google, biggest competitors are one another, *not* Apple and iOS. But ANDROID's biggest competitor is iOS, which has only ONE device line: the iPhone. The Google Pixel, while it may have been designed as Google's attempt to battle the iPhone, doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's still ALSO doing everything from the first paragraph: competing against all other Android manufacturers. No matter how much Google may *want* to break out of that, their wants are irrelevant to reality. And the reality is that the Pixel is one of many Android phones, all of whom are competing against one another, the sea of which is competing against the iPhone. So how well the Pixel stacks up against the iPhone isn't relevant, as it's not the focus of this article or the reasons for David's position. WITHIN the Android ecosystem, it's simultaneously the best Android phone he's ever used (same here) and not a good idea to buy it right now BECAUSE OF THE REST OF ANDROID and NOT for any reason having anything to do with the iPhone. For anyone who wants to buy an iPhone, which is a massive number of people, there is absolutely no competition, allowing them to charge anything they want. For anyone who wants Android, there's an endless sea of competition, making the Pixel's price and specs within the refresh cycle a much harder sell right now. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The headline is, "Google Pixel long-term review: Still the best smartphone I've ever used" not the best Android phone. I assume he meant Android phone, though. Still all smartphones compete with one another. And if the Note 8 is disappointing, I'll definitely consider getting an iPhone 8. Because the best smartphone (for what I want and need) is what matters to me, not the best Android phone or even the best (insert OEM here) phone. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. We have different priorities, which is fine. I couldn't use an iPhone. Apple products and their ecosystem don't fit my needs. So I'm looking at *only* Android phones. So it's entirely a matter, at any one time, of what the best *Android* phone is. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought I couldn't use an iPhone, too. But I've used an iPhone 6S Plus now, and it's really quite a good phone. Even the display is better than I thought it would be. And that's quite a compliment coming from someone (me) who will never use anything but AMOLED. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have to use them for my clients sometimes. They're fine. They work well. I'm still too embedded in Google's ecosystem in ways that don't make switching feasible. Knowledgeborn Allah I get your point... I still think there are certain ways around that, especially considering Google's vast amount of resources. But yes, I see how that could definitely be a problem. They could still salvage the Pixel line, though, by providing standout features like Samsung does, or by undercutting their competition with their pricing like OnePlus does. I think either of those could work fairly well. The notion of putting standout features in their devices could be a challenge, since their devices pretty much serve as a template for Android as a whole. Undercutting the competition would be easier, and that's what Google actually did for years with the Nexus program. I think that's the big "bust" factor for them. If the Pixel could be purchased for $450-500, it would still be a good purchase even now, just like the OnePlus 3T. But it's really hard to justify paying $800 for the Pixel while the Galaxy S8 and G6 are on the scene. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They already went for standout features. They made a big push to be more "opinionated" with several software and UI customizations, along with their big hardware push. The difference is a huge number of the Galaxy standout features just aren't that compelling. That's the sort of stuff they skipped. Knowledgeborn Allah When I mentioned standout features, I was talking about exclusive ones. The Pixel doesn't really have any. They marketed the phone as having the "best camera on a smartphone", and that's turned out to be a debatable subject among people depending on their perspectives - whether they like realistic colors or oversaturated photos. The Google Assistant is now available on pretty much every Android phone, just like the fingerprint scanner gestures. The hardware from the front looks strikingly similar to the iPhone -which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it leads people to question why they should get an iPhone lookalike, when they can get the real iPhone for the same price. The display is decent, but it's not even as good as the one on the Galaxy S7. Google ditched stereo speakers for a mediocre mono speaker. Pixel Imprint is noticeably slower than the fingerprint sensors on many cheaper offerings. The Pixel launcher was all the rage, until pretty much every third-party launcher started adding many of its features into their custom launchers. To make matters worse, the device is almost always completely out of stock online and unavailable to purchase through carriers. And those are just basic factors. Add to it the fact that Google just published an EOL report for the Pixel, solidifying the point that it'll stop getting Android OS updates in less than 2 years from now, and people are going to say, "F**k that!" That's why, personally, I think they should drop the price and salvage what's left, unless they really don't care about selling them. whispy_snippet Price and value are not intrinsically linked with "premium" products. You don't just drop the price on a product you're trying to position as high end because it's gotten a little older. You're only going to tarnish its reputation. A major reason why many people buy high end premium products is BECAUSE they're expensive. Marketing 101 mate. Phones are modern day status symbols. I remember when the Pixel launched some people scoffed at the price and said "well I'm just gonna wait for Google to discount it in a few months". I tried to tell these people that it wasn't going to happen and that the best "bang for buck" time to buy the Pixel was actually launch day. And here we are, months later, and the Pixel is still being positioned as a high end premium product. And believe me, it'll still be priced at the high end right up until the Pixel 2 launches. Apple have long been the masters of pricing their products at the high end of the market despite cheaper alternative offering features that savvy buyers demand. But look how well Apple has done. Billions of dollars in the bank thanks to sales in a product often considered a step behind the cutting edge. If you want a cheaper phone with certain features important to you, get one. There are countless options. But give up on the idea of a cheap, affordable Pixel. It's NEVER going to happen. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not disputing that. You're correct in saying that many people buy high end products because high prices give the illusion of inherent quality. The problem, however, is that the Pixel is competing against the iPhone, and it hasn't worked. In fact, it can't and won't work. There aren't any Android OEMs who can realistically compete with Apple. They may design devices that compete with the iPhone, but they can't compete with Apple. Why? For starters, continuity. When you buy a Pixel device, you're buying a product. When you buy an iPhone, you're buying into the Apple brand and ecosystem, where all their devices, ranging from the Apple Watch to the Mac to the iPad, iPod Touch and Apple TV, and even AirPods and Beats wireless headphones, all work seamlessly together. Secondly, you're buying into the Apple Store and it's customer service benefits. Thirdly, you're buying into Apple's update cycles, which come directly from Apple to all their devices instantaneously and average around 4-5 years of support. The list goes on and on. Google isn't naive. They have their own ecosystem, but it's centered around their software and services, which you can get on practically any device. They don't have a hardware ecosystem. They knew what they were getting into, and they took a chance by trying to compete directly with the iPhone in pricing. They also see that it's clearly not working, so it's time for them to adopt a new strategy. If they actually want large groups of people buying their devices, which I'm not entirely sure they do, they either need to have standout features like Samsung Galaxy devices (which they don't), or they need to lower their prices. Right now, lowering the price on the Pixel is the only way they can salvage it. whispy_snippet I disagree on many levels. You don't establish yourself as a hardware company overnight, and you don't establish a product's premium reputation overnight. Yes, Google doesn't have the same hardware ecosystem Apple has at this stage. But they've now got skin in the game that matters most - phones. All of the products you listed from Apple don't come close to the significance of the phone. Many will never own an Apple TV, a MacBook, or Airpods. But almost everyone owns a phone - and we don't know where hardware is going to take us next. Maybe in a few years time tablets will be dead, everyone will be using hybrids and home assistants will be one of the most important gadgets in our lives. Who knows? The point is just because Google doesn't have the same suite of products as Apple doesn't mean they won't one day, or that they won't be the company that leads the pack in the hardware that matters tomorrow. Further to this, just because the Pixel lives in an ecosystem different to the iPhone doesn't mean it can't be a success in its own right. Google is known for its class leading services. What happens if it starts gradually making these hugely important and much loved services - like Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Photos... even Google Search - Pixel exclusives? It sounds improbable - almost impossible! But it serves as a reminder of how powerful and influential Google is in the services EVERYONE uses, Apple customers included. Google entered the hottest fight in consumer tech and delivered a hugely impressive smartphone on its first attempt. It wasn't perfect, but it bettered the competition in a number of important ways. Who knows what Google has in store for the Pixel 2, 3 or 4? They're in this for the long haul. You can't expect the Pixel to sell like the iPhone and Galaxy S in its first, second or perhaps even third iteration. But as time goes by, the Pixel will stand shoulder to shoulder with Apple and Samsung's best in the minds of the average consumer. There's too much at stake for Google to sit this one out. Knowledgeborn Allah I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing? The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment. In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money. The Nexus program was more popular than the Pixel, even though there was far less advertising for it, because Google implemented a strategy of undercutting their competition. They probably thought that meant people just loved their devices and decided to launch a "premium" product. In reality, one of the main selling points of the Nexus line was its affordability. The Pixel doesn't have that, and that's why it's not selling. Again, they need to undercut their competition in pricing, or they need to implement standout features that are exclusive to the Pixel. I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now. whispy_snippet Maybe grab yourself a cup of tea... “I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying Pixel can't be a success. It definitely can be, but Google needs a better strategy to make that happen. When you're competing against a company that has a structured, proven hardware ecosystem that seemingly locks users in, you have to do something extraordinary to break them out. Samsung is doing that by releasing groundbreaking smartphones. OnePlus is doing that by undercutting flagship devices via pricing. What's Google doing?” But is Samsung making ground breaking smart phones? Is Apple? No one is doing anything especially impressive at the moment. A larger display is a nice to have, and I've no doubt everyone is going to follow this trend, but it's not what I'd call “ground breaking”. The same applies to hardware features like wireless charging, stereo speakers, or dual cameras. All nice to have, but merely extensions of core concepts of how we use our phones. So what? I think Google has a unique edge through its ability to leverage its vast swathes of data and machine learning to create personalised services that no one else can. They’ve been leading the game in key areas of software and services for many years now. That’s not to say Google is perfect of course, but take mobile photography for example. With the Pixel, Google was able to enter the phone market and best the competition first go through software expertise. And look at Assistant. It’s way ahead of Siri despite Apple getting the major head start. Google Chrome is the leading web browser. Google Maps is the leading mapping service. Google Search is so dominant in our lives that it spawned the phrase “just Google it”. Smartphone hardware has just about reached conceptual maturity but software and services are absolutely ripe for further innovation. And if I had to bet on which company has the greatest potential to revolutionise this space I’d bet on Google. Not Apple, and definitely not Samsung. “The idea that Google has leverage because of their services is naive at best. Google isn't going to make their services exclusive to the Pixel or its brand because they make too much money from their portals. If they restricted YouTube to the Pixel, everybody would switch to Vimeo or something else, and Google's stock would plummet. The same goes for pretty much all their other services too. The only leverage they have is in financing, and that's very comparable to Apple anyway. In fact, I think Apple may actually be worth MORE than Google at the moment.” Of course Google isn’t going to flick a switch overnight that takes all its services away from non-Pixel users. I’m not suggesting this would be any sort of sensible strategy. But it’s not hard to see Google making certain features of these services Pixel exclusives as a first step. Let’s picture ourselves a couple of years from now. Hypothetically speaking, what if Google started giving Pixel users access to “YouTube Sports” for free? Or what if they gave Pixel users 2TB of Google Drive storage for free? Or what about unlimited uploads to Google Photos for free? ...wait, they already do this. What about exclusive access to the Google Assistant? Wait, they did this too in the launch stage of the Pixel! Can you see what I’m getting at? In the coming years, as the Pixel gains further traction in the minds of the general public, Google will be better placed to leverage its strengths and make the Pixel a value proposition no one else can offer. Imagine all of the above I’ve listed, and more, only available on the Pixel? Google has a huge advantage on the cloud service side of the equation - an advantage that I think is going to prove increasingly valuable in the coming years. “In reality, Google will never try to conquer the hardware space. Services are their moneymaker, and the more devices they can attach their web services to, the better it is for their bottom line. That's what it's really about, at the end of the day: money.

I see those as the only sure ways to salvage the disaster that is the Pixel line right now.” Google is trying to conquer the hardware space right now. Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, Google Home, the Pixel, Daydream, Chromebooks, the hiring of Rick Osterloh as SVP of hardware - there’s evidence of Google’s push into hardware everywhere. But you don’t usurp hardware empires like Apple or Samsung with the click of the fingers. This is a long game, one that is going to rage for years to come. If Google continues to develop the Pixel at the same rate it’s developing its services (and by all indications this is Google’s intention) its phone will be a formidable force sooner than you think. The unrefined, “rushed” gen-one Pixel won critical acclaim from tech sites and bloggers everywhere - for example Android Police, The Verge, and MKBHD all rated the Pixel one of the best smartphones one could buy when it launched. Labelling the Pixel line a “disaster” is as laughable as it is bizarre. Clearly it’s selling well as Google is having huge trouble keeping it in stock. And yeah, part of this is because Google is botching its supply train, but teething issues were to be expected. The message to take home from these issues is that there’s a demand for Google’s first phone. It is selling. Not at iPhone or Galaxy S levels, of course. Not yet. But anyone with a reasonable appreciation of the smartphone industry never expected it would. But I would definitely expect the Pixel 2 to sell better than its first gen sibling. Onward and upward. You’d be foolish to underestimate the second most valuable company in the world. Knowledgeborn Allah You're making some really good points... But I highly doubt Google is not trying to conquer the hardware space. They may be merging themselves into the hardware space, but dominating it? That kind of growth would eventually make them a virtual monopoly! They'd be shut down before they reached that point. There can be groundbreaking features of a device without them revolutionizing the way we use our devices. Based on your presentation, the only groundbreaking device on the market would be the BlackBerry KeyONE, since that literally changes the way someone would use their smartphone, at least a modern one. And, by the way, I'm not calling the Pixel a disaster in and of itself. I'm talking about its sales figures when compared to its competition. It's a pretty good device. I've had several issues with mine, and it's been far from perfect, but it's definitely not horrible. However, money is what matters at the end of the day. It's priced in the same range as the iPhone and Galaxy devices. Yet, it hasn't sold in numbers even remotely comparable to either of those. That's what I meant by it being a "disaster". whispy_snippet Apple has long dominated hardware. Why wouldn't Google aspire to be in this position one day? Why would Google be stopped when Apple wasn't? If Google sees an opportunity for growth that they're confident they can exploit they're almost obligated to go for it and provide returns for investors. Google may not ever reach a dominant position but I've no doubt its long term goal is to dominate. Just on the Pixel's sales figures, I'd reiterate that looking at gen one sales compared to the iPhone or Galaxy S is pointless. It really is. It's certain that many people still don't even know that the Pixel exists. What we need to keep an eye on is its growth. Will the Pixel 2 sell more than the first gen Pixel? Will the Pixel 3 do the same again? Will this growth be at the expense of Apple and Samsung market share? Just watch this space. I'm expecting it will definitely keep doing better in the years ahead. But it's going to be a fight. Knowledgeborn Allah I also think that the Pixel will see growth, year over year, at least initially. It's not going to be easy, though, regardless of Google's resources, because they're still going up against Samsung in the Android space. Personally, I think Samsung is going to crush the Android smartphone space for years to come, and there's not much Google can really do about that. The competing spaces, at least right now, are reserved for iOS and Android, and Samsung has gotten the dominant position in Android to become Apple's biggest competitor in the smartphone space. It took them years to get there, and I highly doubt they'd let that position be handed over to Google. The Pixel will be in a better position to secure the dominant position in the Android space if Samsung decides to start using their Tizen OS. Until then, Google will be fighting an uphill battle against Samsung, and they'll pretty much always lose. whispy_snippet We'll see won't we. Knowledgeborn Allah Indeed. Daishi Stop comparing it to an iPhone. Interesting point. When it comes to pricing the Pixel(s), they shouldn't be priced like an iPhone. Google doesn't have the nationwide support systems in place like Apple does. This is an argument for Apple's pricing for their phones. Why should the Pixel be priced as such without the same services??? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're at nearly the same level of services. Warranty replacement was intensely simple. Pricing is what it is. I can't argue it one way or the other. Reason was primarily to appear to be in the same class. It's psychological, and there's merit. But the entire point of this article was NOT that the iPhone is the better buy, which is why the comparison makes no sense to make. Daishi How are they at the same level of services? Of the 490 Apple stores in the world, the United States has 269 of them. Each offers not just sales of Apple merchandise including Macs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, Apple watches and Apple TVs, but service them at each one as well. This is the level of services I am talking about. Where are all the Google Stores where I can take a Pixel phone for servicing?? Google does not have this level of support anywhere in the world, so why should they price their gussied up Hold This Cat 10 phone like an iPhone??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because it was designed to look like an iPhone to make people believe it was worth what you'd pay for an iPhone. And it has G on the back. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Because, again, the warranty replacement process *without* a store is insanely simple. Simpler, since Apple generally requires you to rely on a store, and there are massive swathes of the country not near them. Also, you left out the word "nearly" to support your strawman counterargument. They're NEARLY at the same level. Also, you're lumping in unrelated things. We're talking about the Pixel, not the entire Android ecosystem. What other devices Apple supports through a store is irrelevant. And you can bring your Pixel to a UBreakIFix store for support, as well, FYI. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They're out of stock because nobody is buying them. I've seen comments about how they can't find them at Verizon stores. That's because Verizon only stocks phones that they can expect to sell. That's basic business sense. Knowledgeborn Allah That makes a lot of sense... But what about the online Google Store? Google won't even make them available to purchase online, as if HTC isn't even making them anymore. Kevin Aaronson Goddamn, those Bluetooth issues sound nightmarish. I would loose my mind! QueenLuLu So much this!!! I completely agree with this article. I currently have a Pixel, OnePlus 3T and LG G6 and despite all the great qualities the other phones have, I find the Pixel to be the most enjoyable and "complete" Android device I've ever used. And believe me, I have pretty much used them all! I want so much to love my G6 more, but it's impossicant. Better specs or no; the performance and be usability of the Pixel is awesome! I really hope Google steps up with the Pixel 2. If they did, I think it would really give this industry the kick in the rear it needs. whispy_snippet Great read as always, David. But I'm just wanting to ask some questions on the Pixel's Bluetooth performance. Is this just based off your own personal experience or have you got some data to indicate this is a widespread problem? I own a Pixel and use Bluetooth all the time. I listen to podcasts and music over Bluetooth headphones on my daily train commute, I sometimes use my portable Bluetooth speakers outside when I'm having a BBQ or a coffee on my deck, and my 2017 Subaru Impreza has Android Auto - which as I understand uses Bluetooth to transmit audio. Has there been the odd hiccup? Sure. But on the whole Bluetooth performance with my Pixel has been perfectly fine. No stutters, no disconnections, no nagging drop outs and relatively quick connection times. Obviously this is just my personal experience, but if I'm reading your review correctly, the problems you mention seem limited to your experience also. Maybe your accessories and not the phone are the main culprit? I just think Bluetooth sucks in general, personally. Taco Monster At least with my Mazda 3, my wife's Z3C is much much more reliable than my XL, which craps out a lot (see my other comment on this thread). I've found it to be okay with speakers and BLE devices like our August lock. whispy_snippet Hmm I'm a little sceptical about Mazda and their reputation for mobile consumer tech. They're still not officially onboard with Android Auto and Apple Car Play - instead they're still pressing their notoriously buggy and clunky MZD connect in-house system. I'm speculating, but they seem a bit "head in the sand" if you ask me. thetimmysmalls They recently announced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to come to most of their Mazda Connect systems... At some point. whispy_snippet Yeah I did see that. Promising. But we'll see. Brian Wolters When the Pixel first came out, it would often lock up and sieze my car stereo system to the point where I actually had to turn the car off for 2 minutes and then get it back on. It was frustrating to say the least. With the recent updates to the Pixel, I've not encountered this. whispy_snippet Nasty! What car do you have? Brian Wolters 2016 Jeep Cherokee with Uconnect. It hasn't happened since recent updates. It was so bad, I used another phone until it was known it was fixed. My name is…. Damage control??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google could draw a picture of a phone in crayon and sell it as the Pixel XL 2, charge $1,200 for it, and most web magazines would rate it the best phone of 2017. It's self-preservation. And then once you've done that, you can't admit you were wrong. That would not only be embarrassing, it would be biting the hand that feeds you. Tr3ple But do you have one Johny M It's called Appleing it. me me It's the 7 stages of grief after the Nexus 5. Wondering when the press stop writing words about the once-was-interesting Google products. Keith Stefanec Never experienced any of these Bluetooth problems that were mentioned. Single downward speaker sucks. Hopefully, the Pixel 2 will have a bigger screen like the Nexus 6. wjrandon Did you Google make you guys post this? I bet they did!!!! Taco Monster For your Bluetooth woes in the car, at least with my Mazda 3, force stopping Bluetooth Share under Apps does the trick for me. I've even set up a Tasker profile to do this automatically every 12 hours. 😤 I figured this out after resetting the car to factory settings a couple of times. Grey I think these phrasings are disingenuous. My Nexus 6P is the best smartphone I've ever used - it's bigger, it's thinner, it's faster (though I am currently sucking all the RAM out of it and it's constantly freezing up - but my Nexus 4 did that too) than my Nexus 4. That doesn't make it a phone I'm happy with. There's features missing I'd like to have. There's design choices I disagree with. Saying "This is the best phone I've ever used" doesn't at all mean "This is a great phone". Jeff Beck When you have used pretty much every mainstream Android device ever, as David has, it's not a bad compliment. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman ...it kind of does mean that, actually. Unless literally every phone you've ever used is utter crap. But considering who's writing the article, he's used pretty much everything. "Best phone I've ever used" does translate to "this is a great phone." 4Ui812 That picture is so apropos for the title of the story. (If you don't know what I'm trying to say you can ask) brenden gonzalez Loved the article David I agree I got the the pixel from Verizon pre-ordered it and got it the day before I went on sale I've recommend the pixel to everyone I know my parents switched to them my brother and sister did to and I got some friends to switch to it as well and we all love the software experience it's so amazing!! Best phone I've ever owned it's also the longest I've ever owned a phone in 2016 before the pixel came out I had 6 new phones in a year and never did I find one that I liked and wanted to stay on I've tried them all to HTC to Samsung to even apple and LG and sony and I can't put the pixel down! I can't get a new phone even after seeing the s8 I would recommend and buy a pixel any day over the S8 Plus I no like edge on screen hell no!!!!! I would break it and be mad so that phone is too breakable for me! Nigel Antonio I kinda agree, accept I haven't ever gotten any bluetooth issues, i've been in a case since day one, and I don't see wear and tear on the back panel.... I recommend this phone to everyone, but don't go buying it now unless you have an extra 1k burning a hole in your pocket then go ahead.... but I await the next version of the pixel xl 2017, should be dope. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman A few thoughts/counters, in both directions, from my own experience: 1. I have had NONE of these Bluetooth problems you described with any device, including several different headsets as well as my car. I can travel notable distances from it, work out with it, and no disconnects. BUT, I have a Pixel, not an XL. Could that somehow be a factor? 2. Warranty service, for me, was exemplary. Yes, there was a credit card hold, but I'm used to that for advance exchanges. Otherwise it was a 10-minute process via chat, the replacement arrived in two days and was flawless, and thanks to the overall Pixel backup/restore process, the transition was painless. Easiest warranty exchange ever. Also, she allowed me to decide, on my own, to skip going through a factory reset as we both felt I'd done enough of my own troubleshooting. 3. Now the bad one: my Pixel freezes on me semi-regularly. On the one I replaced it was sometimes several times a day, but on the replacement, after about two weeks of use, it's as much as once a day, as infrequently as once every two days. Full-on hard freeze necessitating holding the power button until it reboots. NOT good. Never had this happen before or anything like it on a previous phone. Clearly, if it survived the warranty replacement, it's an app causing it. But how can an app consistently freeze up the entire system to this degree? What's not preventing that? And why is there no easy way to troubleshoot that? This is really bugging me and is the only thing damaging what's an otherwise stunning, stellar phone that's my favorite of all time. Only other disappointment for me is not having an XL which is what I wanted at launch, but the store approved me for just under enough money to get a 128GB XL. I had to choose between 32GB XL or 128GB non, and 128GB was (and still is) more important to me. But I'd rather have the better battery life and higher-res screen for VR. Still, all-in-all, and especially if I can resolve the freezing issue, this is the best phone imaginable, and its limitations are nothing compared to its heights. But yeah... at this point, wait for the next one if you're buying a phone now. Toby Beveridge I have the 5" Pixel with the daydream VR headset and I don't have any issues.. the screen is good enough for me.. way better than my note 4 or s6 Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Cool. Not for me. The pixel density is a serious problem for my enjoyment. Ismail Akram I have bluetooth issues he mentioned and I use Airpods with my Pixel XL.. so I thought its Airpods problem with Android(cuz I rarely use that with iPhone) About freezing it happened to me when I was on beta but after beta I don't remember freezing on Pixel XL ( but it was annoying in the start and I was so dishearted ) I recently had to sell either iPhone 7+ or Pixel XL (so I can buy S8+) and I sold iPhone 7+ :-p cuz iPhone is so easy to get Niall Murray I have the same freezing problem. Often my phone will unknowingly reboot in my pocket too. gizak No BT issues here either and I use BT in my car and headphones daily. As for your freezing, I experienced this too... after some extensive google searching, I narrowed it down to an app or two causing it. Mainly, any older app that uses your GPS periodically to poll for your location. Check apps that use GPS and haven't been updated since the latest version of Android, they may still be accessing the GPS directly instead of asking the android system for location (the newer more efficient way). Wendy By "latest version of Android", do you mean any app that hasn't been updated to Android 7+ software? My phone has been freezing every few days or so, so I'd like to try this suggestion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Are you talking about the Pixel? I'm curious if these apps freeze other phones with Nougat. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Wouldn't this mean that every other phone running Nougat would freeze up when running these apps? Have you heard of anything like that? gizak Hmm, ya, you would think so. I'm not a code monkey, so this was just a hunch. The forums I came across linked it back to a family locator app causing the freezes and mentioned GPS access as the culprit. For me though, it was the WebMD allergy app that periodically polled my location to provide pollen count that froze my Pixel up daily. When I uninstalled it, my freezes seemed to go away. Wendy I'm getting the freezing error as well. I've requested for a replacement, so I'm hoping that will solve the issue. It's been freezing every so few days or so, not as frequent as yours. motoridersd The only odd Bluetooth issues I have had with this phone are related to it turning off randomly, and it has only done it a handful at times since I got it 6 months ago. I can put the phone in a drawer, walk into another room at the other end of my house, and I get no audio dropouts. Works perfectly fine in the car too. The only time I've had annoying dropouts has been in crowded airport terminals where there are a ton of competing 2.4 Ghz signals interfering and I have the phone in my pocket on the opposite side of the receiving circuitry of my BlueBuds X. Even then, it's a quick blip and it returns. Bluetooth IS much worse with The Dash, but that thing has its own issues and it happens with any other Bluetooth device I use. Maybe the BlueBuds X just have great performance that make up for the Pixel's shortcomings. Jordan I have the regular Pixel 32GB on Verizon. I have had absolutely none of the issues you describe, though Bluetooth is weak, in that if myself or my dog are in the direct line of sight between the device the speakers/headphones, it will cut out. But I have had no issues with the bluetooth in my infotainment in my car (my S6 & S7 did make me reset it a few times, however). Other than the locked bootloader (-_-) it is the perfect device! whispy_snippet A friend asked me the other day whether he should get a Pixel. I said yes. Most "normal" people don't want to wait around for months to see what the next processor is, or whether the screen on the next generation of phones has a slightly better display to bezel ratio, or whether the fingerprint scanner is going to be on the front or back. They just want something that has all the apps they use and works well. The Galaxy S8 has more hardware bells and whistles than the Pixel, but if history is any indication, the Pixel is going to be much nicer to use over the life of both devices. And ultimately, user experience trumps everything if you ask me. Especially for the non-techie. King_Android And it's a good thing they don't read the AP site either. David is speaking to his audience i.e. us nerds, not normal every day consumers. disastrousrainbow Exactly this. Having worked at Verizon for many years, giving Joe Consumer the tech enthusiast viewpoint on why they shouldn't go with a phone that's a few months away from being replaced rarely worked. More so if they were replacing a damaged or lost phone. In a situation like that, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Pixel over any other phone right now point blank dot com. Even with the S8 out. Of course, this would only be the case if they said they wanted, say, the best camera around. Or wanted a reliable software experience, etc. Those keywords would instantly bring the Pixel to mind, and I wouldn't feel bad about sending them off with one because 9 out of 10 times when the next model comes out, they will really not care, especially if their phone is still working well. When it comes to your every day man, it's not the tech enthusiast you should be listening to when recommending something, but rather the needs of the person you're trying to help. Midnitte "When it debuted in October, the Google Pixel XL cost $770. The one you and I actually want, the 128GB model, cost $870. Six months later, the Pixel XL still costs $870. Is it worth it? Hah. No." Google is insane if they think a phone holds on to value that long. Considering all the high profile phones that have released after it, you'd think they would consider a price cut. MJ You have never taken an economics class huh? Supply and demand ring a bell at all? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why you can't buy one. No demand, no supply. MJ I think have seen you troll enough on AP now. BLOCKED Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! K77bkny Loooool people getting emotional over this bullshit device.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/649f431458908833d91263af6250ee8fbce01c1c6c9d7ca37827b1f65883a97e.gif Midnitte Six months sounds more like supply chain problems, not supply and demand. It's absolutely ridiculous that we're months away from the Pixel 2 and the Pixel 1 still costs $870 in the face of the Galaxy S8 and G6. Like the article, why would anyone recommend the Pixel 1 at $870 today? MJ It is a supply chain problem but that's irrelevant. The fact is the supply is not meeting the demand. Why would Google reduce the price on the phone? People are still buying it at that price regardless of what David, you, or I think about it. Cowboydroid After using a Pixel for several months, it is an insanely overpriced device. The only reason I own one is I got a great deal on it. Comparable performance and hardware can be had for less than half or even a third of the price. Sean People who write such things NEVER actually have a Pixel and are just haters. Those of us that actually have a Pixel (or XL) think they are superior to any phone we have ever owned........thanks for playing. Tr3ple You're so right about that. Cowboydroid Writing this from a Pixel XL right now, fanboy. Why get so emotional about a device? Debanjan Chowdhury I have been using alot of smartphones​. I used the OnePlus 3t, Nexus 6p, iPhone 7 plus, and even I have received the galaxy s8 plus yesterday. And I can surely say pixel xl will still be my daily driver. I am not a fanboy. I always support which works best for me. Yes, if Samsung had opted for a better camera, bigger battery and better fingerprint scanner position, I would have changed my daily driver to s8 plus. Good camera, snappy performance and stock Android are the priorities for me. And my pixel xl gives me all of these things. The Samsung galaxy s8 plus still has just little bit of hiccups here and there. But pixel xl, smooth 60fps all the time. And receiving updates at the earliest and it's unique update system works amazing for me. I would be really happy if it was water resistant. But I can't change my daily driver for only one benefit because pixel xl provides me dozens​ other benefits than my Samsung galaxy s8 plus or s7 edge and​ my iPhone 7 plus. Ismail Akram I had Oneplus 3 and I found Pixel XL to be more smooth and feels better than Oneplus. beside I love monthly security updates and loving that I can try android O( which I already did) and that Camera is really awesome. I think when Huawei can sell phones over $700 why not Google. (I would love if it was cheap but overall experience justifies that money for me) JD Man you need to raise your standards Sean Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore Winston David: Am I just a brainwashed Google fanboy (don't answer that question)? Yes. No. Probably. Maybe. Unlikely. Believable. Not sure. I'm a rebel. Andrew I know it's nitpicking but. I think you missed an 'us'. 'The Hardware' section, 2nd paragraph, last sentence. "...but I think it's safe to say most of want more screen where we can get it." Vivek Rameses Nobody is buying that piece of shit anyway. This is laughable. AndrewGM Good review, although if it's really the best smartphone you've ever used, then isn't it worth the premium price? Personally, I'm willing to pay another $100 or so for a phone I will use often, every day, for a couple of years and really enjoy using. The extra money in the end is nothing. I bought a used Pixel on eBay, so I saved about $50, but I really like it and am happy to pay a bit extra. The camera is great -- better than the iPhone, which I switched from. ddevito Remember when Android Police was an honest unbiased, tech savvy site? Alex Completely agree. Best phone I've ever owned, by far. Smooth as butter. Google just needs to work on their audio apis, along with other stuff. chumpatrump ive had a p6 huawei for 5 months and its feckin awesome. android like its meant to be - fast, stable, solid, easy to use, 36 hour charge TechGuy22 It's fine for what it is.

To whomever has a problem with the "don't buy this phone" line: if you're going to spend nearly $1000 on the Pixel, you're shortchanging yourself by not waiting less than half a year to spend the same amount on an upgraded device; you'd just be flat-out fiscally irresponsible. The 1st Gen Pixel will be a fine purchase after the Pixel 2 comes and the Pixel 1 goes on sale. At that point, it's fair game. You can save money and get a good experience, or you can pay more and get a great experience (relative). kaladdin I have had the Pixel XL since the launch. Yes, it is overpriced but the software experience alone makes it the best Android phone. P.S. I have never had any issues with the Bluetooth. Jago1908 Sorry, I just wasted some time here. I have my Moto X Play for one year now and it feels just as good as the time when I bought it. You're not selling it well. Give us a bit more. You're just leaving it personal. I prefer to use a cheaper phone that is as consistent as the Pixel. There are plenty. Come on! AhmedAlalfy Well why am I surprised ! A site as big as Android Police has to still suck it just not to piss off a company like Google. Well you could have deleted your (opinion article) better than making a fool of yourself like that. I know you said it's a good phone but these two articles in this order are just wrong. Be a man and stand for your words next time or just don't talk if you're afraid you're going to piss someone's off. I'm sound like hating I know but that's how I see it anyway take it or leave it. … I have a regular pixel.. it's awesome. Very consistent. Zero issues. No Bluetooth issues either, and the range is far superior to the Galaxy s7 we have to, so is the audio quality. Almost all his complaints I have never experienced, maybe it's a pixel xl thing? Idk.. and my battery life, is amazing compared to every other phone I have owned. I use a fair bit, and it lasts full day, usually still have 35-40% by 1am.. I stream music on and off all day, apps, surf, video.. usual stuff. No issues with slow finger print scanner either. It's bloody instant. I've owned Windows phones, and many "high end" android phones, and the pixel is the most reliable, most consistent phone I have had. I would buy again hands down. I'll take a product that just works right every time over bells and whistles. Yes make improvements, of course, but it really is the best overall phone I've ever used. Amit Raj I have been using the XL for about the same time...aside from the Warcraft struggle to get the phone, I agree with everything pointed out here. I do get these odd feelings to switch phones to the S8+ but I have no regrets with this phone. Having come from a flavoured android device (S6 Edge), I can vouch for the Pixel's fluidity, and consistency in performance. The only spite I have is the lack of android releases post 2018. Even Apple updates their devices that are nearly 5 years old. Why can't Google?! I can understand why any of the other ostensible android device manufacturers wouldn't rather can't update their devices to the latest android OS...hell they release devices like Rabbits reproducing. But for Google, come on you come out with 2 devices in a year and you can't give us atleast 4 years of android OS updates...leaving aside this rant, I really think you really get the real experience of having a smartphone...i.e. Android really puts the "smart" in smartphone and running it in its native state and on the Pixel it really outshines any other mobile OS to date...hands down....P.S. the Google keyboard could really get some AI updates for suggestions...other than this and the android OS upgrades, I'm a happy camper... Akshay Mehta Has anyone talked about the unlimited storage available in photos app ? I've shot photos and videos of more than 12GB since I got my pixel xl 6 months back. The camera and a consistent battery has just pushed me take so many photos! Even though I want to switch to s8, I can't. I'll just wait for pixel 2. Even though there have been numerous issues with the phone I still love it! Niero Gonzalez Buy it used. You can get a 32gb pixel for $400 on ebay, unlocked. Probably $300 when the new one is released. Unless you're an Android journalist there's no reason to buy an $800 phone unless you really want to show off your sushi photos Ryan Gray What's killing me is the screen burn in. Go watch a youtube video with a primarily solid color. Buttons and notifcation bar cant be unseen. Alisi Google any phone that has an AMOLED display about burn in. blindexecutioner I prefer the OnePlus 3T to the Pixel I sold. Never thought I would say that but I just don't care for the UI choices Google is making. Having the fingerprint scanner on the front along with capactivie buttons is really nice as well. Debanjan Chowdhury I also have a pixel xl and I love it. Debanjan Chowdhury Triggered Samsung fanboys, incoming. Debanjan Chowdhury I am using a pixel xl too but I never had Bluetooth problems​ like you​. OK Google detection never broke for me. I didn't have to replace it or anything like that. And I am happy to be in India because the low stock issue is not here. blueman24 No way I'm buying a 57k phone. Especially when its available in the US for more than 10k cheaper while still being overpriced. Peter Silie Why do you Keep talking about the 128GB version as the version "you and I actually want"? I wouldn't even know what to do with that much space on my phone. I'm on a 32GB N5X with a s**tload of apps installed and a lot of downloaded Play Music titles and I still got 10GB of space. So no, the version I actually want would be the 32GB non-XL Pixel ;-) Alisi Do you play games? Have daydream? I've already had to do the "you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here" dance several times with my 32Gb. Leroy Filon The stock availbabilty is insane. I live in the Netherlands and it's not even out here yet. I drove to Germany back in november to get it. People ask me a lot about my phone when they see my mobile pictures on instagram and i'll tell em it's the Google phone with pride. But it's a shame i can't share this epicnes with fellow owners here in the Netherlands. Michael Sørensen "I rarely really get annoyed using it." Really? "The Bluetooth connectivity sucks. The back of the phone has very obvious wear rub. The glass window scratches easily. It's not waterproof. 'OK Google' hotword detection breaks for no apparent reason, necessitating a reboot (...takes a minut-plus...). The fingerprint scanner is slow..." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LMAO... like I said, he didn't even list all of the flaws. If that's the best phone he's ever used, he set the bar incredibly low. I can't even imagine what worse phones he was comparing it to. Maxr1998 Well, G6, S8? They do some things better, but he says the Pixel is better at other things, so in the end it wins. 3223 I dunno about you guys, but from what I read almost all reviewers cannot grasp exactly why it is better than other phones, other than 'it just is'. They can say it is smoother, and faster and all that, but hard data doesn't seem to back up that claim and they rubbish synthetic benchmarks over some abstract claim. I'm starting to see that having a G at the back of the phone, just like an apple logo, may have a placebo effect on its own, bringing people some good vibes, just like nexii phones in the past. Which makes for an interesting read or research as to how brands can affect perception. Jan Ibrahim No. İt's nothing to do with placebo. There are very real significant improvements in touch latency which make a huge difference to your experience. İt's not a commonly spoken about feature or spec, which is why a lot of reviews might not know why the phone feels better. But that's the main thing. 3223 That's the thing. Touch latency is a very common issue on android. And tbh I've been using an HTC 10 which reviewers mentioned when it launched that they tried to reduce touch latency by quite a lot. Additionally if i remember correctly the htc m8 (which i also used before) was regarded as having low touch latency as well. So why is it that when other manufacturers do it, it's kinda swept under the rug but when the goog does it, it becomes the coming of the messiah? You're right though, that there should be more definite tests on touch latency, coz I'll only believe it when I see the numbers.. Theuntje How can you love the camera? Doesn't your main camera sucks in recording video? Looks even like that my front camera is better at capturing video.. Michael Sørensen Can someone please link to a video showing off this legendary fluidity compared to others? Why is it so difficult to actually show when it's apparently oh so obvious? David Newman I'd be interested to see how they compare to the MI Mix, my guess is not very well 🤔 roberto.elena Here is an idea for the next poll: Does David suffer dissociative identity disorder or is he just a troll? 1. Definitely DID 2. Definitely troll. 3. Even if you can, you shouldn't read everything he writes. 4. All he writes, including his personal Twitter, is gospel to me. Peter World Citizen This is the way I see it ... 1. David said don't buy the Pixel now 2. His Google tipster said he/she didn't like what he had said 3. David quickly back pedals with this article :) Kostas 💪🎩 you obviously didn't read it till the end Daishi Or at all... BeholdersEye I don't understand why there is no stereo speakers! Damnit Google, you're​ pushing the damn daydream view vr set then you don't put speakers on top and bottom (left/right in landscape mode), so BS! Google better offer trade-in for upgrade phone! And I certainly don't care for the extremely short software update deadend of only to 2018! We paid big bucks we deserve longer support!!!! Randy Gindy Everyone kind of dropped stereo speakers. Its really been replaced with a half assed version of stereo on some phones. Bottom firing and using the earpiece. username_not_valid I can only assume you havent used any other phone ever then. Nothing else makes logical sense. Jeff This is absolutely one of the worst phones I have ever used. It just had great marketing. For close to $1000 no Ir blaster to control remotes, people complaining about sound distortions, horrible and tedious screenshot capabilities and I don't think it charges fast at all. I'm going back to Samsung as soon as the note 8 is available. Cakefish October can't come soon enough! I need a Pixel 2 for the buttery performance, the amazing camera and the fast updates. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with the Galaxy S7, a great phone no doubt, but one that is showing signs of ageing (oleophobic coating wearing off, a battery that doesn't last as long as it used to and Android updates that come once in a blue moon). glebosotov Nice comment with funny mistype(is that how it's called?). BUTTERY more like battery Alisi Maybe he meant buttery as in smooth? glebosotov Maybe. Anyway, I think that most of us don't speak English as native language, so it's ok Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I don't know if other OEMs have this problem, but I suspect pre-S8, Samsung batteries have been notorious for aging quickly. Even my Note 4 battery died way before it should have. The only good thing is I didn't have to take it to a shop to get it replaced. Patrick Smithopolis The camera and the smooth and consistent performance is why I don't have the urge to get a new phone. someone755 Long-term? Fuck man, it hasn't even been a year. The fact that you need to point out how well it's held over less than half its already limited lifetime can mean only one of two things; Either you're trying to compensate for the fact that the phone isn't as good as you'd hoped it would be (which may or may not be related to its inflated price), or you indeed are a head-over-heels Google fan. For all the shit I defend you against, David, I expected better of you. alcor86 Why the hell don't people put phone cases & screen protectors on their phone? I do that right out the box. Peter Ebenezer I agree, I love the pixel. But every single person I've talked to about it, I've told to not buy it. Purely for the Bluetooth issues. My galaxy S2 I had before this had rock solid Bluetooth but was incredibly old so needed to modernise and was fed up of manufacturers that delay updates by adding bloatware.. The pros outweigh the cons. But the con is a big one... Not to mention the fact they are on about spitting out the next one already... chris My z5 just hit a reboot disaster I picked up a pixel xl 128gb for $950 aus, best phone I've ever used and no dramas with Bluetooth after first week, I was holding out for pixel 2 but didn't make it.. I'm happy with my buy anyway , it's a brilliant phone , buy off eBay not a store and save $300 that's my advice.. What supply issues lol GregAndo Thanks, I have pretty much had every Google phone phone since the Nexus One, and whilst also loved the form factor the Bluetooth issues, Battery issues and OS bugs pushing me to weekly reboots were more than I could handle. So I took the S8+ after the note 7 went back... and skipped the Pixel XL. So glad I did, I had the same issues and they infuriated me in the end. When Google finally gets the build of Android out that focuses out these bugs...I might go back. Tool then i am happy with the S8+ so far, I hope it is more reliable. Keg Man Waiting to hear from the note 7 owners. Most of us thought that was the perfect phone despite the one manufacturing defect Kakairo This matches my experience with the Pixel XL, with the exception of wear and tear (probably due to the slim Spigen case I put on it). With the Bluetooth, though, I wonder if it's an issue with Mazda Connect (I know you drive a Miata, David, I have a Mazda 3). I haven't had any issues with Bluetooth headphones, and I've had two rental Nissans in the past month that worked without issue for over a week. Would I buy it again? Yes, absolutely. Would I buy one right now? No, for the simple fact that the S8 has now surpassed it and that Pixel 2 can't be too far away. sam1331 Uh, the Pixel XL is a big phone. The Pixel is even a big phone, bigger than the iPhone 7 in every single dimension. They sell an iPhone SE that is significantly smaller and people buy it. My point is that, claiming no one should consider the Pixel because the Pixel XL isn't too big isn't an opinion, it's "lunacy". Rod iPhone 7 is 4.7" Andre Meaux Yep! Still love my Pixel (XL)!! Looking for the Pixel XL 2! destinyhud cant wait for the pixel 2. its going to be even more awesome. it will be a day one buy for me Rod There's one thing I wonder about the Pixel: in those PhoneBuff "speed tests" the Pixel is always put to shame when it doesn't hold more than 4 apps in background. However, in this one, it was able to hold 13 apps, being 4 of them, games. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ugcpul8nYg) Who's telling the truth, afterall? mattcoz I had issues with Bluetooth cutting out with my headphones, but then I turned off "phone audio" and it has been perfect. I have noticed that the signal will get weak if I sit on it, but uhh, yeah that makes sense, so I don't do that. Jordan L just this morning, for the first time ever my car would not connect to my Pixel. damn it. Rod David's curse Mike I must have a Pixel XL that is the diamond in the rough. I have a travel job, meaning I'm in rental cars several times a month. I have never once had bluetooth connectivity issues, for real. Henry S. Maybe it's just me but I don't understand this need to go YUuuuuGe with screens anymore. We've reached the point of usability and carrying the damn thing. 5" was the sweet spot for me as a phone. If I want media, I'll watch on my tablet. My perfect phone size was the old Droid MAXX(also a 5" phone). Most of the points make sense. I get the same battery life as you on my OG Pixel except Bluetooth. Only exception is switching between devices on my wife's small Bose speaker and we always have problems no matter the phone so it's not just the Pixel. Xenios Kofteros Got a full refund for my 1.5 year old Nexus 6P for the known battery issues. I'd very much like to buy a Pixel XL, but the price for new and used are ridiculous. Hopefully Google will break tradition and reveal Pixel 2 at Google I/O. Or else I'm going the OnePlus 5 way and break 4 years of Google phone use tradition. ClikFire _ I haven't had any of the issues you mentioned except the issue with hairline scratches because I hate using cases. SoI covered the glass windows with a Matte Black Dbrand Skin and found a Tempered Glass screen bezel which actually transformed the Dark Grey Bezels to true black bezels and covered up the scratches in the process. Also coming from an S7 edge I actually really like the Design of the Pixel personally especially the back with the Glass window, makes it stand out from the rest. If the Pixel 2 looks like this and adds front facing speakers and water resistance I'm game. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/842173829c88496d628fe9ecdf0b77f65995d3ca89cb1a2d93e7896ad2c760f1.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Google continues the current trend in its phones, it's more likely to look like this. ;) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6945f5a7bc54ba27628971ea239b5d6ee5d8f0bb2b8aa844f6e67a2d6ec05c12.png Rod I was about to burst in laughter, then I thought this may actually happen. Ozl Never had any problems with my 128GB Pixel, still works great! krkn I got the Pixel 128GB when it came out because I had a Note7, which I loved, and the XL was unavailable. Despite the smaller size, I have still really enjoyed the phone. Like you said, it remains snappy and the better life good, and sometimes I actually appreciate something that fits in my pocket so nicely. Photos are terrific. My main gripe is the speaker location, which is blocked easily in landscape mode, but that's a small nit since if I really need better sound, I'll be plugged in or using a Bluetooth speaker. Randall Collins I have the XL and I haven't had quite as many issues with mine but it really is a great phone despite all that. No lag, smooth, and the first to get updates with no crazy UI to destroy the experience. And I updated from an iPhone 6+ which had all those same attributes. No phone will ever be perfect but for now, the XL works for me. likurges if the phone was so great as it's bezzels it would be the best phone ever Randy Gindy At least I have something to hold onto when I watch a video. likurges yes because a phone is a heavy thing and doesn't have corners. thank god for the bezels of the pixel. also think for example if you hear some shocking news, you can hold to those bezels and they might as well save your life JR I'd have no problem recommending either of the Pixel devices to potential buyers, today. Many buyers enter the market for a new phone, because they need one. If you're one of those people who only updates their device when the current one is on its last leg, then the Pixel is an outstanding option (six months isn't something many would care to wait). The casual buyer primarily needs a good experience, preferably over a long term, and as discussed in this article, the Pixel delivers this quite well, 'right now' (to be fair, that's *if* you can find one). If the price drops once the Pixel 2 launches, even better. If you're talking to enthusiasts, then we can push this a few ways, but we always have the option to sell the Pixel, should we desire the new shiny thing. The Nexus 6P (still a great phone) fetches nice prices in the aftermarket, and the Pixel is generally understood to be an even better phone. I'm sure the Pixel will command a fine (but lower than new) aftermarket price, and there will always be a set of buyers who can't afford the absolute latest, but will be willing to scoop one up at a more realistic discount. So unless the device is missing game-breaking, hard features you rely on (waterproofing, because you're a part-time lifeguard), then I think it would be acceptable to recommend it. Fastguy77 This article makes no sense. I purchased a pixel brand new for half price, best decision ever. Phone is amazing. So by all means, find someone selling it below MSRP and grab it. Waiting half a year because 'you'll regret' not having the newest is typical tech buyer stupidity. So, just wait and never buy a product, cause around the corner is the next better version... xyz "Is the XL worth $770 to pick up today?" Wasn't worth it even at release!

(2017) Google Now and Google Play Store run into problems thanks to Google’s server-side testing To test how changes to the Android UI would go over, or how new features added to the platform would be received by users, Google randomly uses server-side tests to get the lay of the land. The only problem is that these tests can sometimes lead to some unexpected results. Currently, there are two tests being done that ended up breaking Google Now and the Google Play Store. The test to the Google Play Store removes everything from the home page. Yes, you can still search for apps, install them, and manually update them too. But the Play Store’s home page is blank, and there is no workaround for this issue. You will have to wait for a fix from Google. The problem affecting Google Now results in an error message appearing on the screen instead of your informative cards.  However, there is a workaround here. Go to Settings > More > Application Manager > Google App > Manage Storage > Clear Google Search Data. Open up Google Now again, and your cards should be there.

As far as developers are concerned, the Android O Developer Preview started officially on March 21st; it will end some time in this year’s third quarter when phone manufacturers are expected to receive the final version of the operating system. Developers who are members of the preview program are currently in “Preview 1,” which means that they have access to the alpha version of Oreo (assuming that is what the build will be called). Developer Preview 1 is intended for developers, not consumers, and can only be flashed to a supported device. The first beta version of Android O will be available during Google I/O. When the time comes, those interested in joining the Android O beta program will be able to sign up to receive these versions of Android O via an OTA update. Just keep in mind that since these will be beta releases, there are bound to be some issues that need to get ironed out. Keep checking in and we will let you know when the new registration page is up. Supported devices will include: Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Pixel C image Android Nougat beta program is over image Timeline indicates that the first Android O beta release will take placeduring Google I/O source: AndroidBetaProgram, AndroidDevelopers via AndroidAuthority Posted on May 7, 2017Author wiredgorilla Post navigation Previous Previous post: Best board games for Android and iPhone!

Not long after the app was updated with new wallpapers (plus UI enhancements and bug fixes), it’s been discovered that it now contains two completely new wallpaper categories: Art, and Solid Colors. Art mostly includes cool patterns and digital art, while Solid Colors is – yep, you’ve guessed it – the place to go if you just need simple, solid color wallpapers.

Gadgets Is Google Home cool or not? By Ole - May 7, 2017 8 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you are interested in gadget and technology in general, you have heard about Google Home. We have tested Google Home for about 3 months now, so is Google Home cool or not? When we first got Google Home in our office, we were really hyped about it. So we did not only buy one, we bought 3 Google Home. We did not really know what to expect or even know what we were going to use it for. The installation of the 3 Google Homes was really easy, almost too easy. In our office we also have Lifx bulbs, so that was the first thing we connected to the Google Home. We also use Spotify quite a bit in our office, so that was the second thing we connected. That is almost where the story ends because that is basically what we have used the Google Homes for, lights and music. Of course, we have tried to talk with Google up to several times to have fun – but we are not really using it very actively for other things. The reason is quite simple – it is too complicated to have Google Home search for things on Google – it`s much more easy to just go on your phone. Our conclusion is that Google Home is defiantly a cool piece of technology to try and even take part in. The possibilities for Google Home in the future is quite big, but for now Google Home is cool but not very practical.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Scofabear Is anyone having issues with Google now weather cards showing the wrong location? Amit_N Seriously.. on weekend? Why are Googlers working on weekends? Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess.

Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

Quotes in the article New York Times Co NYT ▲ 16.95 +0.20 +1.19% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 148.96 +2.43 +1.66% In January, Uber lost more than 200,000 customers in a single weekend after the #DeleteUber movement led to a fury of account deletions by customers upset about its ties to President Trump. But that was just a prelude to Uber's no-good, very bad month. During the roughly 30-day period of mid-February to mid-March, the company was pummeled by a seemingly never-ending barrage of bad news, with a new crisis almost every day. And it's barely slowed down since then. Here's everything that's happened to Uber since things took a turn for the worse in February: Sunday February 19: The beginning© Provided by Business Insider Susan Fowler starts it all with her reflections on "one very, very strange year at Uber." Fowler, a former engineer at the company, alleged in a blog post that she was sexually harassed at Uber and experienced gender bias during her time at the company. She claimed that one manager propositioned her and asked for sex, but her complaints to HR were dismissed because the manager was a high performer. She said Uber continued to ignore her complaints to HR, and then her manager threatened to fire her for reporting things to HR. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick immediately pledges to look into Fowler's investigations, and hires former US Attorney General Eric Holder to lead the investigation. Kalanick responded within hours of publication to say Fowler's account was "abhorrent & against everything we believe in." Uber hires Eric Holder, former US attorney general, to lead an independent investigation into it. Wednesday February 22: Cocaine and groping© Provided by Business Insider The New York Times publishes a bombshell report that suggests Fowler's claims were not isolated. Employees did cocaine during a company retreat and a manager had to be fired after groping multiple women, according to the report. Former employees said they'd notified Uber's leadership, including Kalanick and CTO Thuan Pham, of the workplace harassment. Thursday February 23: Investor betrayal and accusations of stolen technology© Provided by Business Insider Uber investors, Freada and Mitch Kapor, blasted the company for failing to change. In an open letter to Uber's investors and board, the Kapors said Uber has ignored the behind-the-scenes work that some of its investors have tried to do for years to change the company culture. "We are speaking up now because we are disappointed and frustrated; we feel we have hit a dead end in trying to influence the company quietly from the inside," the Kapors wrote. Google, another Uber investor, sued the company for intellectual property theft. In an explosive lawsuit, the Google self-driving-car group, now known as Waymo, accused Uber of using stolen technology to advance its own autonomous-car development. The suit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, claimed that a team of ex-Google engineers stole the company's design for the lidar laser sensor that allows self-driving cars to map the environment around them. Friday February 24: Losing the benefit of the doubt© Provided by Business Insider Uber denied Google's claims of stealing its self-driving tech. "We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court," a spokesperson said.  On the same, Uber also had to clarify that it's not behind mysterious efforts to dig up 'intimate' info about the ex engineer who accused it of sex harassment. Fowler tweeted that someone was doing research for a "smear campaign" against her, warning her friends to beware of anyone seeking personal information about her. Uber said it was not involved in any such efforts. But trust in the company was undermined that same day when a news report revealed that Uber's account of another controversial incident was not entirely forthright. Uber had blamed "human error" for one its self-driving car running a red light on a San Francisco street in December. As The New York Times revealed, it was the self-driving car system that failed to recognize the six stop lights at the intersection and run the red as a passenger entered the crosswalk. The only "human error" was that the human failed to notice the car's error and correct it in time. One week into the storm, crisis experts agree: Uber needs to make a big statement, and that might mean firing Kalanick "If I were on the board, I would find a way to get rid of him," said Michael Barnett, a business and management professor at Rutgers University. Read more: "Travis Kalanick is Uber's biggest asset, and now its biggest liability" But Uber had an even worse week to come. Monday February 27: A high-profile exec is out under a cloud of controversy© Provided by Business Insider Uber's SVP of engineering stepped down over sexual-harassment allegations at his former job at Google. The engineer, Amit Singhal, left Uber after Recode's Kara Swisher notified the company of the allegations through her reporting. When Uber CEO Travis Kalanick found out, he asked Singhal to resign, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person also said that Singhal went through the standard background checks before his employment at Uber and that the sexual-harassment allegations during Singhal's time at Google never came up. Singhal has strenuously denied the allegations. Tuesday February 28: Kalanick loses his cool© Provided by Business Insider A dashcam video caught Uber CEO in a heated argument over prices. A video published by Bloomberg showed Kalanick losing his cool in an argument with an Uber driver on Super Bowl Sunday after the driver confronted him about lowered fares. Kalanick then issued a "profound" apology and says he'll seek leadership help. "My job as your leader is to lead…and that starts with behaving in a way that makes us all proud," he wrote in the apology. "That is not what I did, and it cannot be explained away. This is the first time I've been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it." Wednesday March 1: Arch-rival Lyft seizes the moment© Provided by Business Insider Lyft, capitalizing on the moment, is trying to raise $500 million to fight Uber. In a kick 'em when they're down way (or just smart business), The Wall Street Journal reported that Uber rival Lyft is trying to raise an extra half a billion to fund its growth against a cash-flush Uber. Thursday March 2: Uber has hired another law firm © Provided by Business Insider    Ex-Uber engineer Susan Fowler said the company is blaming her for users deleting their account and investigating her personal life. As a result, she's hired her own lawyer. Uber acknowledges that it hired a second law firm, Perkins Coie, to look into her allegations (but, the company says, not investigate her personally). Uber changed its mind about its self-driving cars. After a clash with California's DMV in December, Uber did an about-face and decided to apply for a permit for its self-driving cars to get them back in California. Its spat with California regulators in December was the beginning of the old Uber starting to rear its ugly head, but the company's change of mind was a sliver of a good press in the maelstrom of scandals. Friday March 3: 'Greyballs' and another executive resignation© Provided by Business Insider The New York Times revealed that Uber has been secretively deceiving authorities for years with a tool called 'Greyball'.  Uber used the tool to evade authorities, particularly at times when city regulators were trying to block the ride-hailing service, according to a report by The New York Times' Mike Isaac. The tool collected data from Uber's app to identify and evade officials in cities like Boston, Paris, and Las Vegas. The Times reports that the program was used in markets where Uber was banned or being resisted by law enforcement. Uber loses another top VP: Uber's VP of Product and Growth, Ed Baker, suddenly resigned after more than three years at the company. In an email obtained by Recode, Baker said he wanted to join the public sector, but his departure has mysterious timing as Recode alleged there was other "questionable" behavior from the executive. Meanwhile, the Uber exec and board member who oversaw the HR department has been strangely absent during Uber's biggest crisis. Business Insider reports that Ryan Graves' absence is leading some inside and outside the company to wonder whether he could take the fall — with or without cause. Graves also has ties to "Greyball" since he was aware of the program. March 7: Uber is officially looking for a COO© Provided by Business Insider Uber CEO Kalanick agrees to get help for the next chapter of Uber. After admitting he needs leadership help following the leaked video him arguing with a driver, Kalanick made it official that he was looking for a COO for the company — "a peer who can partner with me to write the next chapter in our journey." Many people want a Sheryl Sandberg-like fixture to balance Kalanick, if not just Sandberg herself.  March 8: Uber changes it mind about greyballing as the executive exodus continues© Provided by Business Insider Uber back-tracked and changed its position on "Greyballing." While it first gleefully admitted that it had used the controversial to target government officials, Uber reversed its position and said it would no longer do so going forward. The executive exodus also continued with Uber's head of AI only lasting four months at the company. Gary Marcus stepped aside to become an "adviser" to Uber, only four months after the ride-hailing company had acquired his artificial intelligence startup, Geometric Intelligence. March 17: Leaked data shows Uber's self-driving cars can't drive themselves© Provided by Business Insider To make matters worse, data leaked showed that Uber's self-driving car project is a long way from becoming a reality. One particularly alarming statistic was that in the week that ended March 8, the cars travelled only 0.8 miles on average between each time a human driver had to take control, overriding the self-driving tech, otherwise known as a disengagement. By comparison, Google's self-driving cars are streets ahead. Waymo cars last year were being disengaged at a rate of just once per 5,000 miles, according to data released in February. March 19: Uber's president quits© Provided by Business Insider Uber suffered another black-eye when its president abruptly quit the company after only six months.  In a statement, Jeff Jones said he was leaving because "the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided [his] career are inconsistent with what [he] saw and experienced at Uber." There was no love lost between the company and Jones. "After we announced our intention to hire a COO, Jeff came to the tough decision that he doesn’t see his future at Uber. It is unfortunate that this was announced through the press but I thought it was important to send all of you an email before providing comment publicly," Kalanick wrote to his employees. Shortly after Jones' departure, it was reported that another VP was also leaving. Brian McClendon, who lead Uber's mapping teams, had planned to leave the company, but the timing was of course poor given the other departures. McClendon said he was heading back to Kansas where he wants to get into politics. March 21: Uber says it's turning things around© Provided by Business Insider Given its bad month, Uber is at the point where it's starting to make some changes. In its first press conference since the series of crises started piling up, Uber said it's already taking steps to reverse its course, including: Releasing a diversity report Opening an anonymous tip line for employees to air complaints Holding more than 120 "listening sessions" with employees Updating 1,500 job descriptions to eliminate any "unconscious bias" Travis Kalanick was missing from the call because he was busy interviewing COO candidates. But the company's board indicated that it supported Kalanick's continued role in the CEO job. Uber said it's not going to work on filling the various recently-vacated executive positions until it's hired a new COO who can be part of the process.  March 25: Travis Kalanick's visit to a Seoul escort-karaoke bar is revealed© Provided by Business Insider A bombshell report by The Information describes a 2014 Uber team visit to a escort-karaoke bar in Seoul. According to the report, "four male Uber managers picked women out of the group, calling out their numbers, and sat with them." After the evening, a female Uber employee told HR that the trip made her uncomfortable.  March 25: Uber suspends self-driving car program in Arizona after an autonomous vehicle was involved in a crash in Tempe, Arizona© Provided by Business Insider An Uber SUV operating in autonomous mode was involved in an accident. Although nobody was seriously injured and a police spokesperson reportedly said that Uber was not at fault, Uber told Business Insider it was halting its self-driving car pilot in Arizona.  April 2: The New York Times accuses Uber of psychologically manipulating its drivers© Provided by Business Insider A report from the New York Times details the psychological tricks Uber employs to keep drivers on the road. Calling it one of the greatest behavioral experiments, the Times detailed how Uber uses everything from push notifications to incentives to shortening the time between pick-ups to keep drivers going on the road.  April 11: Uber's top PR chief joins executive exodus© Provided by Business Insider Rachel Whetstone, Uber's head of communications and policy, left the company after months of crises. Whetstone, who joined Uber in 2015 after a long stint overseeing communications at Google, had struggled to get Uber back on message. Jill Hazelbaker, who used to report to her, took on the new role. April 21: The investigation into Uber's workplace is extended© Provided by Business Insider Uber delays the investigation into workplace harrasment after information pours in from "hundreds" of its employees. Instead of coming at the end of April, the report from former Attorney General Eric Holder needed more time to interview execs and leave "no stone unturned." It's now expected at the end of May.   April 23: It wasn't just "Greyball." Uber tried to deceive Apple, too© Provided by Business Insider Tim Cook once called Travis Kalanick into his office and told him to knock it off. A New York Times story published on April 23 revealed that the Apple CEO had threatened to yank Uber from the App Store if it continued to violate the App Store's terms and conditions. As an act of fraud prevention, Uber had affixed a small piece of code that could tell if someone was using the same phone over and over again and then wiping it to take advantage of promo codes.  May 1: Travis Kalanick cancels appearance at Code Conference© Provided by Business Insider Travis Kalanick canceled a headliner interview he promised before the wave of scandals hit and rattled some people's confidence in the CEO. Kalanick bowed out of Recode's Code Conference nearly a month before he was set to take the stage. Renowned tech journalist Kara Swisher gave the CEO a written lashing for not addressing his company's problems and backing down from the interview during a time of trouble. Axios' Dan Primack also questioned whether Kalanick was right to continue the job if he couldn't handle a sit-down with the press. May 3: Waymo accuses Uber of creating a shell company to bring on a former Google engineer.© Provided by Business Insider Google accused rival Uber of plotting a devious "cover-up scheme" with a former Google engineer to steal crucial self-driving car technology. Uber acquired Otto in August, but according to Google's lawyers, Otto was never meant to operate as a real business. In a court hearing on a preliminary injunction, Google's attorneys sought to portray Otto, the startup company founded by the former engineer, as a shell company designed to help Uber catch up in the highly competitive self-driving-car field. Waymo (Google's self-driving car project) is trying to block Uber from developing its self-driving technology and infringing on trade secrets.  May 4: The U.S. Justice department opens a criminal investigation into Uber's use of 'Greyball'© Provided by Business Insider The U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal probe into  'Greyball'. Reuters first reported that U.S. authorities were looking into the Greyball tool, which helped Uber drivers evade transportation regulators who were looking to crack down on the ride-hailing service. Uber acknowledged it used the tool, including against officials in cities like Portland, Oregon. It hasn't been all bad, though. Uber's diversity report was better than expected.© Provided by Business Insider March 28: Uber's diversity numbers are not great, but not the worst when compared to industry giants like Facebook, Apple, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft. As part of its pledge to turnaround the company, Uber released its first diversity report after Kalanick had pushed back on it for years. However, the investigation into the company's work culture changed the CEO's mind. One glaring problem is the lack of women and underrepresented minorities in tech leadership positions. Nearly 89% of technical directors are male at Uber, and 75% are white. And now Uber is looking to the skies with flying cars.© Provided by Business Insider April 25: Uber announced that it wants to test its network of flying cars by 2020. "It’s push a button and get a flight," said Jeff Holden, Uber's Chief Product Officer, in his keynote at the Uber Elevate Summit. By 2020, the company wants to have its first public demonstration of a network of electric planes that could ferry passengers at 150 m.p.h. through urban skies to their destinations. Uber wants to debut the Uber Elevate network when Dubai hosts the World's Fair in 2020.  Flying cars may be a distraction from its business woes, but that's the distraction the company may need.

A young IT worker poses for a photo in Yangon on March 20, 2013 in anticipation of Eric Schmidt’s visit. Photo: AFP Speaking to an audience comprising mostly students at Myanmar Information and Communication Technology (MICT) Park, Mr Schmidt said that “young people and technology equals prosperity”. “You have the young people, technology is coming.” Google plans to roll out improved applications for local searches and mapping, and a new translation application, Mr Schmidt said. The easing of international sanctions is expected to soon allow for the operation of the Google Play Store and Google Wallet within the country on Android phones. Also, the company will launch google.com.mm – a search engine portal with native Myanmar-language support – in the next few weeks, he added. But Google will just lay the technical underpinnings for telecommunications development; technical innovation will come from Myanmar’s youth, Mr Schmidt said. “Students will take care of everything else. They’ll build the content and they’ll build the apps,” he said. Mr Schmidt said that further success is contingent on building up the technical literacy of children. “We need to get educational material ready for smart phones and tablets,” he said. “You have to start young and get the curiousity of the children.” Now, only 1 percent of Myanmar’s population accesses the internet. It is largely utilised in English and by the elite and some students, Mr Schmidt said. Only about 9pc have mobile phone access, and most users are concentrated in urban Yangon. But Google maintains that if the government does not attempt to regulate the telecommunications sector, and allow private competition, it will boom – perhaps meeting President U Thein Sein’s goal of reaching an 80pc country-wide mobile penetration by 2015. “I believe something extraordinary in Myanmar is going to happen now. I’m convinced you’re all in for the ride of your life right now,” Mr Schmidt said. Mr Schmidt left Yangon to meet with President U Thein Sien in Nay Pyi Taw. He arrived in Yangon from a visit to India, where he warned the country on March 21 of not keeping up with new technology and innovation after such a long period of success in the IT sector. Founded in 2001, MICT Park accommodates 50 locally-based IT companies. The event was hosted by the Myanmar Computer Federation.

A last minute issue forced a delay for several smartwatches that were on track to be among the first to receive Android Wear 2.0. Huawei confirmed last month that Google had fixed the issue and that the update would be out soon. The Huawei Watch Android Wear 2.0 update is now finally being released. Huawei said early last month that Google had addressed the issue that had caused the delay in the first place. It promised that the update would roll out for its first smartwatch in the near future. It still took Huawei a month to follow through on its promise of releasing said update for the Huawei Watch soon. Nevertheless, owners of the company’s first smartwatch will be happy to find out that the update is now rolling out. Huawei Watch owners have now taken to Reddit to confirm that they are finally receiving the Android Wear 2.0 update on their smartwatches. However, it seems that the update isn’t being pushed to the smartwatch automatically. Users have been pulling it manually by tapping on the “system is up to date” screen in the settings menu. Just make sure that the Huawei Watch is connected to Wi-Fi otherwise it won’t manually download the update. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about android updates, Android Wear 2.0 and huawei watch.

The Oracle of Omaha, who according to Forbes is worth an estimated $74billion, says he blew it by not buying up shares of Google and Amazon when their stock price was a fraction of what it is today. Buffett told shareholders of his company Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday that he realized early on that Google was turning significant profits from advertising on the Internet though he did not think it could sustain long-term success, CNBC reported. He told Berkshire shareholders on Saturday that Geico, a Berkshire subsidiary, was paying Google $10 per click whenever someone clicked on its ads.

Published on May 7, 2017. 0 Remember when Google Maps was just a small and simple location app? Well, you might be aware of the fact that the app grew tremendously in the past years, and has offered quite a few unique innovations as far as its market segment is concerned. As far as Maps’ most remarkable upgrades, we’ve loved these the most: Local reviews in all native languages; Parking difficulty icons; Wheelchair-friendly pointers; Full Uber integration; And real-time traffic info. Google Maps has evolved far from being a mere collection of maps from across the globe. The app is now a reliable navigation tool that everyone can use. And now, the developer team in charge of making Maps better has set out on a new and bold endeavor. Extracting Information from Google’s Street View The brave new project is titles ‘Attention-Based Extraction of Structured Information from Street View Imagery’ and it basically aims to take street names, as well as numbers and local businesses directly from picture off of Street View. This means that Maps will be kept up to date at all times. However, the algorithm behind it is understandably very complex, so Google are taking their time to optimize it. The project is based on deep neural networks, which allow for a proper automation of the extraction function. The Deep Learning system will analyze data gathered by Google’s beloved Street View cars, and will identify in them particularities such as numbers and street names. Thus, mapping out a town or city becomes easier than ever. And the algorithm is also very efficient and reliable, so there is no room for mistakes. We’ll have to wait and see how the whole thing works, because as we mentioned before, Google is working hard to optimize it to the last details.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Bill Perrotta What in the world are you are talking about? Supposedly this happened a day ago and I didn't even notice it. Everything is normal right now. Scofabear Is anyone having issues with Google now weather cards showing the wrong location? Amit_N Seriously.. on weekend? Why are Googlers working on weekends? Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares197 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. LondonLeedsFan Absolutely. Release a product, sell it at full price, and provide us with a limited, half-baked and delayed service. Thanks Google! xyz First of all, you should know that no one gives a shit about your feelings. Anyway, nothing funnier than people who are ignorant about everything outside their borders lecturing people on their country's law and regulations. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? LondonLeedsFan Mate, if you want Downton Abbey, you're more than welcome to it! ;) Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english? Lars Jeppesen Yes, language is US English, also on my phone LondonLeedsFan We don't even have podcasts on Play Music yet in the UK. Tiuri Elvander For some reason I just got them this weekend. Go to the Play Music website and log out and log in again. Maybe if you have a secondary google account, try that and then return to your main account. I logged in using my dad's account and then when I logged in using my own account again, I got the new look (mid 2016 look) Play Music, including podcasts!

Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! Jack Smith Wow! Thanks. Never realized you could do this. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd. Paul Quinn I debated on that. I think I prefer the ominous nature of it. Reminds me of THE Borg. xyz It's appropriate because now Google can listen to everything you say at home. Nick Riviera It works terribly, like quite a few new services. Amit Interesting. No such issues for me. I haven't found home to falter even once, from what I asked for... el conejo Don't worry I'll place a logic bomb called "America Only" and that sh*t will blow up your network trafficking toolkit Paul Quinn We've updated the article because some of you are able to get this to work outside the US. Thanks for that info! Zsolt V How about checking first before spreading FUD? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. CD RW can't wait to have my nightly ASMR from Google Badouken I've been using this when reading, it makes for a relaxing read. surethom Does not work here in the UK. Unless u have to pay for subscription which I don't. Blake Sinnett They need to add this. https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA Paul Quinn Totally! Tell your Home.... Say, "Hey Google, I want to give feedback." Jack Smith Are you not the author? Are you not suppose to know the device? The poster can do this on the GH no problem and should that not be the answer? Jack Smith You can use it and I do similar with others. Just ask your GH to play it. Most nights we listen say at bedtime "hey google play 10 hours of thunderstorms" and it plays it from YouTube. But thanks for sharing because this is what I will use this evening for sure. Hope the wife does not mind. Jack Smith Love the ambient sounds built-in. But my preference right now is the 10 hours of thunderstorms with flutes from YouTube. Highly recommend. The problem with the others is they do not last long enough. Jack Smith Well re-reading article I am a dork. Never thought to ask for a time period with the built-in white noise. Jack Smith This is not a US only thing you just can play ambient or white noise from YouTube and we do it all the time. Tons more selection and some really good ones. But I really wish the author would know the GH better and share such things. Everytime he writes on the GH drives me nuts as pretty much every time there is incorrect information or something misleading or key points missing and has to be cleaned up in the comments area. Why? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. The difference here (and the point of the article) was that the GH has this feature built in and includes the ability to set a timer with it. The GH has always been able to play audio tracks of any kind. I guess I could have mentioned this alternate means of playing ambient sound in a sentence. Thanks for the feedback! I am new to this so it all just fine tunes my writing! Cory S If you tell it to play it to a chromecast, they appear to just be existing youtube videos.

 The inventor of the web Tim Berners-Lee on the future of the internet, 'fake news,' and why net neutrality is so important Mathias Döpfner, Die Welt May 7, 2017, 12:18 PM 3,425 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, being interviewed by Axel Springer CEO Mathias Dophfner Die Welt Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner sat down with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, for a far-ranging conversation on the future of the internet, fake news, net neutrality, and the rising tide of censorship in countries across the world. A few of Berners-Lee's highlights: How Google's ad system led to the proliferation of "fake news" during the 2016 election. Why monopolies in tech are not as dangerous as they appear. Why net neutrality was critical to the formation of the internet and why it's still important today. Here's the Q&A: Mathias Döpfner:  In a way, you are the Konrad Zuse for the digital world. In 1989, you created the World Wide Web, which is basically seen as the ideal for transparency. Do you sometimes feel that this ideal is transforming into a monster? Tim Berners-Lee:  Over the decades, I changed my answer to that. For the first two decades, I would answer as a matter of principle that, when you look out there, you see humanity. Humanity has good sides and bad sides. The Web has to be an accurate mirror of humanity. Therefore, you will find bad stuff, and you will find good stuff, horrible stuff and glorious stuff. That was my answer for a long time. Now we’ve gotten into the age of social networks, I think the last couple of years have made a lot of people rethink. So having spent two decades trying to keep the Web open, keep it neutral, assuming that, if humanity has an open and neutral Web, then it will build wonderful things with it, like Wikipedia, etc. Now we’ve realized, actually, it might not. It depends what sort of system technically you build on the Web when you build something like a social networking system. Now, depending on how you design it, it can be lent to a more constructive argument or a less constructive argument. It can be lent to a propagation of wonderful sort or the propagation of hatred. Döpfner:  If you were to draw a line through the World Wide Web and digitalization today, would it be more good or more bad? Berners-Lee:  Net, more good. Döpfner:  Let’s go back to the ’80s when you worked in Geneva and, step by step, you came up with this groundbreaking innovation. How did it happen?  Berners-Lee:  Now you’re a journalist, and I’m an inventor, and journalists always ask inventors about the way we came up with it. Döpfner:  Some of the biggest inventions happen when scientists are looking for something completely different. Berners-Lee:  Yeah, some of those are very interesting. Döpfner:  Viagra was invented against high blood pressure. Berners-Lee:  Exactly. In this case, no. I had been working on problems like that for years and years and years, and I had worked on text formatting programs, and I had worked on data transition programs, and I’d worked on operating systems, and I’d worked on user interfaces. Everywhere I’d gone, I found myself frustrated by the fact that anything they gave you which was printed for a meeting, there’d always be a disc copy somewhere. So somewhere, there would be a copy of this thing going round and round on a computer, and that computer was probably connected indirectly or directly to the Internet, but once I had the piece of paper, I couldn’t actually search electronically without jumping through completely different hoops for each system. So the lack of interoperability between all the systems for handling information was frustrating. CERN was a great place. It was full of wonderful people, full of wonderful different ideas, and it was very diverse. So in a way, it had that problem of diversity and to perhaps a greater extent than most places. I wanted to solve the problem of lack of interoperability. I’d seen a lot of people who had actually tried to do that by building one single system, and whenever they’d done the centralized approach, they’d failed because they would decide to use the IBM mainframe. So I realized that the ideal would be actually to leave people using their existing systems. Döpfner:  Could you describe a little bit how long it took to really develop it and how many people had you involved? Was it a big team, or was it basically done in splendid isolation? Berners-Lee:  Well, what took a long time was getting the space to be able to work on it because CERN didn’t make general-purpose software. So I didn’t get any official go-ahead at all. Well, my boss Mike Sendall, in fact, he had a twinkle in his eye, and he found an excuse for me to do it. I’d given him a memo describing it, and I’d also said that I was really interested in getting a NeXT machine. The NeXT was a box. It was the thing that Steve Jobs did when he left Apple. So that was in itself a really interesting creative thing, and he developed that for people to be able to communicate. So Mike said, "Okay. You’re interested in the NeXT. Let’s just get one. We need to develop something just to test the NeXT box.“ So with a big wink, he says, "Why don’t you just try it out, that hypertext thing you were talking about or something like that?" So the NeXT arrived in 1990 in September. I started working in October. I had the Web working in the end of November, in fact after a couple of months really developing it. Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web. Die Welt Döpfner:  Sorry, from October to November, that would be just two months? Berners-Lee:  Yep. Döpfner:  That was it? Berners-Lee:  That was it, it was a really good development platform. Döpfner:  How high was the budget? Berners-Lee:  Zero. It was all unofficial, zero budget, but Mike allowed my 20 percent time to expand to 100 percent time. Döpfner:  That was crucial? Tim Berners-Lee:  That was crucial. I didn’t get back that memo that I gave him until after he died. His wife Peggy found it, and she found that he’s written on the top corner in a pencil, "Vague, but exciting." Döpfner:  That’s wonderful. Berners-Lee:  It was an exponential progress. Over the first year, it grew. The number of hits on our server, my personal server, went up by a factor of 10. The next year, they went up by 10. The following year, they went up by 10. So it was linear if you kept it on a scale of powers of 10. It was exciting, of course, because something that grows that fast was unusual at that point. One crisis was a challenge with the Gopher project. The University of Minnesota had a project which was a campus-wide information system quite like the Web. It worked on the Internet. It didn’t have exactly links, but it was competing, and in fact, it was more popular than the World Wide Web. At the time, the World Wide Web was increasing exponentially, and the Gopher project  was increasing exponentially, and it was winning. Then there was a point when the University of Minnesota said, "Maybe it won’t be royalty free. Maybe we won’t charge. Only the service, we won’t charge academics, only businesses, but if you’re a business, not now, but later, and a very small amount, but we might possibly reserve the right to charge for the system in the future." That was it. That was the end of Gopher on the Internet. So that was a big lesson. That was an opportunity in that the people wanted to know. They demanded a statement from CERN. So eventually, it was after 18 months of the project start, and on April 30th, 1993, CERN made that commitment to a royalty free license. Ten years later, all the members of the Web Consortium, all the industry members, also made a similar commitment to keep it patent free. So that was, in a way, the crisis of the early Web. If anybody’d ended up charging royalties for it, that would’ve just settled it. Döpfner:  Of course, you as an inventor had to be passionate about it. How about the other people in the institute or the people that were working with you? Did they understand the vision, or was there also a lot of opposition or criticism? Berners-Lee:  There was a lot of opposition because a lot of people did not understand what it would be like, and it’s really difficult to explain to millennials now why they couldn’t understand. Döpfner:  It´s  so obvious. But only in retrospect. Berners-Lee:  But then I’d show them a hypertext page, and I click on a link, and I go to another hypertext page. They say, „Big deal. You’ve got two hypertext pages.“ So what would happen is I would give a talk to a group of people, in an auditorium with 30 or 40 people, and most of the people would sort of nod and think another documentation system or something, but two or three people, you’d see their eyes crack. They’d think, „If everybody did this, this would be really neat.“ So they would come afterwards. After the questions, they’d come up and say, „Where do we get the software? Can we help?“ And so it spread. I suppose it spread in three dimensions. It spread to people who were interested in hypertext, which was an obscure form of backwater of the computing space, but there were some people who were interested in hypertext. So they were interested. I developed it on the NeXT, which was really rare. So people who had NeXT machines, they were able to download the thing over the Internet. And of course, physicists, I really had to try to make it appeal to this specific group. Döpfner:  Do you think that CERN was particularly privileged for such an invention, or could that have happened anywhere else? Berners-Lee:  I think it in a way could’ve happened anywhere else, but CERN was in a way a great place to try it out because it had... Döpfner:  ... experimental culture? Berners-Lee:  Yes there was. It had people who had the latest workstations on their desks because CERN would buy very powerful workstations with nice screens for doing the physics. So they ended up being useful to the World Wide Web. Because it didn’t have a strong hierarchy, it had people from different universities, different countries, those people came. So it was sort of a bit of a small-scale model of the rest of the world in its diversity, a lot of cultures, lots of different computer systems. So it had sort of the frustration of these incompatibilities. If it had been a big company, if it had been something like General Motors, then the manager would’ve said, „All right. We’re going to have a big central documentation system by next Thursday,  and everybody will use it.“ And that’s the end of the story. So it takes something very diverse. Döpfner:  Is there any advice that you could give to young people who have crazy ideas, who want to invent something great? Berners-Lee:  Well, CERN was a fortuitous place to be, but also, 1989 was a fortuitous time. The Internet was just coming. Here in Berlin, across a lot of the world, it was a time of massive change. The communities, the universities were getting actually connected together. I benefited from the work that Internet designers had done in building it as an open platform. Also, building it as a platform, I didn’t have to ask permission to use. So that’s true also of the Web. You don’t have to ask permission. If somebody out there has a brilliant idea, you can just go and think of a website you’d like to build. The way the Web works is you just get a computer, plug it into the Internet,  and design what the hell crazy website you like. You can be very creative. Really, it’s a challenge. If you’ve ever been to a website and felt that you could do better, well, you can. Go for it. It’s the openness, the permission of space. Döpfner:  Why did you decide not to patent your invention? Berners-Lee:  I knew from the beginning the goal was always to have one Web. If there was any commercial, if there were any royalties charged by whoever it was, then that company then would’ve become one of the Webs. Other companies would’ve immediately made incompatible versions of it. They would’ve built their own patents and own technology. Mathias Döpfner:  It could never get to a global standard. Berners-Lee:  I’d never get to the global standard. I wouldn’t get that key. Döpfner:  So it was not a moral decision at all. It was just  very logical, pragmatic... Berners-Lee:  It was a hard-nosed pragmatic decision, yes. Döpfner:  Did you ever think about how the Internet would look today without the World Wide Web? Perhaps as a kind of military tool for very few people? Berners-Lee:  We can never know.  Döpfner:  But would you agree that, basically, the World Wide Web transformed the basic invention of the Internet into a mass market success? Berners-Lee:  Well, the Internet allowed any two computers to communicate. The World Wide Web provided an information space for humanity to be connected. Because it was easy enough for ordinary people to use, it then pushed the Internet to people who in the geeky days would never have thought about buying a computer. You can remember what it was like with America Online, for example, perhaps the most successful of the walled gardens, but there were lots of them. There were dial-up bulletin boards, I think like Prodigy and Delphi, and then AOL was one. Each of those tried to be the single place that you go to for everything. When the Web came along, AOL got into trouble to a certain extent, first, they tried to pretend that the Web was a small thing and really part of AOL. Then people realized that AOL is part of the Web. However much effort they put into the walled garden, it could never compete with the crazy creativity. The classic AOL "yellow man" Flickr / Travis Wise Döpfner:  Before we go to the walled gardens of today: is it actually true that you were advised not to call it the World Wide Web because www is so difficult to pronounce in the English and French language? Berners-Lee:  I was certainly advised. People complained. WW was too much of a mouthful, but it was useful. Nobody else had thought of WWW, and it was unique. So we could count the number of Web servers, for example, just by counting the number of computers called www. Mathias Döpfner:  Did you consider any alternatives for the branding of this idea? Tim Berners-Lee:  I considered a few, well, Mine of Information. I called it The Information Mine because Mine of Information just in English is colloquial, conveys richness of things, of contents, but The Information Mine is TIM, which was a little bit too egocentric. Döpfner:  When the project was finished, did you realize that you developed something very big or was it more like: “this was an interesting project?” Berners-Lee:  This is still an interesting project. What are all the things we have to do to keep this project on track? So the phases, there’s never been a next. There’s never been, "Okay. The World Wide Web is now stable." Döpfner:  How close are we today to your original vision of it, and how far are we away from that? Berners-Lee:  Well, of course, the original vision didn’t foresee that the search algorithms would become so good. When people gave talks about the Web initially, the search engines were the butt of all the jokes because their results were terrible. But then the Google guys discovered this algorithm which looked at the links instead of the words.  Döpfner:  When did you meet the Google boys first? Berners-Lee:  I met Larry Page back a few years ago. Mathias Döpfner:  But not in the early days. They didn’t consult you? Tim Berners-Lee:  No, not at all. During those boom days, nobody had time to talk to anybody. Lots of things have happened that I could never have imagined. For example, the first maps that Steve Putz of Xerox PARC made were really clunky. You had to click to move the app, the whole thing. Then later on, you could switch the maps around. Now people using an online map find it so easy, and they’re so powerful, and they know when the buses run and everything. So we’ve come a huge long way. Döpfner:  What is the best thing so far that you have seen happening with and because of the World Wide Web and what is the worst? Berners-Lee:  I don’t put things in order. Döpfner:  If you don’t put it in order, is there any moment where you really had the feeling, "Oh my God, what they did, they simply abused my invention?" Berners-Lee:  One example of the system not really working as designed was the interaction between the for-pay advertising system and political system last year when these guys in Veles, Macedonia, just had websites where they were trying to attract traffic. They were using the Google Ad system. So Google would financially reward them very quickly if they could get more people to follow the links and click on more links. So these people during the election season, they ended up finding that, if you just wanted to tweet out a headline and get somebody to click on it, then the US election is definitely a great topic. Then the Google Ad system trained them just like you train a dog. In a way, it just gave them more money for the things which were more clickable. So they learned that untruth was more clickable than truth. Döpfner:  I think it was found out that Uber is tracking your movements not only while you are using the product, but they identify you or rather your mobile phone by means of a sort of digital fingerprint even if you deleted the app at some point. Is that something where you’d say, "Well, we should have expected that because everything that is doable will be done, and that’s all fine?" A sign is seen during a news conference to announce Uber resumes ride-hailing service, in Taipei Thomson Reuters Berners-Lee:  Absolutely not. No, I’m not one of those people. You might find Eric Schmidt, who famously says that privacy is over, get over it, but actually, no, I’m not one of those people. I believe that privacy is really fundamental to all. Döpfner:  Or they say that he who has nothing to hide has nothing to fear.  Berners-Lee:  Absolutely. That attitude is very sinister, but also, the idea that we have privacy only for things which we feel guilty about. We have privacy. Any company has things it discusses within the company. That’s how it functions. It can plan its new products. It can look at its successes and failures. You have groups within the company as well which don’t share things with the other groups.  Döpfner:  I think it’s an element of a free society that you have the freedom to define – within the framework of legality – what you want to share and what you don’t want to share within the framework of legality. If that is defined by other people, by political authorities, or by companies, actually, I think it is changing our model of free democracies. Berners-Lee:  Yes, exactly. Döpfner:  Would you agree that total transparency can lead to totalitarianism? Berners-Lee:  Well, that’s too simplistic. I don’t like to use the word transparency for that. If you’re having a meeting about how Berlin is going to fix the holes in the road and how much money should be spent on this, that should be public. It’s information by the public, for the public. The public is paying for it. So there is a duty of transparency. You don’t have the right to keep that private. I’m very much in favor of privacy. I think that Germany has been a great leader for the rest of the world in that case and so should hang in there. There have been times when Germany has led the EU into insisting on privacy throughout the European Union, and that’s been beneficial for everybody. Döpfner:  In a way, you could say there have been two iconic and culture-defining experiences in America and in Europe regarding privacy. In Europe, it’s the Holocaust. It is an example how total transparency was used an abused by the Nazis. They knew who was Jewish, where which Jews were living, what they did und thought. They registered and tracked each and every one of them, they even tattooed a number on their arms before putting them in a concentration camp. That was unlimited control, totalitarian transparency.  In contrast, the United States – their traumatic experience is 9/11. After 9/11,  in order to avoid terrorism of that kind, the most efficient way was total transparency. You know everything about your potential enemies, which means you know everything about your own population. You track everything. You spy on everything because that is considered to be the best way to avoid terrorism and ensure security. So it may be that these two traumatic experiences led to very different conclusions. Here is a deeply rooted sensitivity for too much transparency, there it cannot be enough transparency.   How do you experience these differences in mentality when talking to your colleagues in England and in the Silicon Valley? Berners-Lee:  So it is interesting to live half and half. When it came to open data, both the UK and the US were pretty good leaders. When it comes to privacy, then I think, to a certain extent, as I said, Europe has done better, but there are strong privacy guarantees in the States. The strongest things are the things that are constitutionally based. The most interesting example recently, when a loudspeaker manufacturer was taken to court, because when you listen to the speaker, if you use Spotify on your phone, you could hand off the Spotify playlist to that speaker using Spotify Connect, and then the speaker would then play it by itself. So the speaker would know which songs you were playing, and the speaker was reporting the songs to Bose, the manufacturer of the loudspeaker. So we noticed it. I tweeted about it. I don’t normally read the terms and conditions at all, but for the Bose speaker, I thought, "Why do I have to get an account at Bose just to use a loudspeaker?" And it turns out that they were monitoring them. So that is an example. They were successfully sued under wiretap laws, and they appealed to a high court, and they lost. So basically, the idea that you can do what Uber does, I think that the wiretap law is basically the interception of messages, and the interception of data is illegal in the States. Döpfner:  Some peope might be surprised, mainly because you can hardly be blamed for being anti-progress or anti-technology. It’s very difficult to say who should decide those questions of anonymity and accountability. Is it the company? Is it the legal system of a market, a country? I think that these developments are posing a whole set of completely new questions. Berners-Lee:  I think, by the way, that whereas initially it might be an AI, and then it may be the company, at the end of the day, the arbiter has to be the court system.  Döpfner:  Right. But was does that mean for fake news? Berners-Lee:  What’s the fake news? How do they define fake news in this case? Döpfner:  Well, that’s already where the problem starts. That means that, in the end, Facebook or another social media platform can define what fake news is, and I think it should always be the prosecutor and not a private company. Facebook should be a neutral platform. People exchange all kinds of things, good and bad, truth and lies. However, only if something is illegal, the prosecutor should intervene. If Facebook with its almost two billion users – ushered by well-intentioned politicians – morphs into a universal media monopoly making editorial decisions and even judging on who gets to read what, then we have a problem. And it is exacerbated if that happens in a closed system.  Berners-Lee:  Let’s talk first about a monopoly and then about data. We know about monopolies. Before the Web, there was the telephone system. A large number of countries had monopolies because that’s the way they decided to do the telephone system. It did mean that, if you were a telephone engineer and you had a brilliant idea and you weren’t working for the telephone company, you were out of luck because the telephone company was the only entity who’s allowed to sell telephones. But then they changed that and increased the amount of competition. Competition was improved. AT&T was broken up. Adam Berry / Stringer / Getty Images There was AOL, of course, which was pretty much a monopoly pre-Web. When the Web started, people were worried Netscape was far and away the most popular browser. So there was the concern that the company Netscape had potentially complete control over the whole Web until, one day, people turned around and realized that, actually, no, Microsoft not only has a dominant browser, but they have the operating system, and they’ve locked them together. So it’s worse. Why were they ever worried about it? Bring Netscape back in. So then they were worried about Microsoft, and they continued to be worried about Microsoft as being the dominant software player until, suddenly, they realized they weren’t worried about Microsoft anymore because they realized, no, it doesn’t matter which browser you use if you always go to the same search engine. So they worried about Google. Some, still worry about Google, but then some, they stopped worrying about Google because, actually, what people do is they Google Facebook, and they go to Facebook, and they spend the entire day on Facebook. Döpfner:  But that’s exactly the point. Berners-Lee:  There have always been monopolies. They have always been an issue. They’ve always been a concern. They have not always been permanent. Döpfner:  No, almost no monopoly in the history of business has been permanent. That’s why you could say we shouldn’t worry about monopolies because they will always be disrupted by other big aggressive players. In the long run, neither Standard Oil nor Bell Telephone Company survived as monopolies. Most of the monopolies were disrupted by competition, but in some cases, the regulator could help and had to help. Peter Thiel wrote that book on monopolies with an underlying theory or main theory that monopolies are for winners, and competition is for losers. Where is the balance? What should the regulator do in dealing with monopolies, basically leave it up entirely to the market because the market will resolve it in the long run, or restrict the dominant positions of certain players? Berners-Lee:  I think the antitrust system is really important. The market works while there’s a mix of people, while there’s a mix of big players and small players all in the same market. The moment that mix is gone, then the market’s not functioning anymore. Döpfner:  Is there a particular challenge for the digital world because of the effects of the network economy? There is that book by the famous Chief Economist of Google, Hal Varian, who used to be an independent professor and wrote a book about the network economy, where he basically proved that, in the digital world, you use or abuse your existing monopoly in order to create new monopolies because the old monopoly’s going to be disrupted. But if you let a player go that way too long, then the combination of monopolies with a search algorithm, with a browser, with devices and everything, can be simply too dominant. By the way: It’s funny that this principle has been implemented very systematically by Google. Berners-Lee:  I think one of the nice things about the digital world is the fact that the Internet was net neutral. The net was built as a neutral space without attitude. That’s why it has “permissionless”. That’s why I could build the WWW product on top of it. So the markets for the websites, the markets for content, the wide markets for whatever you build on top of the Web have been independent of the market for connectivity. So you could choose to get fiber at your house from a competing market without that affecting which movies you can watch tonight, so different from the American paid cable system, which the net replaced. So net neutrality has been a really, really important part of these new markets, but you can’t join them together. You shouldn’t bundle together the content. David McNew/Getty Images Döpfner: Are you advocating net neutrality without exception? Berners-Lee:  Yes. It’s been really important, and it is very important now. We should fight for it whenever it’s threatened, as it is currently under threat . Döpfner:  Again: How about the whole fake news phenomenon? How should society deal with that? Should publishers help Facebook to correct their fake news stories, or is it basically more about media education, that people should learn that not everything that is distributed on a social media platform is necessarily true? Berners-Lee:  I think we have to be very scientific and look at how these systems interact. The Macedonian websites we talked about earlier generated ad revenue by making up things about the US election, and affected that election even though their motivation was not at all political, only commercial. The ad network trained them that lies can generate more revenue than truth. As a system engineer, I look at that and say, "Well, now, something’s broken here." So one of the possibilities is for Google at that point to tweak the way they reimburse people not just on the clicks, but on some other function.  Döpfner:  So you could say the fact that Facebook is incentivizing people to distribute bad content, fake news, has to be changed in the very interest of the social media platform. Berners-Lee:  The guys in Veles, Macedonia, they were indepenent , they were not on Facebook. They were only on websites. They pointed at them with Twitter. So it wasn’t a Facebook phenomenon. There’s a separate Facebook phenomenon which I’m told was an important factor in the election. That is targeted advertising. Targeted advertising on social networks is very effective. There’s a blog. He claimed that what they did was divided the entire American voting population into 32 different subtypes, like Myers-Briggs, different sorts of people, different demographics, and so they could then send targeted information. So to one group with children, you’d say, "Our candidate is going to fight for education." Then there’s a group without children, and they can say, "Our candidate is going to save money by cutting down education"“ Because it’s targeted advertising, it’s not public so nobody can check. So one simple rule could be that you could say, actually, targeted advertising by political bodies is not democratic. Therefore, from now on, if you want to advertise as a political person, you have to say same thing to everybody because, that’s what democracy is. Döpfner:  You said at the very beginning that you think net-net, of course, the World Wide Web and the whole digitization of our society has more positive elements than negative ones, but among the negative ones, which is your biggest worry? A Turkey national flag is hung on a balcony in Istiklal Street near the scene of Saturday's bomb explosion, in Istanbul, Sunday, March 20, 2016. AP Photo/Emrah Gurel Berners-Lee:  I used to say blocking and spying and Web censorship. The censorship, of course, is bad, but if censorship is bad, spying is worse. The really bad regimes, they let you go to the sites they don’t like, and then they monitor you, and they find your family, throw you in jail. Döpfner:  Is there a government that is particularly worrying you? Berners-Lee:  Turkey is a classic example of blocking. They blocked Twitter, and they put it back on. I hope they realize that that’s no way to run a country and that it will just become so inefficient, and I imagine there will be protests. Döpfner:  Yeah, absolutely. And now they block Wikipedia. Berners-Lee:  That will be a battle. Some of the Middle Eastern countries have been pretty reprehensible in the past when it comes to spying on people and using that to round up their critics. Döpfner:  How about companies? Governments and their possibilities to manipulate and abuse data is one thing. The other thing is big international conglomerates that could also end up in the hands of certain governments. How do you see that? The first ring is governments, but the second ring is big companies, or are you less afraid by the role that big corporations are playing? Berners-Lee:  I’m just as afraid really. It’s funny. Growing up in the UK, and UK people have a fond trust of their government, but they’re deeply suspicious of companies. And in America... Döpfner:  …it’s the other way around. Berners-Lee:  Yes, they have a faith in corporations but are taught as children to distrust their government. I think the British contingent will end up overtrusting their government, and the Americans will end up overtrusting their corporations. Of course, sometimes, in China, it’s hard to tell the difference. Sometimes, in America, it’s hard to tell the difference, too. Döpfner:  But you are deeply rooted in the free market economy, aren’t you? Berners-Lee:  In the free market, yeah. Döpfner:  And free market needs competition. Berners-Lee:  It does need competition. Döpfner:  And diversity. Berners-Lee:  It does need to have a separate market for connectivity and for content. Döpfner:  To which degree will virtual reality, augmented reality change the Web and change the world? Is it hype, or is it a game changer? Berners-Lee:  In 1994 when we had the first Web conference at CERN, one of the sessions was on virtual reality, and it was on designing Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML). So we thought that, within a few years, by the end of the ’90s, all the websites would be 3D. They would just be so much more interesting. So I think it’s going to be really hard to make predictions. I think augmented reality is to an extent already there because when we use a map, then you have the ability to see more logical details about the things you’re looking at. Augmented reality will increase. Virtual reality, I think it would be great fun to try a world in which you and I can have this conversation. Döpfner:  Without being in the same room. Berners-Lee:  But where really the pixels or the stereoscopic system is so good, I really have to look at you very carefully to realize that you’re not here. Döpfner:  That you’re not here, yeah, and you can even have a certain simulation of the senses. Do you share the vision that, in a couple of years, maybe the normal conversation that people are having is not happening on the phone, it’s not happening through email? It is really happening like a virtual reality conversation where you basically meet without being in the same room? Berners-Lee:  I think a lot of people do that now. A lot of people meet on Skype and Facetime. Döpfner:  Yeah, but that’s a two-dimensional experience. You don’t really have the feeling, as you just described it, that you’re really sitting in the same room. Berners-Lee:  I don’t know. We’ll see. Döpfner:  So looking, let’s say, 50 years ahead, what will the world look like, particularly with regard to communication and the effects that digitization has on it? Berners-Lee:  Well, we’re at an interesting time now. The World Wide Web has been increasing exponentially, but now it’s got to 50 percent of the world. It’s pretty amazing that this proportion of the world is using it at all. We set up the Web Foundation a decade ago when the concern was that only 10% of t the world was using the Web. The challenge was the other 90%.   Now as we have got to 50% and people are getting online faster than ever, and soon the issues will change as they online world becomes the majority.  Then different things become a concern when most of sub-Saharan Africa villages are online, when 3G, 4G, 5G cell towers will be ubiquitous. People who can’t get online at that point will need a different sort of technology. There will be low earth orbit satellites, for example or something or balloons, but there has to be a new push to get them online. That push may have to be subsidized because those people will be in remote areas. But the problem will be that the discrimination against them will be much more intense because it’ll be so efficient for any company to assume their customers are online.. Döpfner:  So a widening gap? Isn’t digitization closing the gap? Berners-Lee:  A widening gap between those who have and those who don’t have because there will be a mounting assumption from anybody providing a service that you’re online. For a government or a company, just it will be economic nonsense to go to the trouble of catering to the people who haven’t bothered to connect. Döpfner:  But so far, until today, you could find very good facts and figures to prove the opposite theory, that digitization has closed the gap or that digitization has redistributed money from the wealthy to the not wealthy. Basically, if you look to the developing countries, they are more and more benefiting from digitization with regard to the accessibility of knowledge and the distribution of wealth. Berners-Lee:  It’s absolutely true, yes. No, I was talking about the last 10 percent. So as they benefit, yes, then the benefit to humanity is lots and lots of people can get healthcare information. It’s huge, clearly, although when you look at that sort of thing, you might see the benefit to the people who were poor are now less poor and are connecting throughout the developing countries. You might also look at where some of that money has all gone, and you might be very concerned about the economic distribution in the developed countries, which is worse than ever before. Döpfner:  The historian Yuval Harari just wrote a book called Homo Deus, where he basically says that mankind has had to deal for the last centuries with three main challenges. That was war, famine, and plagues. He said that these things are basically resolved. More people are dying from too much sugar than from not enough food. Never in history were less people dying from war and violence. most of the plagues are resolved because modern medicine has basically killed pests, pocks and almost everything. then he says the new project of mankind will be longevity or immortality. Is that something that you see as a big trend for the next decades if we’re speaking of a 50-year time horizon that people could live for 120, 150 years, or that they may even be able to live forever, like Ray Kurzweil has described it with his singularity theory? Is that something that you take seriously? Berners-Lee:  Yes, I do. Döpfner:  You do. That’s good news. Tell me why. Berners-Lee:  I take it seriously because, when I talk to people who build robots, they complain that it’s so hard to make them smart. They can’t imagine the singularity coming when they’ll be smarter than them. However, but when you step back and you look at the steps, the huge tasks that the AI community has checked off of machine understanding, machine translation, motion, all this planning, finding your way across a city, playing chess, that sort of thing, playing Jeopardy, diagnosing medical things, I feel that there’s certainly reason to imagine that the machines that we build will at some point become smarter than us. We have to decide what our priorities are and whether our priority is in fact to promote exclusively the human race or whether we’ll be promoting other machine intelligence. TED Döpfner:  So do you think, like Elon Musk, that there is a likelihood that artificial intelligence is going to be smarter than human intelligence and is going to win the battle? Berners-Lee:  I find it very hard to argue against that, yes. Döpfner:  So a last question, in that context: do you think that man and machine, robots and human beings are going to merge? Or is it more purely medical progress that makes it easier for people to live longer? Berners-Lee:  I think machine intelligence will help. It’ll be machines which aids, but a great intelligence I think will be designed by people, but it will be not a person in itself. Döpfner:  Timothy Berners-Lee is a living legend as an inventor of something that really has changed the world. Has that ever put pressure on you? Did it cause certain crises about your next projects or scientific research or invention? Berners-Lee:  Well, my day job for many years has been as the Director of W3C, and that has been a great community of people. It’s been very collaborative. It’s involved wonderful sparkling minds from across the industry getting together to build the Web from being the World Wide Web of static webpages as documents to webpages as programs and so webpages as a computer. Konrad Zuse invented the computer. In a way, what we’re doing is we’re making that invention but within the website. A webpage is now something you can program. So that’s been a huge change, been very exciting. Most of the time, in day-to-day life, people at W3C just know me as this guy who has got certain sometimes annoying personal feelings about how the architecture of the Web should be. People in the Lab, (MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, CSAIL), know me as another guy that builds things. Döpfner:  What’s the most important project that you’re working on at the moment? Is there anything that is particularly on top of your mind? Berners-Lee:  One of the things which we’re doing in the lab at MIT is we’re reacting to the world in which people don’t control their data by designing a technical solution that’s called Solid. The idea is that we imagine a world in which you completely control your data. So when you start an app, it says, „Where do you want to store it?“ I’ll store this on this computer, and I’ll store this in my Cloud. But whether it’s your computer or your Cloud, it completely reports to you, and you determine who gets to use it for what. So we’re imagining that world. It’s not just about privacy, but it’s much more about enabling you because we believe that the data that you have about yourself is actually more valuable to you than to anybody. Döpfner:  What are the books that you’re reading? You’re reading scientific literature, history books, or also novels, and if so, which? Berners-Lee:  I read all kinds of stuff, but I suppose I rarely read a book from beginning to end. I get pointed at so many things. I follow a few news sources on Twitter of reliable news. Random people introduce me to things. I’m in lots of different discussions on different media. Döpfner:  Is there any book that changed your life? Berners-Lee:  It would be tempting to talk about Enquire Within Upon Everything, but really, that was just the title of the book. The book didn’t change my life.  that was a Victorian book in which it was a sort of a Wikipedia. It was on my parents’ shelves, and I used it as a programmer as a title for the program I made in 1980 way back then in the days of green screens, so Enquire Within Upon Everything. Mathias Döpfner:  Do you believe in God? Tim Berners-Lee:  Not in the sense of most people. I’m atheist and Unitarian Universalist.

Ask an Expert - By Digital Trends Staff   Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Are Android devices really easier to hack? We… Are Android devices really easier to hack? We asked the experts By Simon Hill — May 7, 2017 3:00 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Android is the most widely used mobile platform on the planet. More than 1.4 billion people use an Android smartphone or tablet every single day, and the fact that it’s open source and free for manufacturers to use is a big part of that popularity. But openness is a double-edged sword: It has led to a situation where many Android phones are not regularly updated with the latest security patches. The specter of malware has loomed large over Android for the last few years, with researchers uncovering very high profile vulnerabilities, like Stagefright. The negative news comes so thick and fast that it can be hard to put into perspective. Just last week we reported on FalseGuide malware, which may have impacted up to 1.8 million Android users. Going on the headlines alone, you’d be forgiven for having misgivings about Android security, but where’s the line between hyperbole and genuine risk? Is the platform really insecure? “No, it’s not insecure. I do think we have a bit of a perception problem, but it’s very different from actual user risk,” Adrian Ludwig, director of Android Security, told Digital Trends in a recent interview. “The cryptographic work that we’ve been doing, the sandboxing that we’ve been doing, and a lot of the work to make exploitation more difficult is all coming together nicely.” There’s little doubt that the most recent versions of Android are more secure than their predecessors, but the problem is that many Android users never feel the benefit. Looking back on 2016 in a blog post, the Android security team admitted that roughly half of the devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received an update for at least 12 months. “Eighty-four percent of phones are not upgraded, which means most mobile devices are still at risk.” “Up-to-date versions of Google Android can be considered secure,” Maik Morgenstern, CEO of antivirus rating organization AV-Test, told Digital Trends. “But especially in many older Android versions, more and more vulnerabilities are surfacing and many vendors don’t supply updates for their devices. Currently, over 800 vulnerabilities are known.” If we look at the official distribution figures for Android as of April, we find that only 4.9 percent of Android devices run the latest versions, Nougat 7.0 or 7.1. That’s a disappointingly small slice of the total. Looking further back, Android 6.0 Marshmallow is running on 31.2 percent of devices, Android 5.0 or 5.1, Lollipop, is on 31 percent of devices, and a fifth of Android devices are still running Android 4.4 KitKat. Most of these devices running older versions of Android are unlikely to ever be updated. “Eighty-four percent of phones are not upgraded, which means most mobile devices are still at risk,” Joshua J. Drake, vice president of Platform Research and Exploitation at Zimperium, told Digital Trends. Zimperium is a mobile security company; Drake uncovered the Stagefright vulnerability back in 2015. It had the potential to give hackers control of an Android device through malicious code in an audio or video file — and up to 95 percent of devices were vulnerable to it, according to reports at the time. Drake told us that less than 1 percent of devices are still vulnerable today. Although the potential damage was frightening, it’s unclear what the impact on Android users was. “Here we are a year and a half in, almost going on two years since we first found out about it, and we still don’t know that anybody’s actually affected,” Ludwig said. But Drake disagrees. Maik Morgenstern, CEO and Technical Director of AV Test “We know that there were targeted attacks using vulnerabilities in libstagefright and mediaserver,” he said. “We know it’s hard to prove a negative in general, and we respect Google’s efforts to better secure their platform, but without a sensor on the device, there is no way for anyone to know the risk or threat status of any device — especially a mobile one.” The problem is that it’s not easy to tell if you have been successfully attacked. In the aftermath of the Stagefright discovery, the security firm founded the Zimperium Handset Alliance to boost communication between researchers, mobile network operators, mobile application developers, and device vendors. “Researchers need to be encouraged to look into monthly security updates, and try to exploit those vulnerabilities, in order to promote better patching and an overall safer mobile world,” Drake said. Google has taken some important steps to reduce security risks, putting out monthly patches and breaking down elements of Android to make it easier to push out updates. But older versions of Android have been left behind. The Android fragmentation problem is not easily solved. Persuading carriers and manufacturers to update their Android devices has proven to be very difficult for Google. It has played directly into the opposition’s hands. Apple’s Tim Cook famously referenced a ZDNet article entitled “Android fragmentation turning devices into a toxic hellstew of vulnerabilities” on a slide at WWDC in 2014. But is iOS really that much better? And if so, why? “There has been the impression that iOS security is superior to Android security, but that’s not necessarily the case,” Drake said. Because Android is open-source, it’s easier for security researchers to find flaws and suggest fixes. The closed nature of iOS makes it harder for researchers to see what’s going on, he said. Morgenstern agrees with this assessment, but points to an important difference that makes malware a greater risk for Android. “Until every update reaches all devices, we are still at risk.” “For Android users, it is easy to install apps from any source,” explains Morgenstern. “This fact makes it easy to get malicious apps onto the device. The way other platforms handle this is much stricter, by only allowing installations from their closed markets.” Android is a big target. With such a large user base and open-source code, it’s attractive prey for cybercriminals. AV-Test registers up to 30,000 new Android malware samples every day. That’s a frightening number, but concerned Android users can take action to dramatically reduce the risks by sticking to Google Play for apps, updating devices as soon as patches are made available, and using third-party Android security apps. Both Drake and Morgenstern also caution against connecting to unknown networks and Wi-Fi hotspots, at least without using decent Android VPN apps. “Our data shows that most attacks are network in nature, and they don’t discriminate between iOS, Android, or other,” Drake explains. “Once an attacker has silently intercepted and redirected your network traffic, any device is dangerously vulnerable to invasive surveillance, personalized spear fishing, platform exploit delivery, or any number of other follow-on attacks.” Android security is improving. We can point to faster updates, device encryption, permission requests, app sandboxing to isolate apps from each other, restricted access to resources, and automatic malware scanning in the Play Store. But there’s obviously still work to be done. “Last year we paid almost a million dollars to researchers,” Google’s Ludwig said, when asked about the importance of third-party research. But despite this research program, Drake feels more is needed.   “To improve Android security overall, it’s imperative for Google to work closer with security vendors,” he said. “Apple and other vendors have increased their cooperation, but Google has decreased it. Google’s philosophy is that they can do everything on their own, but that only damages their users and unfortunately benefits malware authors.” Ultimately, the question of Android security may come down to the device you use. If you have a two or three-year-old phone that runs an older version of Android and hasn’t been updated in months, you have cause for concern. Owners of Google’s Pixel, by contrast, receive the latest security updates in a timely fashion, at least for the next couple of years. It’s hard to say how long it will be before most Android devices are running Nougat, or a later version of Android, but even then the slow pace of updates from some manufacturers and carriers will remain an issue. “Until every update reaches all devices, we are still at risk,” Morgenstern said.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Will your watch get Android Wear 2.0? Read our… Will your watch get Android Wear 2.0? Read our guide to find out Android Wear 2.0 is now rolling out to LG Watch R and 1st-gen Watch Urbane By Julian Chokkattu — May 6, 2017 5:23 AM Subscribe Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends After announcing it at I/O 2016, Google is finally launching Android Wear 2.0, a major revamp that’s meant to breathe new life into the company’s smartwatch platform. The release — which was delayed several months so Google could fine-tune the software — has had five developer previews since May, all of which were only compatible with the Huawei Watch and the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE. Many manufacturers decided to hold off on debuting a new smartwatch until Google released the update, which is partly why there were few new smartwatches last year. This year looks to be different, though. February saw the release of the LG Watch Style and Watch Sport, the first two smartwatches designed in close collaboration with Google to run Android Wear 2.0, much like the company’s Nexus devices.  Many other watches have been announced since then, such as the Huawei Watch 2 and its predecessor, the Huawei Watch; Casio’s WSD-F20; Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45; and more. But not everyone can afford to purchase a new smartwatch. When can we expect the update to roll out on existing smartwatches? Read on to find out. Which watches get the update? All new smartwatches going forward will launch with Android Wear 2.0, such as the Huawei Watch 2, and a number of older watches are slated to get an update. It won’t be right away, though. According to Google, a bug in final testing has delayed the update. “We will push the update to [the remaining] devices as soon as the issue is resolved,” a company spokesperson said in March. Still, Android Wear 2.0 continues to trickle out. Here’s a list of the older watches that are getting it. Watches that have received the update LG LG Watch R LG Watch Urbane Fossil Fossil Q Founder Fossil Q Marshall Fossil Q Wander Fossil updated its portfolio of smartwatches to Android Wear 2.0 beginning in mid-March. Tag Heuer Tag Heuer Connected Casio Casio WSD-F10 Nixon Nixon Mission Polar Polar M600 Michael Kors Michael Kors Access Bradshaw Michael Kors Access Dylan New Balance New Balance RunIQ Huawei Huawei Watch Watches that will receive the update later this year Lenovo Moto 360 2nd Gen Moto 360 for Women Moto 360 Sport We’ve reached out to Lenovo about the timing of its Android Wear 2.0 updates. Asus  Asus ZenWatch 2 Asus ZenWatch 3 Asus told Digital Trends that its smartwatches will be updated to Android Wear 2.0 in the second quarter of 2017. LG LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE Polar said that its high-end Android Wear watch, the M600, will receive Android Wear 2.0 in the spring. The update will also pack Polar-specific features, like a swim-tracking mode that will measure metrics such as distance, pace, strokes per minute, stroke length, and strokes per pool length. It will even tout support for additional languages, a newly designed interface, and boost battery life to 36 hours. Next Page 1 of 2 Which watches get the update? What features are new?

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 103 Plus 1 on G+ 370 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares578 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera.

It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2.

John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services.

Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery.

Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 32 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares177 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. Jay In my case, I created the account for my kid just to reserve the name so that by the time he's old enough he doesn't have to have [email protected] I also use it to write to him so he's got emails from me throughout his whole life that he can go back and read one day. Finally, though the email address is his name, it's *my* account until I choose to hand it over, therefore it's not violating any guidelines or terms since I'm over 13 and the other info on the account is mine. Rather than add "his" Google Account to my family account, what I'm hoping Google will do is allow me to transfer "my" other, existing Google account to him now under the family account. You're using semantics to make it seem like he's using an account he shouldn't have against the rules, and that's not the case in my situation. SBBH I've done the exact same thing and also wish Google would make this work with existing emails. Violet There's also the fact that in order for an Android phone to work, you have to have a Google account. So, if your kids get phones before they're thirteen, there's going to be some fudging of birth years during setup. SBBH Yep, not sure why they've waited so long to address this when for years now every kid has had a phone and because of that an email address. I know there are administrator and guest accounts or something like that (can't remember the exact names) in Android but I've found it often doesn't work as advertised or the older phones simply don't support it. I think the government also needs to update the laws a bit when it comes to this. IMHO AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

Unable to use my GSuite account for their Family Plan let alone Family Link. jj14x Gsuite - "A set of intelligent apps including Gmail, Docs, Drive and Calendar to connect the people in *your company*, no matter where in the world they are."

Infamous_Elsa It still needs app restrictions and website blocking like iOS Tired_Guy I have maybe an unusual situation but likely not and I did bring it to Google's attention but... My son is 25 but IDD and is like a big 5 year old. He does not yet have a legal guardian, but seriously, he will forever be a minor. I set him up a gmail account for his tablet and because many social services ask for one and it's nice to let him have one of his "own". The mail comes to me anyway. He gets music off the family plan google play and Red and we can keep his music and video choices separate from ours. Having an account means we can set him up on a new device pretty quickly at least as his favorite stuff goes. But a lot of what FL offers is stuff I'd love to be able to do in one place rather than doing it all ad hoc. Trust me, if I die, his mom isn't going to deal with the hows and whys of managing his account, access, email, browsing etc. And yes, app restrictions would be such a bonus as the existing stuff out there really sucks and I'm constantly getting the kid off the password screes and back to his video because he his something he shouldn't have. But beyond COPA and age 13, tere are a ton of parents like me with adult children who are disabled who'd love to be able to allow their kids internet access while managing it for them.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, May 08, 2017 - Page 14　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Warren Buffett addresses arena crowd ONE THAT GOT AWAY:Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s top two executives acknowledged that they missed out on investing in Google years ago, but expressed pride in their firm AP, OMAHA, Nebraska Listening to chief executive officer Warren Buffett never gets old for the thousands of Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders who filled an arena on Saturday to listen to the billionaire investor at the company’s annual meeting. More than 30,000 people came to Omaha to hear Buffett and Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger talk. The 86-year-old CEO and his 93-year-old partner have been leading the conglomerate for more than five decades, but the crowd is always listening for new nuggets of wisdom. Buffett is known for his candor and plain speaking. Berkshire’s top two executives on Saturday acknowledged that they missed out on investing in Google years ago, but they expressed pride in the company they built through acquisitions and said they believe it would thrive for decades to come. “In retrospect, I think we were smart enough to figure out Google early, and we didn’t,” Munger said. Buffett and Munger avoided technology investments for most of their careers because they said it was too hard to figure out which companies would win. Berkshire now owns 133 million Apple Inc shares, but it just sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM Corp shares, saying that Buffett had misjudged that firm. Buffett had harsh words for Wells Fargo & Co managers who failed to respond promptly to a sales practices scandal that cost the then-chief executive officer his job last year. The bank last fall said that its employees opened up 2 million bank accounts without customer approval to meet unrealistic sales goals. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it,” Buffett said. Berkshire is Wells Fargo’s biggest shareholder. Buffett said he still believes in the long-term prospects of the bank even though Wells Fargo mishandled the scandal. Buffett said there is no change in Berkshire’s plan to eventually replace him, adding that one of the most important qualities his successor would need is a talent for wisely investing Berkshire’s cash. “We need a money mind as CEO,” said Buffett, who has no plans to retire. Berkshire plans to name one of its existing managers chief executive officer after Buffett is gone and the decentralized structure of the company allows Berkshire’s subsidiaries to largely run themselves. “We have an extraordinary group of good managers,” Buffett said. The executives who run Berkshire subsidiaries look forward to the meeting just as the shareholders do. Brooks Running chief executive officer Jim Weber said he is always careful about how much of Buffett’s time he takes up when he talks to him, so those conversations tend to focus just on Brooks’ running-shoe business. The annual meeting offers one of the few times Weber gets to hear Buffett discuss other topics. “I want to hear him talk about the economy and investing,” Weber said. “I’m looking forward to hearing him as much as everybody else.” Dozens of companies Berkshire owns set up booths in an adjoining 18,580m2 exhibit hall to sell their products and take questions about their businesses. The event offers Geico insurance quotes, See’s Candy, Justin cowboy boots, recreational vehicles and homes manufactured by Clayton Homes. “I think it’s a neat way to keep the enthusiasm up in shareholders,” said Jerry Meyer, who drove to Omaha with family from Coffeyville, Kansas. Buffett is the celebrity that everyone wants to get close to at the meeting. When Buffett toured the exhibit hall, he was surrounded by a pack of reporters, shareholders and security officers. While Buffett met Mr Peanut at the Kraft Heinz booth, Miami Dolphin player Ndamukong Suh wandered about 1m away without a crowd. This story has been viewed 1566 times. Comments will be moderated.

By Eric Chiu @eric_chiu On 05/07/17 AT 12:41 PM Close Last week's Google Docs phishing attack sent waves across social media, as users including journalists, academics and employees from high-profile corporations were affected. As part of the phishing attempt, users received an email with an invite to a Google Doc that appeared to be from a person they would know. The email then directs users to authorize a fake Google app that's hosted on an actual Google page. Once the app is authorized, the attacker can then draw from a user's contacts to send the offending email to even more people.  Read: Email Attack Hijacks User Accounts By Posing As Google Docs Google has since clamped down on the exploit, but the attack's quick scale is a strong reminder about how difficult phishing attacks can be to spot. Phishing refers to an email or other message from a third party that imitates being from a reputable source, but which wants to deceive you into revealing personal information or credentials. International Business Times talked with Betsy Cooper, executive director of the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkley, about phishing and the Google Docs attack. Google has addressed the recent Google Docs phishing scam. Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach What do hackers traditionally do with data gained from phishing attacks? Betsy Cooper: What happened in this case is that essentially, people received an email that looked like it came from someone within their network, because that person in turn had basically fraudulently given away their contact information. And so, you get an email that looks like it’s coming from someone that you know and it asks you to click on a Google document. And when you click on that, it actually apparently was installing some sort of application on your device that would give it access to your Gmail account and to your contacts, as well as the password that you had used for that account. So in essence, what the scammers are hoping to get out of this is first, access to your contact network so they can spam more people and make it look like it comes from someone that those people know. And second, they’re hoping to get some sort of information like passwords, which a lot of people reuse in multiple places, which makes it even more exciting because once they get the password for one thing, they might be able to get access to other aspects of the person’s online life. How are phishing attempts like the Google Docs attack able to spread so quickly? BC: A sophisticated attack will do the best it can to make it look as though it’s coming from the real source, so in this case, the email that people received looked like it could have come from Google Docs. It wasn’t exactly identical, but it did look similar to Google Docs and that encourages people to have a sense of security that this is a legitimate message. Second, of course, is the familiarity of the person, so they use peoples' contact lists to encourage you to recognize that it was someone from your network, so you’re more likely to trust the message and click on it then. On the other hand, there are certain flags: oftentimes, spammers have typos or they look illegitimate. There was one such flag in this message, which is that it had sort of like a bunch of Hs, it was also sending to a bunch of Hs at protonmail or something like that [referring to the original Google Docs email being addressed to hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com], so in that case, that’s a flag because you don’t normally get emails that look like that, so that signals that something’s up. Read: Google Releases Statement On Phishing Scam, Adds Security To Gmail Android App And if you looked at the certificate as well, the certificate did not seem to come from Google, it seemed to come from something that was made to look like Google but it didn’t look quite right as well. So, somebody who dug into the source of the email might’ve seen something funny, so those were two flags on the other side and the fewer flags that you have to decrease your comfort, the more likely it is that more people are going to click on the email. The Google Docs email also used a sophisticated approach to mimic an official Google page. Is this unique for phishing attempts?  BC: I wouldn’t say it’s common, but it definitely exists. More broadly, it's a very common technique of phishing schemes to try to pretend that it is an organization with which you engage regularly: your bank or your email client or something like that in order to try to get you to have that level of comfort that you want to input your information. So, I think that more generally is quite common even if Google Docs itself isn’t the most common source. Finally, I think the requesting permissions was another flag. Normally, if you just log into a Google Doc, you don’t have to give permissions, you’re not logging into an app — you would just either already be logged in or you’d have to input your username and password, but the permissions thing should have been a flag for people. Obviously, that was a flag, but that is a more complex type of phishing scheme than the normal one you see. The normal one you see is often trying to get people to think that this is their IT manager and they need to give their password over to unlock the account. This was far from perfect, but it was still a level or two up from other phishing schemes, which, frankly, was why it was so successful. What precautions can users take against these types of phishing attempts? BC: First, really look for those signs that something is from a trusted user and if there’s something that looks funny, like the [repeated "h"'s in the Google Doc email], that should automatically be a signal and you should double check with your IT people before clicking on any link. A lot of people, when they see something funny, they don’t automatically assume that it’s a problem and they go ahead and click on it anyways and the opposite should be true. If you’re not sure, you shouldn’t click. You should also make sure that you’re expecting to receive something, trusting your instincts and waiting until you can check are two really important things. Second, people should really use two-factor authentication as much as possible and that serves at least two purposes: First, it makes it harder for someone to get into your legitimate accounts. If you have your email password and then you have to input something on your phone, the person needs access to your phone in order to be able to get to it in most cases, so that makes the standard a lot harder. But the other thing that two-factor authentication does is, it should trigger your comfort levels if it’s not requesting two-factor when you’re using those fake systems. So in the case here, it was asking for permissions, it wasn't asking for your password and then your mobile device. It should trigger to you that it’s different than the normal way you log into that system and should really get you interested in moving forward.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well.

JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery.

Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess.

Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 103 Plus 1 on G+ 370 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares578 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera.

It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card.

John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 32 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares177 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. Jay In my case, I created the account for my kid just to reserve the name so that by the time he's old enough he doesn't have to have [email protected] I also use it to write to him so he's got emails from me throughout his whole life that he can go back and read one day. Finally, though the email address is his name, it's *my* account until I choose to hand it over, therefore it's not violating any guidelines or terms since I'm over 13 and the other info on the account is mine. Rather than add "his" Google Account to my family account, what I'm hoping Google will do is allow me to transfer "my" other, existing Google account to him now under the family account. You're using semantics to make it seem like he's using an account he shouldn't have against the rules, and that's not the case in my situation. SBBH I've done the exact same thing and also wish Google would make this work with existing emails. Violet There's also the fact that in order for an Android phone to work, you have to have a Google account. So, if your kids get phones before they're thirteen, there's going to be some fudging of birth years during setup. SBBH Yep, not sure why they've waited so long to address this when for years now every kid has had a phone and because of that an email address. I know there are administrator and guest accounts or something like that (can't remember the exact names) in Android but I've found it often doesn't work as advertised or the older phones simply don't support it. I think the government also needs to update the laws a bit when it comes to this. IMHO AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

I set him up a gmail account for his tablet and because many social services ask for one and it's nice to let him have one of his "own". The mail comes to me anyway. He gets music off the family plan google play and Red and we can keep his music and video choices separate from ours. Having an account means we can set him up on a new device pretty quickly at least as his favorite stuff goes. But a lot of what FL offers is stuff I'd love to be able to do in one place rather than doing it all ad hoc. Trust me, if I die, his mom isn't going to deal with the hows and whys of managing his account, access, email, browsing etc. And yes, app restrictions would be such a bonus as the existing stuff out there really sucks and I'm constantly getting the kid off the password screes and back to his video because he his something he shouldn't have. But beyond COPA and age 13, tere are a ton of parents like me with adult children who are disabled who'd love to be able to allow their kids internet access while managing it for them.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares197 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. LondonLeedsFan Absolutely. Release a product, sell it at full price, and provide us with a limited, half-baked and delayed service. Thanks Google! xyz First of all, you should know that no one gives a shit about your feelings. Anyway, nothing funnier than people who are ignorant about everything outside their borders lecturing people on their country's law and regulations. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? LondonLeedsFan Mate, if you want Downton Abbey, you're more than welcome to it! ;) Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english? Lars Jeppesen Yes, language is US English, also on my phone LondonLeedsFan We don't even have podcasts on Play Music yet in the UK. Tiuri Elvander For some reason I just got them this weekend. Go to the Play Music website and log out and log in again. Maybe if you have a secondary google account, try that and then return to your main account. I logged in using my dad's account and then when I logged in using my own account again, I got the new look (mid 2016 look) Play Music, including podcasts! Srujan Probably for those panicking over losing healthcare protection on their pre-existing conditions. ericshmerick We get it, you don't like him. Your post is wholly inaccurate by the way. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing.

Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! Jack Smith Wow! Thanks. Never realized you could do this. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd. Paul Quinn I debated on that. I think I prefer the ominous nature of it. Reminds me of THE Borg. xyz It's appropriate because now Google can listen to everything you say at home. Nick Riviera It works terribly, like quite a few new services. Amit Interesting. No such issues for me. I haven't found home to falter even once, from what I asked for... el conejo Don't worry I'll place a logic bomb called "America Only" and that sh*t will blow up your network trafficking toolkit Paul Quinn We've updated the article because some of you are able to get this to work outside the US. Thanks for that info! Zsolt V How about checking first before spreading FUD? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. CD RW can't wait to have my nightly ASMR from Google Badouken I've been using this when reading, it makes for a relaxing read. surethom Does not work here in the UK. Unless u have to pay for subscription which I don't. Blake Sinnett They need to add this. https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA Paul Quinn Totally! Tell your Home.... Say, "Hey Google, I want to give feedback." Jack Smith Are you not the author? Are you not suppose to know the device? The poster can do this on the GH no problem and should that not be the answer? Jack Smith You can use it and I do similar with others. Just ask your GH to play it. Most nights we listen say at bedtime "hey google play 10 hours of thunderstorms" and it plays it from YouTube. But thanks for sharing because this is what I will use this evening for sure. Hope the wife does not mind. Jack Smith Love the ambient sounds built-in. But my preference right now is the 10 hours of thunderstorms with flutes from YouTube. Highly recommend. The problem with the others is they do not last long enough. Jack Smith Well re-reading article I am a dork. Never thought to ask for a time period with the built-in white noise. Jack Smith This is not a US only thing you just can play ambient or white noise from YouTube and we do it all the time. Tons more selection and some really good ones. But I really wish the author would know the GH better and share such things. Everytime he writes on the GH drives me nuts as pretty much every time there is incorrect information or something misleading or key points missing and has to be cleaned up in the comments area. Why? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. The difference here (and the point of the article) was that the GH has this feature built in and includes the ability to set a timer with it. The GH has always been able to play audio tracks of any kind. I guess I could have mentioned this alternate means of playing ambient sound in a sentence. Thanks for the feedback! I am new to this so it all just fine tunes my writing! Cory S If you tell it to play it to a chromecast, they appear to just be existing youtube videos.

Food tech investments plummeted from $500 million in 2015 to $80 million. Ananya Bhattacharya, qz.com Published May 06, 2017.   Neil Hall/Reuters May 06, 2017.   Ananya Bhattacharya, qz.com Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print India’s food-tech scene has been quite the party – but the guest list is starting to become more and more exclusive. Many nascent companies that set up shop during food tech’s heyday in 2014 could not deal with growing pains and started falling like dominoes in 2015: In October, delivery startup Dazo shuttered. Bengaluru-based delivery platform Eatlo closed its platform in December, barely a year after it launched. Others resorted to drastic measures to stay afloat. For instance, online food-delivery startup Swiggy started testing surge pricing à la Uber and Mumbai-based on-demand delivery firm TinyOwl laid off hundreds of employees and shut operations in a number of cities to streamline its business. In a candid blog post, Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of the Yelp-like restaurant-discovery and ordering platform Zomato, which fired around 300 employees – 10% of its workforce – amid slipping valuations and widening losses, labeled 2015 “truly our year of learning.” In 2016, the bloodbath continued. Food tech investments plummeted from $500 million in 2015 to $80 million. Consolidation became the flavor of the season: In June 2016, TinyOwl was acquired by hyperlocal-delivery startup RoadRunnr; the two merged into a new company, Runnr. In December, Delivery Hero acquired rival FoodPanda. A slew of other startups –Zupermeal, iTiffin, EazyMeals, Zeppery, BiteClub – all bit the dust. This year, as food tech strives to get back on its feet, two Silicon Valley behemoths – Google and Uber – have chosen to dance in the rain in India: Google launched Aero, a restaurant delivery and home services platform, in early April. Uber followed suit on May 2, announcing that its on-demand food-delivery arm UberEATS was going live. The question is, will they ride the waves or will they go under? The playing field Entering the industry in the current climate looks like a recipe for disaster at first glance. In 2016, 56 deals – cumulatively worth over $88 million – were made in the food-tech space, according to data financial-research platform VCCEdge shared with Quartz. The first quarter of 2017 saw far fewer deals and a much lower total investment than the same quarter in 2016. However, the market doesn’t seem to only be spiraling down: Compared to Q4 2016, the total amount invested in Q1 2017 actually increased by over $5 million. Source: VCCEdge A food-tech company succeeds by being at the “right intersection of innovation, speed, and cost,” said Venkat Shastry, a partner at global executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles’ Bengaluru office. Speed and cost seem relatively easy for big tech firms because of their deep pockets, technological prowess, and established sophisticated delivery mechanisms. But logistics is only half the story – companies need to innovate by developing a core understanding of Indian customer preferences. “For example, Unilever, Pepsi, and KFC made long-term investments in the market to customise experiences and appeal to the Indian customer’s palate,” Shastry said. To succeed, Uber and Google similarly will need to create a delivery model that caters to the price-sensitive, cash-dependent Indian customer. At the outset, both companies are being cautious and feeling out the market. So far, the online food delivery startups that have been successful have had their achievements concentrated in a handful of regions – more than 80% of orders come from the top five cities in India, according to a study published by Bengaluru-based RedSeer Consulting. Learning from the domestic companies that tried and failed to penetrate a large number of markets, Google and Uber are focusing on urban centers for now. The search giant has launched operations in India’s IT and commercial hubs – Bengaluru and Mumbai respectively. Uber’s food delivery service is just available to Mumbaiites for now. The upper hand Experienced Silicon Valley players do have a leg up on their Indian counterparts when it comes to time- and cost-efficiency. Amazon’s massive $5 billion investment in India’s e-commerce space is a drop in the ocean for the $430 billion dollar e-tailer, but completely eclipses anything local companies could spend. The e-commerce sector’s fate will likely play out in food delivery to some extent: Google and Uber can easily bite into local players’ market share by slicing prices, thanks to their massive capital base from their global operations. For instance, an UberEats customer doesn’t have to fill a minimum order size and will pay a Rs15 ($0.23) delivery fee – half of Swiggy’s Rs 30 to Rs 40 ($0.47 to $0.62) delivery charge (for orders below a certain amount). Having lots of capital also means you can take more risks. If Google’s food delivery doesn’t take off, its home-services section that lets people order plumbers, electricians, or painters, might still become a hit. As less successful startups get weeded out and larger international players make huge monetary and infrastructure commitments, it may feel like local entrants have no hope. But that’s not true. Local flavor Although the likes of Google and Facebook are making moves to bring more Indians online, only 26% of the population has access to internet. Brands like Uber and Google that are household names in the US are still not commonplace in many parts of India. And if the brands can’t reel in customers on the basis of their names, they have to compete more fiercely at a local level. “The biggest barriers [are] the local Indian restaurants who have been traditionally already doing the delivery service…[and] which already have an established network,” Shalini Prakash, of the India-based accelerator 500 Startups, told Quartz. Domestic services like Swiggy and Runnr already partner with a wide variety of restaurants. Even though there are no rules against restaurants selling on multiple platforms, customers may not switch delivery services – even if it’s cheaper – out of loyalty, convenience, or simple lack of awareness. Another way upcoming domestic businesses can compete is to “look it into unique food products which becomes their USP [unique selling point],” said Prakash, citing the Mumbai-based startup Raw Pressery, one of the first – and highest-funded – companies to package and deliver cold-pressed juices. In a country with 29 states where people speak at least 22 different languages and eat many different kinds of cuisines, there are myriad unexplored local and international food options that are still open to tech companies who can do them right, Prakash said. And let’s not forget that food tech is more than just online delivery – and non-delivery services is an area where local companies appear better placed to succeed. According to VCCEdge, funding in the first quarter of 2017 backed a diverse range of startups – from those processing and packing fresh meats to those delivering run-of-the-mill household products like milk and eggs to others offering platforms to book professional chefs. Starting fresh “India is like the wild West right now,” said Sandeep Murthy, co-founder of Mumbai-based Lightbox VC. “So many businesses have been serving such a massive consumer need in such a fragmented way.” With the advent of technology, the sector is looking for businesses that can deliver consistent, scalable value over time. Beyond pizza chain Domino’s, India doesn’t really have highly penetrative brands in its food sector, Murthy notes. There are also no mega brands waiting to fill the space. “[In the US, I watch] some reporter talking about Amazon eating somebody else’s lunch…they’re always talking about old world retailers figuring out how to grow their business online,” said Murthy. Indian food tech companies won’t run into that problem. “If you think about who would the old-world guy be [in India], there’s no one.” This means new brands and chains can build themselves up on tech-enabled platforms directly. Startups operating on a kitchen-based model, wherein they cook, package, and deliver the food, are cut out for success. Controlling the quality of food keeps customers coming back and keeps these startups in the running while services that aggregate restaurant choices and do last-mile delivery are the ones fading out, according to Murthy. (He admits he’s biased. Lightbox VC backs on-demand food startup Faasos, which makes and delivers meals to customers’ homes from 9am to midnight daily across 15 Indian cities.) The American companies likely won’t cannibalize these kinds of businesses. In fact, Murthy views them as another retail avenue for local businesses. “It’s great. Let them distribute our product as well,” Murthy said. There’s still room for plenty more players, as long as they have a clear-cut business model that can work with or despite Google and Uber. “Pick your aspect, pick your strength, and try to compete,” said Murthy. “Whoever’s got the best pick and shovel can do some damage and find the right gold.” This article first appeared on Quartz.

Before moving to Dubai five months ago, Mr Cattaruzzi worked for the tech company in Mexico, Ireland, Argentina and the United States. He has also held managerial positions at AOL Latin America. Last week, the 42-year-old from Argentina gave a talk to children at Swiss International School in Dubai, where his own two children go to school. During the hour-long session, he fielded questions from pupils about what it is really like to work in the top echelons of Google, which has more than 60,000 employees. These are some of the questions they asked: What do you look for in an employee? We have four dimensions – how smart they are, how much they know about what they would be doing, leadership potential and what we call "Googliness", which is respect for people’s culture and diversity. We want to be open. We have a very flat organisation where anyone can exchange ideas. We have projects that people collaborate on in all continents – although possibly not Antarctica. People can come in at whatever time they want to the office, on any day, and wear what they want. But this freedom can only be used effectively if you set the right framework. This is called "OKRs" – Objectives and Key Results. If you come into the office for many hours, we clap, but if you only come in for a bit of time, we clap too, as long as your objectives are being met. What makes a great business leader? You can get much more from a person if you inspire them. We have this project, Project Loon, about releasing balloons really high, which move into the stratosphere and connect people all around the world through antennas. The aim of this project is to connect every person in the world – even in the middle of nowhere – because, in developing countries, technology changes lives. A good leader is also open and dedicated to every single person, regardless of their role in the organisation. Transparency is essential. Sometimes we have a piece of information that is confidential, but we try to share as much information as we can. Are there challenges related to working in the Arabian Gulf? When you have a homogenous population, it’s easier to predict how you can serve them better. Here, you have people from so many backgrounds – it’s challenging for us to understand how to serve them better. It’s not just about the search engine. When you watch a video on YouTube, what’s the next video we should suggest to you? What are you looking for? It’s easy to say "rose", but is it the colour, the flower, or Rose, the French singer, that you’re looking for? The second challenge specific to the Gulf is that you have great differences in wealth and access. There are people with many devices who are connected at the fastest possible speed, and people who are very sensitive to every megabyte or gigabyte, and have slow connectivity. Similarly, there’s one common language in the region, but a person in Oman will speak different Arabic to a Saudi. To make advertising relevant, we need to understand what consumers are looking for, which is challenging here. What is your favourite Google app? YouTube. I learn every day on YouTube. It’s easy to guess the second – the search engine. If one day we didn’t have this app any more, my life would stop. How does Google make money? We make about 90 per cent of our revenue from advertising. The second is technology around advertising and the third is the Cloud. The Cloud is a combination of storage, so being able to put content in servers on Google. It computes, which is processing power using very complex calculations. Instead of using different devices for these calculations, you just use the server and you pay for the amount that you use. We also have all these other applications like machine learning, which will be huge. In Google Translate, we use past translations and content created by others to improve. We’re talking about hundreds of millions of pieces of sentences that we use to improve our translation. How will Google be influencing the world 10 years from now? Go back to 2007, when I was joining Google, if you told me that the company would be mastering machine learning and beginning to work on life extension, I’m not sure I would’ve listened. Many of the things in this world that require manual labour are going to be reduced. Google participates actively in inventing the software that the machines of the future will run on. Google will also be busy analysing data to make decisions, developing augmented reality and making money from health care and driverless cars. Why is Google actually called Google? There’s this very long number called a "googol". The founders of the company thought this was very cool, but they changed it to Google. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More The Life Influencers know their followers best Transparent ‘Googliness’ helps make great business leaders Executive travel: Team bonding at the Tilal Liwa hotel in Abu Dhabi Day in the life: Multitasking entrepreneur and angel investor shares the joy MOST VIEWED Business | All GCC’s VAT framework takes shape Mall rent hikes may force retailers to go online Air Arabia profit hit by higher competition and capacity New chief executive for Arabtec Construction appointed Drake and Scull shareholders reject group’s capital-raising plan Aldar awards main contract for Yas Acres development to Trojan Executive travel: Team bonding at the Tilal Liwa hotel in Abu Dhabi Brent below $50?

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 32 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares177 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. Jay In my case, I created the account for my kid just to reserve the name so that by the time he's old enough he doesn't have to have [email protected] I also use it to write to him so he's got emails from me throughout his whole life that he can go back and read one day. Finally, though the email address is his name, it's *my* account until I choose to hand it over, therefore it's not violating any guidelines or terms since I'm over 13 and the other info on the account is mine. Rather than add "his" Google Account to my family account, what I'm hoping Google will do is allow me to transfer "my" other, existing Google account to him now under the family account. You're using semantics to make it seem like he's using an account he shouldn't have against the rules, and that's not the case in my situation. SBBH I've done the exact same thing and also wish Google would make this work with existing emails. Violet There's also the fact that in order for an Android phone to work, you have to have a Google account. So, if your kids get phones before they're thirteen, there's going to be some fudging of birth years during setup. SBBH Yep, not sure why they've waited so long to address this when for years now every kid has had a phone and because of that an email address. I know there are administrator and guest accounts or something like that (can't remember the exact names) in Android but I've found it often doesn't work as advertised or the older phones simply don't support it. I think the government also needs to update the laws a bit when it comes to this. IMHO AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

Unable to use my GSuite account for their Family Plan let alone Family Link. jj14x Gsuite - "A set of intelligent apps including Gmail, Docs, Drive and Calendar to connect the people in *your company*, no matter where in the world they are." Not saying it wouldn't be a good thing, but given that GSuite is designed to be a product for work, don't be surprised if it doesn't really materialize Alan Cramer My GSuite was obtained back when it was Google Apps for your Domain which one of the suggested uses was for families....over the years the focus has dropped off as they focus more and more on their pay for product. Infamous_Elsa It still needs app restrictions and website blocking like iOS Tired_Guy I have maybe an unusual situation but likely not and I did bring it to Google's attention but... My son is 25 but IDD and is like a big 5 year old. He does not yet have a legal guardian, but seriously, he will forever be a minor. I set him up a gmail account for his tablet and because many social services ask for one and it's nice to let him have one of his "own". The mail comes to me anyway. He gets music off the family plan google play and Red and we can keep his music and video choices separate from ours. Having an account means we can set him up on a new device pretty quickly at least as his favorite stuff goes. But a lot of what FL offers is stuff I'd love to be able to do in one place rather than doing it all ad hoc. Trust me, if I die, his mom isn't going to deal with the hows and whys of managing his account, access, email, browsing etc. And yes, app restrictions would be such a bonus as the existing stuff out there really sucks and I'm constantly getting the kid off the password screes and back to his video because he his something he shouldn't have. But beyond COPA and age 13, tere are a ton of parents like me with adult children who are disabled who'd love to be able to allow their kids internet access while managing it for them. John Stacy Please Google, let those of us who are using the Apps for Domains accounts, that were billed as great for families, be used for family sharing and family library. J.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Bill Perrotta What in the world are you are talking about? Supposedly this happened a day ago and I didn't even notice it. Everything is normal right now. Scofabear Is anyone having issues with Google now weather cards showing the wrong location? Amit_N Seriously.. on weekend? Why are Googlers working on weekends? Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

Among the throngs of students who mingled with employers amid balloons and multicolored gummy candies, the software engineers and those with a technology background were noticeably discriminating and in no rush to commit. That’s because in the tech market, workers are in greater demand than supply. “In the past four years, since Microsoft and Google set up their R&D centers in Israel, the competition for hiring students has become much stiffer,” said Yuval Beres, software development manager at Bloomberg LP in Israel, who was at Bloomberg’s stand with posters and handouts of how new employees can “Make Your Mark” at Bloomberg, a financial services company that uses software engineers in its R&D teams to help the company provide data for financial professionals globally. It has become “very hard” to get the best students, he said. “We have to really fight over them and the students are starting to be recruited much earlier than before,” Beres said. Many of the top picks either already have jobs or have received job offers. “We give them the best terms, but today we have to pay 70 percent more than we were offering in 2007,” he said. Bloomberg’s Yuval Beres at the IDC Job Fair in April 2017 (Courtesy: Ofer Amram) Students today are also much more discerning, Beres said. They don’t only want only to know about salaries, but also about potential progress in the job, possible career track, mentoring, and more, he said. Multinationals like Google and Microsoft are competing with Israeli tech companies and startups for the best of talent as a shortage of workers has become a major threat to Israel’s high-tech industry, which has been a key engine fueling its economy. The Finance Ministry warned last year that Israel’s high-tech sector has already ceased to be the nation’s growth engine as fewer students graduate with science degrees. The industry will lack more than 10,000 engineers and programmers in the coming decade if the government doesn’t take immediate action to prepare students to meet the shortfall, the Ministry of Economy and Industry’s former chief scientist Avi Hasson warned in a report last June. Students speak with prospective employers at IDC job fair in April 2017 (Courtesy Ofer Amram) This lack of a pool of skilled workers has been highlighted even more by the burst of activity in Israel’s high-tech sector, which has almost doubled the number of companies operating locally in the past decade. Many in the field want the challenge of starting their own company rather than joining an existing one, and successful entrepreneurs tend to return to the market with new ventures. The number of active high-tech companies operating in Israel has jumped from 3,781 in 2006 to 7,860 at the end for the first quarter of 2017, according to figures compiled by Tel Aviv based IVC Research Center, which tracks the industry. In addition, companies from Google to Apple, Deutsche Telecom and Bosch have all set up research and development centers in Israel, with 278 multinational companies operating a total of 357 R&D centers around the country today, compared with about 250 such centers in 2013, IVC data shows. Viola Hasbani an IDC student from Italy (Courtesy: Ofer Amram) “Competition is high,” confirmed Tali Peled, a business operations manager at Argus Cyber Security, which aims to provide cybersecurity solutions for connected vehicles. Peled was scouting for graduates in the fields of software development and cybersecurity, cloud engineers and big data. Argus attends many of the employment fairs across the country to identify students “we feel are relevant to us,” she said, including graduates of the army’s elite 8200 technology unit. “We hope this will help us build an effective and good database of CVs” for when the company is in need, she said. Some 112 companies attended the IDC fair, which was built around spheres: high-tech and internet; the financial sector, including banks and institutional investors; government offices, including the Mossad and the Shin Bet security services; consulting services; and miscellaneous industries, including consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola, Strauss and Fox, said Karin Kaufman, director of the career center at the IDC. Students and graduates of IDC and other universities walked around, some with CVs in hand, others sending theirs directly to potential employers via an app set up by IDC. Twenty-one-year-old Viola Hasbani from Italy, who is completing her third year of business studies at the IDC, was looking for a part-time job in marketing or business development. “Meeting people face-to-face is much more effective than just sending over your CV,” she said. LivePerson, a US tech firm that has an R&D center in Israel, develops products for online messaging, marketing and analytics. Yael On, its recruiting director, was scouting for data scientists, software developers, mobile developers and Java developers. “Attending the fair builds up our brand and exposes us as an employer to potential candidates while they are still students. The aim is to build a relationship with them. It increases the chances that when they look for work they will turn to us. It is a win-win for us and for the students,” she said. LivePerson’s Yael On scouts for software developers at IDC job fair in April 2017 (Courtesy Ofer Amram) “The market is flooded. There is a huge demand for workers but a very small supply of software developers. The salaries rise on a quarterly basis and the number of startups out there is affecting competition all the time. The salary benchmark data becomes irrelevant very quickly,” she said. On average, according to data compiled by Workey, which has developed a search job search engine for Israeli startups, in the five years to mid-2016 salaries for these skilled workers rose around 10 percent, and workers tended to change jobs on average every 20 months. The salary for an engineer in Israel is about $63,000, compared with a global average of $49,000, but still well below the $112,000 an engineer gets in Silicon Valley, according to the Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2017. Twenty-four-year-old Amir, who preferred not to disclose his last name, is in his second year of computer science studies at IDC, and is looking for part-time work in his field so he can “grow at the job,” he said. He feels he can be picky because he knows he is in a high-demand field. “I have good marks and I have some experience and I am confident,” he said, handing out his CV to a number of the firms present. Given the realities of the current high-tech job market, the odds are in his favor.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Companies After UK, Google agrees to pay Italy €306m in back taxes The amount is in addition to the taxes that Google has already paid in Italy. By Sarmistha Acharya May 7, 2017 13:10 BST Google agrees to pay €306m to ItalyReuters/Lucy Nicholson Google has agreed to pay €306m (£259m, $336m) to Italy to settle a tax dispute. Last year, Italy had accused Google of evading €227m in taxes between 2009 and 2013, which could attract hefty fines. The news about the settlement came after Rossella Orlandi, head of the Italian tax authority, recently said Google and Italy were close to a deal. "In addition to the taxes already paid in Italy during those years, Google will pay another €306m," a Google spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. Google and the Italian tax authority said the agreement covered the years between 2002 and 2015. The Italian tax office, in a separate statement on Thursday (4 May), said the amount of more than €306m pertained to both Google Italy and Google Ireland units. "With Google a process will be kicked off to come up with preventive agreements for correct taxation in Italy in the future for operations that regard our country," the tax office told Reuters. Such tax deals mark major victories for the countries that are chasing multinationals who have been avoiding corporation taxes. Google had previously said it complied with tax rules in every country it operates. Last January, Google agreed to pay £130m in back taxes to the British authorities. The opposition Labour Party and others claimed the amount was too little compared to the profit the company made in the country.

Home Apple News Apple Rumors iPhone iPad iPod Mac Apple TV Apple Watch About World Share on Facebook This is the elaborate phishing scam that is terrorizing the internet A new and elaborate technique of phishing via email is wreaking havoc on the internet these days using an email service provider as popular as Gmail. In fact, employees of several companies that employ Google for their work are suffering their consequences as well as other private clients of Gmail. Eye because this phishing could happen both on your computer, have the operating system you have, as on other devices from Apple or Android, as it affects your Google email account but could come from your iPhone or iPad from the browser or From your native email app manager or Google’s own. Do not miss how it works to be forewarned. How this Gmail phishing works It all starts with an email from a known contact where you’ll see that that person shares a Google document with you, that is, you can click on it to view, download, modify or add it to your Drive. So far all normal. Innocently, you click and then you’re redirected to a legitimate Google page where everything seems so secure that you have to re-enter your email and password to enter. As always, choose your account from the ones you have in your device and you proceed.   At that moment appears a page that looks original in which you will see an app called Google Docs asking for authorization to manage your emails. And you’ve already fallen into the trap because the Google Docs app is authorised to read, send and delete emails … but it is not from Google but is controlled by hackers. From this moment, many emails will be sent from your account to your contacts to extend the phishing. I imagine you can get the idea of the terror that causes hackers to have control of your account: personal and professional matters, passwords from other websites like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, access to your photos and files … Everything you have Communicated with Gmail is potentially endangered.   How to protect yourself from this phishing To protect you, today all you can do is delete any email that offers you a link to a Google Doc unless you can verify personally that the person who sent you the email has done so consciously. If you’ve already clicked on the link, you should turn on double-factor verification on as many sites as you can, so you have to use another device. Another additional step is to remove the permissions for this fake Google Docs app from your Google account. Go to the web myaccount.google.com, to the section Sign-In and Security > Connected Apps. From there, look at what apps have permission and delete those that are strange.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 5 easy ways to boost your happiness at work Let’s try a little experiment. Go to the Google search bar and type, “My job is” and see Google’s recommendations to complete the statement. My results: My job is. . . Killing me Boring (and so boring) Making me depressed Done here Killing my soul Telling, isn’t it? Although Americans spend more time at work than people in many other parts of the industrialized world, it seems we’re rather unhappy. Gallup says we have an employee engagement crisis, with 70 percent of Americans not engaged at work. Let’s say you have found your passion. You’re happy. Your job allows you to give back. You’re happy. You have perks such as ping-pong tables and happy hours. You’re happy. [RELATED: Learn how to engage employees through culture and communications at the Culture & Engagement for Communicators Conference.] Not so fast. Being happy takes intention and practice just like anything else (even with perks). Here are some key reasons we’re not happy, and some practical tips to turn that around: 1. You make too many decisions. When you tax your brain with too many decisions, you experience decision fatigue. You make better decisions when you have fewer to weigh. Tip to turn it around: Put some decisions on autopilot. Streamline your business attire (channel your inner Steve Jobs, perhaps), and organize your closet so you don’t have to dither about what to wear. Determine a set menu for lunches or dinners, so there is nothing to decide. Delegate decisions to your team that don’t require your input. 2. You’re not feeling productive. At day’s end, if you don’t feel you’ve been productive, you’ll question your self-worth. Tip to turn it around: Acknowledge your progress. Making to-do lists and crossing completed items gives you a visual and mental affirmation that you are accomplishing things. Discipline yourself to shun distractions such as checking your phone and email. 3. You feel you’re underpaid. When there is a perception of inequality in pay, it leads to employee unhappiness. This is historically the top reason employees are dissatisfied. Tip to turn it around: You have to ask for a pay raise, but try to have confidence. Payscale found that 75 percent of people who asked for a raise got one. Be prepared by knowing your worth and the accomplishments you have achieved. Even if your pay raise isn’t granted, you should walk out knowing what you’ll have to achieve to get one. 4. Expectations aren’t clear. When there is ambiguity about your role and responsibilities, it’s difficult to stay motivated and happy. Gallup found that only half of employees understand what is expected of them. Tip to turn it around: Confirm with your supervisor that the tasks listed on your job description are still accurate. In many cases, employees handle more than what’s on their job description. Update it if necessary to include all the tasks you do. Discuss your career goals and job growth with your supervisor, and always ask for feedback about your performance. 5. You feel out of control. It’s challenging to remain positive when you feel this way. Although some issues at work will always be beyond your direct authority or impact, you can take charge of other things. Tip to turn it around: Start and end your day in a positive way. Use your commute to listen to an uplifting podcast, savor your coffee away from your desk or perform a random act of kindness. At day’s end, acknowledge an achievement or something you are grateful for. These are ways you can control your day and start and end your workday on a high note. Because most of us spend more waking hours at work than we do at home, it’s important to do what you can to be happy in your workplace. What are things you do to boost your on-the-job happiness?

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 103 Plus 1 on G+ 370 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares578 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

I have not been disappointed! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c44fd1bc546c27c02f945b075e0388e076c62e0fd612b3c74442129a05446139.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c4618b9d22a1d44186f347c184038b3a833f38a1148cc4b91b95981303fa8b6b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/465d23a781688e73e20a0737904c3880ee693ee06b5dd1779ae91d9799b0488b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1f3d76182fdd59b34eda695d20943d03e71240b775f63106ef41809601a7cabf.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/66175dfb8d6503940dc945b8d865f4f8276c84f7f3abd0e0e46dc31136501275.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f7fa8ed860bc28a3a3e377a7e74591e764bdec5795747c4a1afb93eaa44aa0b2.jpg Rod You shouldn't. It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services.

Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page.

AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess.

Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

In the past two years, social media platforms rolled out a range of products designed to hook publishers. Snapchat Discover, Facebook Instant Articles, Apple News, Twitter Moments, and Google AMP all provide a space to publish content directly within platforms. Publishers, which have been losing advertising dollars to companies like Google and Facebook for years, are adopting these tools in the hopes of reaching more readers and pulling in revenue. Yet much of the social media action around news publishing, touted as earnest effort and welcomed by publishers, is just a boxing match between social giants vying for users and attention. Can publishers win in a fight that isn’t really about them? The most public displays of aggression are between Facebook and Snapchat. Snapchat rejected Facebook’s $3 billion offer to buy the platform in 2013, and has now captured millions of the youngest social users — in other words, the future. In January 2016, rumours began that Snapchat planned to encroach on Facebook’s ad model, with an API allowing it to target ads to users at a huge scale. Within weeks, Facebook opened its Audience Optimization tool to publishers, allowing them to target stories at specific readers. This wasn’t explicitly in response to Snapchat, but the targeting capability, and the data behind it, were two things Snapchat didn’t yet have. Facebook struck again in August, revealing a Snapchat clone on Instagram called Stories. Now, 200 million people use Stories daily, while Snapchat has a total of 158 million daily users. So obvious was this copycat move that Snapchat swiped, releasing a filter on April Fool’s that framed a user’s face as an Instagram post. Facebook doubled down during its developer conference F8, where founder Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook’s aim “to make the camera the first mainstream augmented reality platform.” In other words, putting graphics and filters over camera photos and videos, the entirety of Snapchat’s strategy. Stratechery founder and media analyst Ben Thompson wrote that F8 revealed a Facebook that “shamelessly” embraced “the audacity of copying well.” ALSO READ: Facebook denies targeting insecure users Facebook isn’t only fighting Snapchat. In the ad space, its rival is Google. In February 2016, Google launched Accelerated Mobile Pages – a wordy name for a product similar to Facebook’s Instant Articles. Both offered fast-loading mobile pages to publishers willing to let the platforms host the content, and the clicks. The difference is that Facebook is more restrictive with the number and format of ads, while on AMP publishers can have as many ads as they want. As social media platforms find more ways to host content in their own walled gardens, this could be interpreted as a plea by Google to keep journalism on their turf: the open web. “Facebook passed Google as the top traffic driver back in 2015,” Thompson noted, “and as of last fall drove over 40 percent of traffic for the average news site.” Now, Google is creeping up; major US publishers get 7 percent of their traffic from AMP. Platforms are also competing over video. Last year, Facebook doubled down on live video, prioritising it in the News Feed and giving certain publishers a total of $50 million to create videos with their Live product. About a month later, Twitter signed a coveted NFL live streaming deal, one of many live video deals it would secure throughout the year, including with Bloomberg and Cheddar. Twitter’s lead didn’t last long: Amazon outbid Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube for this year’s NFL contract. Where does all of that leave publishers? Spending resources on this expanding arena and hoping the returns on investment outweigh the costs. Our interviews with more than 70 social media managers and strategists for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism’s “The Platform Press: How Silicon Valley Reengineered Journalism” found that expensive news distribution strategies aren’t yet yielding enough consistent revenue for publishers to justify the costs or to know whether their strategies are working. Some publishers feel they simply cannot opt out. According to Digital Content Next, publishers’ native strategies were yielding an average of $7.7 million each — disappointing, but not negligible — only two years in. Still, one head of social distribution from a broadcast news organisation, which are particularly affected by the platform emphasis on video, said in an interview, “We would have a real detrimental effect to our business overall if we were not playing on all these different platforms.” Many publishers noted the complexities of “how to optimise for competing platforms when what optimises to one platform goes against what would optimise for another one.” If two different platforms permit or optimise for different video lengths, two versions must be created. Also, translating user data provided from platform to platform is not “apples to apples.” And it is resource intensive to populate every platform with high-performing content; not every newsroom can afford to staff around platform products, so they have to move around the pieces they already have, which are often already spread thin. David Skok, a digital media executive who has worked for, among others, the Boston Globe and Toronto Star, told us, “I feel as if we are collateral damage in the war between these platforms. They’ll give some publishers a chance to play, but not others. They’ll give favourable rates and treatments to some and not to others. They are already picking winners.” Such preferential treatment includes the roughly two dozen coveted Snapchat Discover deals, or the Facebook Live subsidies for a select group of publishers. Some publishers may be able to leverage exclusive content in order to keep up with platforms’ shifting priorities as platforms compete for users. Organisations such as BuzzFeed, for example, or Time, Inc., which owns high-value brands like Sports Illustrated, Food + Wine, and Entertainment Weekly. ALSO READ: Facebook adding 3,000 people to screen out violent content Regina Buckley, senior vice president of Digital Business Development and Business Operations at Time Inc., sees platform competition as a good thing. “Over the past year or so, we have seen the various distribution platforms begin to compete for exclusive access to specific pieces of our content. This is a good thing for us because scarcity creates value, and value creates leverage for us as content creators,” she said. And leverage often means dollars. For publishers with a budget only for text and a small readership, the future looks grim. The platforms’ focus on exclusive and premium content is unlikely to change anytime soon. Facebook is laying the groundwork on the advertising side: The company in November began moving toward fewer ads on its platform, which is likely to drive up the price, and quality, of each ad. While large publishers are able to produce premium content against which they can place high-value ads, small publishers don’t have such capability. As long as platforms are chasing users, it is inevitable that some publishers, as Skok put it, will be “collateral damage.” -- Columbia Journalism Review The writer is a research fellow on the Platforms and Publishers project at Columbia Journalism School’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism.

As Britain heads to the polls again, is our electoral process still fit for purpose? by Carole Cadwalladr The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked Sunday 7 May 2017 04.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close “The connectivity that is the heart of globalisation can be exploited by states with hostile intent to further their aims.[…] The risks at stake are profound and represent a fundamental threat to our sovereignty.” Alex Younger, head of MI6, December, 2016 “It’s not MI6’s job to warn of internal threats. It was a very strange speech. Was it one branch of the intelligence services sending a shot across the bows of another? Or was it pointed at Theresa May’s government? Does she know something she’s not telling us?” Senior intelligence analyst, April 2017 In June 2013, a young American postgraduate called Sophie was passing through London when she called up the boss of a firm where she’d previously interned. The company, SCL Elections, went on to be bought by Robert Mercer, a secretive hedge fund billionaire, renamed Cambridge Analytica, and achieved a certain notoriety as the data analytics firm that played a role in both Trump and Brexit campaigns. But all of this was still to come. London in 2013 was still basking in the afterglow of the Olympics. Britain had not yet Brexited. The world had not yet turned. “That was before we became this dark, dystopian data company that gave the world Trump,” a former Cambridge Analytica employee who I’ll call Paul tells me. “It was back when we were still just a psychological warfare firm.” Was that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? “Totally. That’s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations – the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It’s what they mean by winning ‘hearts and minds’. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don’t have many rules.” Why would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. “It was like working for MI6. Only it’s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It’s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.” On that day in June 2013, Sophie met up with SCL’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and gave him the germ of an idea. “She said, ‘You really need to get into data.’ She really drummed it home to Alexander. And she suggested he meet this firm that belonged to someone she knew about through her father.” Who’s her father? “Eric Schmidt.” Eric Schmidt – the chairman of Google? “Yes. And she suggested Alexander should meet this company called Palantir.” I had been speaking to former employees of Cambridge Analytica for months and heard dozens of hair-raising stories, but it was still a gobsmacking moment. To anyone concerned about surveillance, Palantir is practically now a trigger word. The data-mining firm has contracts with governments all over the world – including GCHQ and the NSA. It’s owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of eBay and PayPal, who became Silicon Valley’s first vocal supporter of Trump. In some ways, Eric Schmidt’s daughter showing up to make an introduction to Palantir is just another weird detail in the weirdest story I have ever researched. A weird but telling detail. Because it goes to the heart of why the story of Cambridge Analytica is one of the most profoundly unsettling of our time. Sophie Schmidt now works for another Silicon Valley megafirm: Uber. And what’s clear is that the power and dominance of the Silicon Valley – Google and Facebook and a small handful of others – are at the centre of the global tectonic shift we are currently witnessing. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The money man: Robert Mercer, Trump supporter and owner of Cambridge Analytica. Photograph: Rex It also reveals a critical and gaping hole in the political debate in Britain. Because what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration’s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play; it also reveals the elephant in the room as we hurtle into a general election: Britain tying its future to an America that is being remade - in a radical and alarming way - by Trump. There are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future. My entry point into this story began, as so many things do, with a late-night Google. Last December, I took an unsettling tumble into a wormhole of Google autocomplete suggestions that ended with “did the holocaust happen”. And an entire page of results that claimed it didn’t. Google’s algorithm had been gamed by extremist sites and it was Jonathan Albright, a professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, who helped me get to grips with what I was seeing. He was the first person to map and uncover an entire “alt-right” news and information ecosystem and he was the one who first introduced me to Cambridge Analytica. He called the company a central point in the right’s “propaganda machine”, a line I quoted in reference to its work for the Trump election campaign and the referendum Leave campaign. That led to the second article featuring Cambridge Analytica – as a central node in the alternative news and information network that I believed Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon, the key Trump aide who is now his chief strategist, were creating. I found evidence suggesting they were on a strategic mission to smash the mainstream media and replace it with one comprising alternative facts, fake history and rightwing propaganda. Mercer is a brilliant computer scientist, a pioneer in early artificial intelligence, and the co-owner of one of the most successful hedge funds on the planet (with a gravity-defying 71.8% annual return). And, he is also, I discovered, good friends with Nigel Farage. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s communications director, told me that it was Mercer who had directed his company, Cambridge Analytica, to “help” the Leave campaign. The second article triggered two investigations, which are both continuing: one by the Information Commissioner’s Office into the possible illegal use of data. And a second by the Electoral Commission which is “focused on whether one or more donations – including services – accepted by Leave.EU was ‘impermissable’”. What I then discovered is that Mercer’s role in the referendum went far beyond this. Far beyond the jurisdiction of any UK law. The key to understanding how a motivated and determined billionaire could bypass ourelectoral laws rests on AggregateIQ, an obscure web analytics company based in an office above a shop in Victoria, British Columbia. It was with AggregateIQ that Vote Leave (the official Leave campaign) chose to spend £3.9m, more than half its official £7m campaign budget. As did three other affiliated Leave campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party, spending a further £757,750. “Coordination” between campaigns is prohibited under UK electoral law, unless campaign expenditure is declared, jointly. It wasn’t. Vote Leave says the Electoral Commission “looked into this” and gave it “a clean bill of health”. How did an obscure Canadian company come to play such a pivotal role in Brexit? It’s a question that Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of communication, media and power at King’s College London has been asking too. “I went through all the Leave campaign invoices when the Electoral Commission uploaded them to its site in February. And I kept on discovering all these huge amounts going to a company that not only had I never heard of, but that there was practically nothing at all about on the internet. More money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. All I found, at that time, was a one-page website and that was it. It was an absolute mystery.” Moore contributed to an LSE report published in April that concluded UK’s electoral laws were “weak and helpless” in the face of new forms of digital campaigning. Offshore companies, money poured into databases, unfettered third parties… the caps on spending had come off. The laws that had always underpinned Britain’s electoral laws were no longer fit for purpose. Laws, the report said, that needed “urgently reviewing by parliament”. AggregateIQ holds the key to unravelling another complicated network of influence that Mercer has created. A source emailed me to say he had found that AggregateIQ’s address and telephone number corresponded to a company listed on Cambridge Analytica’s website as its overseas office: “SCL Canada”. A day later, that online reference vanished. There had to be a connection between the two companies. Between the various Leave campaigns. Between the referendum and Mercer. It was too big a coincidence. But everyone – AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica, Leave.EU, Vote Leave – denied it. AggregateIQ had just been a short-term “contractor” to Cambridge Analytica. There was nothing to disprove this. We published the known facts. On 29 March, article 50 was triggered. Then I meet Paul, the first of two sources formerly employed by Cambridge Analytica. He is in his late 20s and bears mental scars from his time there. “It’s almost like post-traumatic shock. It was so… messed up. It happened so fast. I just woke up one morning and found we’d turned into the Republican fascist party. I still can’t get my head around it.” He laughed when I told him the frustrating mystery that was AggregateIQ. “Find Chris Wylie,” he said. Who’s Chris Wylie? “He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica. And he’s from west Canada. It’s only because of him that AggregateIQ exist. They’re his friends. He’s the one who brought them in.” There wasn’t just a relationship between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, Paul told me. They were intimately entwined, key nodes in Robert Mercer’s distributed empire. “The Canadians were our back office. They built our software for us. They held our database. If AggregateIQ is involved then Cambridge Analytica is involved. And if Cambridge Analytica is involved, then Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon are involved. You need to find Chris Wylie.” Mark Zuckerberg says change the world, yet he sets the rules | Carole Cadwalladr Read more I did find Chris Wylie. He refused to comment. Key to understanding how data would transform the company is knowing where it came from. And it’s a letter from “Director of Defence Operations, SCL Group”, that helped me realise this. It’s from “Commander Steve Tatham, PhD, MPhil, Royal Navy (rtd)” complaining about my use in my Mercer article of the word “disinformation”. I wrote back to him pointing out references in papers he’d written to “deception” and “propaganda”, which I said I understood to be “roughly synonymous with ‘disinformation’.” It’s only later that it strikes me how strange it is that I’m corresponding with a retired navy commander about military strategies that may have been used in British and US elections. What’s been lost in the US coverage of this “data analytics” firm is the understanding of where the firm came from: deep within the military-industrial complex. A weird British corner of it populated, as the military establishment in Britain is, by old-school Tories. Geoffrey Pattie, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement and director of Marconi Defence Systems, used to be on the board, and Lord Marland, David Cameron’s pro-Brexit former trade envoy, a shareholder. Steve Tatham was the head of psychological operations for British forces in Afghanistan. The Observer has seen letters endorsing him from the UK Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and Nato. SCL/Cambridge Analytica was not some startup created by a couple of guys with a Mac PowerBook. It’s effectively part of the British defence establishment. And, now, too, the American defence establishment. An ex-commanding officer of the US Marine Corps operations centre, Chris Naler, has recently joined Iota Global, a partner of the SCL group. This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.” Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Bannon, former vice-president of Cambridge Analytica, now a key adviser to Donald Trump. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters And it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people’s Facebook “likes”. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends – a process then allowed by the social network. Facebook was the source of the psychological insights that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target individuals. It was also the mechanism that enabled them to be delivered on a large scale. The company also (perfectly legally) bought consumer datasets – on everything from magazine subscriptions to airline travel – and uniquely it appended these with the psych data to voter files. It matched all this information to people’s addresses, their phone numbers and often their email addresses. “The goal is to capture every single aspect of every voter’s information environment,” said David. “And the personality data enabled Cambridge Analytica to craft individual messages.” Finding “persuadable” voters is key for any campaign and with its treasure trove of data, Cambridge Analytica could target people high in neuroticism, for example, with images of immigrants “swamping” the country. The key is finding emotional triggers for each individual voter. Cambridge Analytica worked on campaigns in several key states for a Republican political action committee. Its key objective, according to a memo the Observer has seen, was “voter disengagement” and “to persuade Democrat voters to stay at home”: a profoundly disquieting tactic. It has previously been claimed that suppression tactics were used in the campaign, but this document provides the first actual evidence. But does it actually work? One of the criticisms that has been levelled at my and others’ articles is that Cambridge Analytica’s “special sauce” has been oversold. Is what it is doing any different from any other political consultancy? “It’s not a political consultancy,” says David. “You have to understand this is not a normal company in any way. I don’t think Mercer even cares if it ever makes any money. It’s the product of a billionaire spending huge amounts of money to build his own experimental science lab, to test what works, to find tiny slivers of influence that can tip an election. Robert Mercer did not invest in this firm until it ran a bunch of pilots – controlled trials. This is one of the smartest computer scientists in the world. He is not going to splash $15m on bullshit.” Tamsin Shaw, an associate professor of philosophy at New York University, helps me understand the context. She has researched the US military’s funding and use of psychological research for use in torture. “The capacity for this science to be used to manipulate emotions is very well established. This is military-funded technology that has been harnessed by a global plutocracy and is being used to sway elections in ways that people can’t even see, don’t even realise is happening to them,” she says. “It’s about exploiting existing phenomenon like nationalism and then using it to manipulate people at the margins. To have so much data in the hands of a bunch of international plutocrats to do with it what they will is absolutely chilling. “We are in an information war and billionaires are buying up these companies, which are then employed to go to work in the heart of government. That’s a very worrying situation.” Google is not ‘just’ a platform. It frames, shapes and distorts how we see the world Read more A project that Cambridge Analytica carried out in Trinidad in 2013 brings all the elements in this story together. Just as Robert Mercer began his negotiations with SCL boss Alexander Nix about an acquisition, SCL was retained by several government ministers in Trinidad and Tobago. The brief involved developing a micro-targeting programme for the governing party of the time. And AggregateIQ – the same company involved in delivering Brexit for Vote Leave – was brought in to build the targeting platform. David said: “The standard SCL/CA method is that you get a government contract from the ruling party. And this pays for the political work. So, it’s often some bullshit health project that’s just a cover for getting the minister re-elected. But in this case, our government contacts were with Trinidad’s national security council.” The security work was to be the prize for the political work. Documents seen by the Observer show that this was a proposal to capture citizens’ browsing history en masse, recording phone conversations and applying natural language processing to the recorded voice data to construct a national police database, complete with scores for each citizen on their propensity to commit crime. “The plan put to the minister was Minority Report. It was pre-crime. And the fact that Cambridge Analytica is now working inside the Pentagon is, I think, absolutely terrifying,” said David. These documents throw light on a significant and under-reported aspect of the Trump administration. The company that helped Trump achieve power in the first place has now been awarded contracts in the Pentagon and the US state department. Its former vice-president Steve Bannon now sits in the White House. It is also reported to be in discussions for “military and homeland security work”. In the US, the government is bound by strict laws about what data it can collect on individuals. But, for private companies anything goes. Is it unreasonable to see in this the possible beginnings of an authoritarian surveillance state? A state that is bringing corporate interests into the heart of the administration. Documents detail Cambridge Analytica is involved with many other right-leaning billionaires, including Rupert Murdoch. One memo references Cambridge Analytica trying to place an article with a journalist in Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal: “RM re-channeled and connected with Jamie McCauley from Robert Thomson News Corp office,” it says. It makes me think again about the story involving Sophie Schmidt, Cambridge Analytica and Palantir. Is it a telling detail, or is it a clue to something else going on? Cambridge Analytica and Palantir both declined to comment for this article on whether they had any relationship. But witnesses and emails confirm that meetings between Cambridge Analytica and Palantir took place in 2013. The possibility of a working relationship was at least discussed. Further documents seen by the Observer confirm that at least one senior Palantir employee consulted with Cambridge Analytica in relation to the Trinidad project and later political work in the US. But at the time, I’m told, Palantir decided it was too much of a reputational risk for a more formal arrangement. There was no upside to it. Palantir is a company that is trusted to handle vast datasets on UK and US citizens for GCHQ and the NSA, as well as many other countries. Now though, they are both owned by ideologically aligned billionaires: Robert Mercer and Peter Thiel. The Trump campaign has said that Thiel helped it with data. A campaign that was led by Steve Bannon, who was then at Cambridge Analytica. A leading QC who spends a lot of time in the investigatory powers tribunal said that the problem with this technology was that it all depended on whose hands it was in. “On the one hand, it’s being done by companies and governments who say ‘you can trust us, we are good and democratic and bake cakes at the weekend’. But then the same expertise can also be sold on to whichever repressive regime.” In Britain, we still trust our government. We respect our authorities to uphold our laws. We trust the rule of law. We believe we live in a free and fair democracy. Which is what, I believe, makes the last part of this story so profoundly unsettling. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump with Peter Thiel, one of his key Silicon Valley supporters. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images The details of the Trinidad project finally unlocked the mystery that was AggregateIQ. Trinidad was SCL’s first project using big data for micro-targeting before the firm was acquired by Mercer. It was the model that Mercer was buying into. And it brought together all the players: the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, AggregateIQ, Chris Wylie, and two other individuals who would play a role in this story: Mark Gettleson, a focus group expert who had previously worked for the Lib Dems. And Thomas Borwick, the son of Victoria Borwick, the Conservative MP for Kensington. When my article linking Mercer and Leave.EU was published in February, no one was more upset about it than former Tory adviser Dominic Cummings, the campaign strategist for Vote Leave. He launched an irate Twitter tirade. The piece was “full of errors & itself spreads disinformation” “CA had ~0% role in Brexit referendum”. A week later the Observer revealed AggregateIQ’s possible link to Cambridge Analytica. Cummings’s Twitter feed went quiet. He didn’t return my messages or my emails. Questions had already been swirling about whether there had been any coordination between the Leave campaigns. In the week before the referendum, Vote Leave donated money to two other Leave groups – £625,000 to BeLeave, run by fashion student Darren Grimes, and £100,000 to Veterans for Britain, who both then spent this money with AggregateIQ. The Electoral Commission has written to AggregateIQ. A source close to the investigation said that AggregateIQ responded by saying it had signed a non-disclosure agreement. And since it was outside British jurisdiction, that was the end of it. Vote Leave refers to this as the Electoral Commission giving it “a clean bill of health”. On his blog, Dominic Cummings has written thousands of words about the referendum campaign. What is missing is any details about his data scientists. He “hired physicists” is all he’ll say. In the books on Brexit, other members of the team talk about “Dom’s astrophysicists”, who he kept “a tightly guarded secret”. They built models, using data “scraped” off Facebook. Finally, after weeks of messages, he sent me an email. We were agreed on one thing, it turned out. He wrote: “The law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising.” But, he says, “by encouraging people to focus on non-stories like Mercer’s nonexistent role in the referendum you are obscuring these important issues”. And to finally answer the question about how Vote Leave found this obscure Canadian company on the other side of the planet, he wrote: “Someone found AIQ [AggregateIQ] on the internet and interviewed them on the phone then told me – let’s go with these guys. They were clearly more competent than any others we’d spoken to in London.” The most unfortunate aspect of this – for Dominic Cummings – is that this isn’t credible. It’s the work of moments to put a date filter on Google search and discover that in late 2015 or early 2016, there are no Google hits for “Aggregate IQ”. There is no press coverage. No random mentions. It doesn’t even throw up its website. I have caught Dominic Cummings in what appears to be an alternative fact. But what is an actual fact is that Gettleson and Borwick, both previously consultants for SCL and Cambridge Analytica, were both core members of the Vote Leave team. They’re both in the official Vote Leave documents lodged with the Electoral Commission, though they coyly describe their previous work for SCL/Cambridge Analytica as “micro-targeting in Antigua and Trinidad” and “direct communications for several PACs, Senate and Governor campaigns”. And Borwick wasn’t just any member of the team. He was Vote Leave’s chief technology officer. This story may involve a complex web of connections, but it all comes back to Cambridge Analytica. It all comes back to Mercer. Because the connections must have been evident. “AggregateIQ may not have belonged to the Mercers but they exist within his world,” David told me. “Almost all of their contracts came from Cambridge Analytica or Mercer. They wouldn’t exist without them. During the whole time the referendum was going on, they were working every day on the [Ted] Cruz campaign with Mercer and Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ built and ran Cambridge Analytica’s database platforms.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: James Melaugh Cummings won’t say who did his modelling. But invoices lodged with the Electoral Commission show payments to a company called Advanced Skills Institute. It takes me weeks to spot the significance of this because the company is usually referred to as ASI Data Science, a company that has a revolving cast of data scientists who have gone on to work with Cambridge Analytica and vice versa. There are videos of ASI data scientists presenting Cambridge Analytica personality models and pages for events the two companies have jointly hosted. ASI told the Observer it had no formal relationship with Cambridge Analytica. Here’s the crucial fact: during the US primary elections, Aggregate IQ signed away its intellectual property (IP). It didn’t own its IP: Robert Mercer did. For AggregateIQ to work with another campaign in Britain, the firm would have to have had the express permission of Mercer. Asked if it would make any comment on financial or business links between “Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, AggregateIQ, Leave.EU and Vote Leave”, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said: “Cambridge Analytica did no paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU.” This story isn’t about cunning Dominic Cummings finding a few loopholes in the Electoral Commission’s rules. Finding a way to spend an extra million quid here. Or (as the Observer has also discovered )underdeclaring the costs of his physicists on the spending returns by £43,000. This story is not even about what appears to be covert coordination between Vote Leave and Leave.EU in their use of AggregateIQ and Cambridge Analytica. It’s about how a motivated US billionaire – Mercer and his chief ideologue, Bannon – helped to bring about the biggest constitutional change to Britain in a century. Because to understand where and how Brexit is connected to Trump, it’s right here. These relationships, which thread through the middle of Cambridge Analytica, are the result of a transatlantic partnership that stretches back years. Nigel Farage and Bannon have been close associates since at least 2012. Bannon opened the London arm of his news website Breitbart in 2014 to support Ukip – the latest front “in our current cultural and political war”, he told the New York Times. Britain had always been key to Bannon’s plans, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee told me on condition of anonymity. It was a crucial part of his strategy for changing the entire world order. “He believes that to change politics, you have to first change the culture. And Britain was key to that. He thought that where Britain led, America would follow. The idea of Brexit was hugely symbolically important to him.” On 29 March, the day article 50 was triggered, I called one of the smaller campaigns, Veterans for Britain. Cummings’s strategy was to target people in the last days of the campaign and Vote Leave gave the smaller group £100,000 in the last week. A small number of people they identified as “persuadable” were bombarded with more than a billion ads, the vast majority in the last few days. I asked David Banks, Veterans for Britain’s head of communications, why they spent the money with AggregateIQ. “I didn’t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us. There’s no conspiracy here. They were this Canadian company which was opening an office in London to work in British politics and they were doing stuff that none of the UK companies could offer. Their targeting was based on a set of technologies that hadn’t reached the UK yet. A lot of it was proprietary, they’d found a way of targeting people based on behavioural insights. They approached us.” It seems clear to me that David Banks didn’t know there might have been anything untoward about this. He’s a patriotic man who believes in British sovereignty and British values and British laws. I don’t think knew about any overlap with these other campaigns. I can only think that he was played. And that we, the British people, were played. In his blog, Dominic Cummings writes that Brexit came down to “about 600,000 people – just over 1% of registered voters”. It’s not a stretch to believe that a member of the global 1% found a way to influence this crucial 1% of British voters. The referendum was an open goal too tempting a target for US billionaires not to take a clear shot at. Or I should say US billionaires and other interested parties, because in acknowledging the transatlantic links that bind Britain and America, Brexit and Trump, so tightly, we also must acknowledge that Russia is wrapped somewhere in this tight embrace too. For the last month, I’ve been writing about the links between the British right, the Trump administration and the European right. And these links lead to Russia from multiple directions. Between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica. A map shown to the Observer showing the many places in the world where SCL and Cambridge Analytica have worked includes Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Iran and Moldova. Multiple Cambridge Analytica sources have revealed other links to Russia, including trips to the country, meetings with executives from Russian state-owned companies, and references by SCL employees to working for Russian entities. What Brexit should have taught us about voter manipulation | Paul Flynn Read more Article 50 has been triggered. AggregateIQ is outside British jurisdiction. The Electoral Commission is powerless. And another election, with these same rules, is just a month away. It is not that the authorities don’t know there is cause for concern. The Observer has learned that the Crown Prosecution Service did appoint a special prosecutor to assess whether there was a case for a criminal investigation into whether campaign finance laws were broken. The CPS referred it back to the electoral commission. Someone close to the intelligence select committee tells me that “work is being done” on potential Russian interference in the referendum. Gavin Millar, a QC and expert in electoral law, described the situation as “highly disturbing”. He believes the only way to find the truth would be to hold a public inquiry. But a government would need to call it. A government that has just triggered an election specifically to shore up its power base. An election designed to set us into permanent alignment with Trump’s America. Martin Moore of King’s College, London, pointed out that elections were a newly fashionable tool for would-be authoritarian states. “Look at Erdoğan in Turkey. What Theresa May is doing is quite anti-democratic in a way. It’s about enhancing her power very deliberately. It’s not about a battle of policy between two parties.” This is Britain in 2017. A Britain that increasingly looks like a “managed” democracy. Paid for a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us. If we let this referendum result stand, we are giving it our implicit consent. This isn’t about Remain or Leave. It goes far beyond party politics. It’s about the first step into a brave, new, increasingly undemocratic world.

Google kills Android Nougat beta – Android Oreo incoming? by Sean Keach 23 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments The next major version of Android is nearly here, as Google shuts down the Android Nougat beta for good. There will be no more beta-tested versions of Android Nougat software, as Google has finally killed off the beta program. Instead, we’re now hanging around for the full launch of Google’s Android O, following the release of the Developer Preview on March 21. Developers subscribed to the new Developer Preview are currently in ‘Preview 1’, which is basically an alpha phase. We’re not expecting to see a beta until the official Android O launch, which is likely to take place on May 17 during Google’s annual I/O developer conference. At the show, it’s likely Google will announce full details of major changes incoming with Android O. We’ll also probably learn the official name for the software; Google has a tradition of naming Android versions after delicious treats. A clear frontrunner for Android O’s name is ‘Oreo’, but we could see a surprise winner – oatmeal cookie, perhaps? Android Nougat is the seventh major version of Google’s Android OS, and was first released in alpha back on March 9, 2016. The full consumer release came much later, in August that year, rolling out first to Google’s own Nexus devices. As of May 2017, estimates put 7.1% of all Android devices as running on Nougat, based on Google Play traffic data. Just 0.5% of those are on the latest Android 7.1 version however, with the remaining 6.6% still using Android 7.0.

Our smartphones and tablets are very secure these days especially with the rise of fingerprint scanners. As a result, passwords or pin codes aren’t used as often. If you forgot yours we may be able to help. At the same time, fingerprint scanners mean we use our password or pin less than before. And as a result some may forget it. Don’t worry though, your phone isn’t useless if you forget your password or pin. We can reset it, bypass the code, or wipe the device and get back in. Read: How to Find a Lost or Stolen Android Smartphone or Tablet Over the years Google has continued to improve the security of our Android devices. In 2017 resetting a password or pin isn’t as easy as it used to be. However, there are tools available. Especially for owners who are proactive and take a few important steps ahead of time. We’ll cover that and more below. First things first, use tools like the Android Device Manager by Google or Find My Mobile from Samsung. These are crucial in terms of saving a smartphone that is lost, stolen, or you forget a password. Both have multiple features that can be a life-saver. How to Reset Your Android Password or Pin As long as you remember your Google account’s username and password, you have options. Almost every Android device uses a Google account, for the best experience, meaning nearly all users should have one linked to their device. This is the most important step. Reset Password or Pin with Android 4.4 and Below The easiest way to fix things if you forget your Android password, pin, or pattern is for those using Android 4.4 KitKat or older. However, most devices are running a more modern version than KitKat, so this only applies to select few users. If your device runs Android 4.4 KitKat or older the system has a tool built-in to reset a password. Sadly, Google removed this feature in Android 5.0 Lollipop and newer. In order to find this built-in feature simply enter the wrong password or PIN five times on the lockscreen. The device will say you’ve entered it wrong too many times, and offer up a reset. Users can look for a button that says“Forgot pattern,” “forgot PIN,” or “forgot password” under the login area. As shown in our photo above. From here simply enter your Google account information and password, follow the instructions and change your device password, pin or pattern. Android 5.0 Lollipop and Newer Everyone using Android 5.0 Lollipop or newer, which should be most, don’t have the same luxury as above. Almost all recent devices are running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat these days. Don’t worry though, we still have some potential solutions for you. First up is Samsung Galaxy or Note and tablet owners. Since Samsung’s the most popular manufacturer, millions of people own their devices. As long as you have a Samsung account, simply go to their helpful Find My Mobile website and login. This works similar to Apple’s Find My iPhone. Use Samsung Find My Mobile to reset a pin Once you sign in to your Samsung account and select which device you’re looking for, the options will be presented on the right side of the screen. Now just use the “Unlock my screen” option to remove your device’s lock screen password remotely. Alternatively, Samsung has options to make it ring if lost, lock (or relock and choose a security measure) to prevent theft. And finally there’s a choice to remotely erase everything. Hit the middle option highlighted above, to lock your Samsung device. Owners will have the option to choose a new password, pattern or pin method. Other popular manufacturers may have a similar features and tracking sites for their devices. Android Device Manager As an alternative for those who don’t have a Samsung account or are using another device, Google offers a similar feature for any and all Android users. It’s called the Android Device Manager. Simply visit the Android Device Manager website, login to your gmail account, and follow similar steps to the Samsung method above. Add a new lockscreen password using ADM Google’s system will replace the current lockscreen with a password lock. Additionally owners can add a recovery message or number in case the device is lost. However, it appears that if you have a current lockscreen PIN, the Android Device Manager won’t actually replace it with a password. You can however, head into the Android Device Manager and hit “Erase” to completely erase a device. This will delete everything off of your phone, including a password or pin. You’ll be able to setup the phone like it’s new, following the “erase” which isn’t the best scenario. Furthermore, most of your device is backed up by Google and can quickly and easily be restored. Factory Data Reset Method If none of the options above worked for you, there is one more step. This is similar to hitting erase in the Android Device Manager, or wiping your device on Samsung Find My Mobile. Owners can boot their smartphone or tablet into recovery mode, and perform a factory data reset. This will erase everything, including any password or pin lock. As we said above, most modern devices sync to the cloud and backup most of your important information. Like apps, text messages or photos. So resetting the device and starting from scratch isn’t as bad as it sounds. Just a little time-consuming. The easiest way to perform a factory reset is with the Android Device Manager. If that isn’t installed, boot into recovery or safe mode and select it from the menu. To reboot into recovery one must turn off the phone, then reboot while holding a series of buttons at the same time. It differs by device, and a quick Google search to boot into recovery mode is the best way to find out how. For example, Samsung Galaxy phones need to be turned off. Then press and hold volume up, power, and the home button simultaneously. Hold until you see blue text that says “rebooting recovery…” at the top. From here use the volume keys to scroll down to “Factory Reset” and reset your device. Most devices have a similar method for booting into recovery, and Google has a big list of them right here. Other Methods As we said earlier, each manufacturer may have other methods available for owners. Check your to find out more information. At the end of the day it’s a good idea to have this information ahead of time, and install the ADM on any device you own. Users can also temporarily get around this problem by using “Smart Lock” which debuted on Android 5.0 Lollipop. By using trusted places, devices, or connections, the operating system bypasses any lockscreen method. If setup you won’t need the password or pin while at a trusted place like home or work, or connected to accessories. It’s a last resort, but one more way for owners to potentially access their device if they forget their password. At least long enough to backup their phone before doing a full factory reset. In closing, everyone needs to know that our devices are more secure than ever before. Privacy and security are a top priority at Google, which is why forgetting a password or pin can be such a challenge to overcome. Give any of the steps above a try, and good luck.

After several years of service, the Google Play Top Developer program is being put to rest Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 3:20pm PDTMay 5, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 41 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares121 Google News The Top Developers program launched several years ago as a method of drawing attention to devs who put out great apps. We all started seeing the little blue arrow badge next to some of the developers' names, but it got easy to grow accustomed and eventually jaded to it.  The time has come, it seems, to say goodbye to the program. Google has sent out an email to some developers discussing the eclipse of the Top Developers badge and system, but there's also a promise of something new on the horizon. The Play Store's app recognition methodology will soon have more of a focus on individual apps and games that are worth noting, instead of an entire dev account. Here's the email: "The Google Play Top Developer program was created to recognize partners who developed top quality Android apps and games Every day developers like you are hard at work creating apps and games on Android. Whether you’re updating an existing app or building something new, we’ve seen an incredible increase in the level of polish and quality in so many fun, entertaining, and useful apps. We want to make sure more people find the great experiences you are creating. The Google Play Top Developer program launched many years ago to recognize developers who created high quality Android apps and games. We conducted research, with both developers and consumers, and observed a clear value and preference for the recognition of individual apps and games, instead of entire organizations. After taking a look at our existing app recognition programs, the Google Play editorial team has decided to focus its efforts on recognizing high quality and innovative apps and games. As a first step, we will be closing the Top Developer program and removing the badging from the Play Store within 30 days. We have exciting plans to recognize more of the great apps and games you create and will be sharing updates soon. We thank you for your continued commitment to Android and Google Play." It's hard to say that this is a bad thing. It will be interesting to see what Google has up its sleeve for the future of app recognition in the Play Store.

Artem Russakovskii The top developer badge stopped being meaningful to me when I saw it given out to developers with lots of bought users, reviews, tons of IAPs, etc. What I'd much rather see is a verified check mark similar to Twitter, Facebook, and G+ so people can be assured they're looking at the right dev account and not a copycat. YaKillaCJ This right here. I feel like what's needed is an Official Badge to recognized Apps. This way the average person doesn't get tricked. Gloriabtilley Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Tomáš Hubálek I was holder of Top Developer Badge for a few years but I never understood sense of this badge. I was not informed when I got it nor when I lost it. There were no clear rules who gets it. I also didn't see any marketing advantage (it didn't bring me more downloads). Chainfire XDA Same here. I did not ask to get it, and I did not ask to lose it. I did find it a bit odd to lose my badge with million upon millions of users and several apps with 4.0+ or even 4.5+ average ratings, while review-buyers and the likes retained theirs, but *shrug*. Google does as Google does. myssi This also means that Allo wouldn't inherit The Top Developer Badge anymore! Yayyyyy!!!

In addition to that, you can select a category and put it on daily change such that all the available wallpapers of that category will automatically change on your phone daily. Similar to other Android apps which also automatically change the Android wallpaper daily, this one is also the same and helps you get a fresh wallpaper every day on your Android phone. The newly launched smartphones by Google (Google Pixel) come with a built-in wallpaper app which lets you change the wallpaper automatically on daily basis and browse through dozens of HD wallpapers to set them manually. So, to make these features of Google Pixel available to every Android user who own other smartphones, Google has introduced this lightweight app called “Wallpapers“. Sponsored Links Using Google Wallpapers App to Automatically Change Android Wallpaper Daily: When you open up the “Google Wallpapers” app on your Android phone, you’ll be able to see the currently set theme, a separate folder of Android pre-listed wallpapers, and the option to use any of your existing photos as a wallpaper. At the bottom of the main screen, you’ll be able to see all the wallpaper categories offered by Google Wallpapers app. Currently, the available categories are Earth, Landscapes, Cityscapes, Life, Textures, and a category with a few live wallpapers. Now, you can simply tap on any category to browse all the available HD wallpapers inside that particular category. If you find any wallpaper interesting, then you can simply tap on it to open it up and then hit the “Set Wallpaper” button to set it as your Android phone wallpaper. When you browse any category, you’ll also see an option named, “Daily Wallpaper” at the top-left corner which can be used to turn on auto wallpaper change on daily basis. Simply tap on this option and it will pop up a confirmation dialog saying that the wallpaper will be changed automatically every day. As soon as you hit the “Continue” button on the popup dialog, the wallpaper of your Android phone will start changing on daily basis with a new photo of the selected category. As per the description of Google Wallpapers app on Google Play Store, the smartphone running Android 7.0 (Nougat) will be able to set separate wallpapers for both lock screen and home screen. But, if you’re running Marshmallow or earlier, then this feature is not available yet. My Final Verdict: If you’re looking for a way to automatically change Android phone wallpaper without any need to set wallpapers manually, then you can start using Google Wallpapers app right away. One feature which I think this app requires is that the option to set a custom wallpaper change time manually, such that you can specify a time at which you would like your wallpaper to change automatically. Otherwise, the app is great and pretty interesting to use. Get “Google Wallpapers” from here.

New Level 4 Local Guides for Google Maps will no longer receive free 100GB of Drive storage Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/03 7:30pm PDTMar 3, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 120 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Google News Local Guides is a program by Google Maps in which you "help others explore the world and get great benefits in return" (Google's words, not mine). Well, it looks like those great benefits are about to become merely average benefits, as Google is completely ditching free Drive storage for new Level 4 Local Guides, who currently get 100GB for one year. This removal of free Drive storage as a reward follows a similar event from back in July of 2016, when the promo for new Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. When that happened, we assumed that Google Maps was having too many people reach Level 4 too quickly; the same thing is probably applicable here. Here's Google's explanation: As our global community of Local Guides continues to grow, we occasionally make changes to our program. We look forward to offering our most active and consistently-contributing Local Guides more features and perks throughout the year. Not all hope is lost, though; if you're a Local Guide, you'll still receive your free 100GB if you reach Level 4 prior to March 17th at 11pm EST. As someone who's recently gotten into this whole thing, I'm probably going to be adding to my current 63 points (Level 3) quite rapidly in the span of the next two weeks.

Just reached Level 4 last week! :) mchalakov I still have my 1TB for one more year Steven Kelby Me too, but then what do we do? Forced to buy a pixel phone I guess. Or pay $125 per year. Ramon Or delete shit..Storage with expired dates shouldn't be a thing. Steven Kelby Yeah it's a trap. What a scam. JG $125 for a year doesn't sound all that bad... Though your a little high... If you buy a whole year, it's only $99.99 ($9.99/month if you pay per month). Though I really don't need a whole terabyte (right now I'm only using 1.09GBs of my 1TB+19GB)... I may go for the $19.99/year for 100GBs though... Steven Kelby I'm in Australia so it costs more here, that's AUD. I guess it's not too bad but a hard drive is much cheaper. Just need to have it networked off site at a friends house in case the house burns down! Vlad What if there's an earthquake and both your houses fall down? Steven Kelby Hopefully I'll get squashed too so it won't matter. Checkmate. Vlad That's... actually the answer I wanted. mchalakov You are not forced to do anything...your files will not be deleted even when the promo runs out. I'm pretty sure you didn't fill the full 1TB.Also you knew before that the this is a timed promotion. I really don't get the drama around here... Steven Kelby I did fill the full 1tb already, music, pics and video from my phones and cameras. It's good that it won't get deleted, I didn't know that. Đức Thành AFAIK your data won't get deleted when the extra storage expires, but in order to upload new files you'll have to either delete files to free up space or buy new space, which can be quite inconvenient at times. Kevin Brown I do too. Thanks for reminding me. I have unlimited storage through Crash Plan for my home network. I'll download my photos from Drive and upload them to Crash Plan from one of my on-site data servers. I'll write a script to pull down the photos, and let Crash Plan do its thing view every 15 minute back up. Google doesn't stick with ANYTHING, it's like an elementary school Jr Achievement "business." Never count on anything coming from Google to last. mchalakov Why ..a lot of Google services are running and lasting and still last :D Nothing is unlimited. I really doubt that you do need more than 1TB for your photos. For me on the other side - I'm working as a photographer...and I do shoot in RAW. I'm on my 2nd full TB at home :D Besides when the 1TB promo is over next year all the files will still be accessible ,you just can't upload more. Kevin Brown Tell me one service that Google's put out in the past ten years that's still running. Other than search and AdWords.. I will download because Google cannot be trusted to keep those photos. They are not customer focused one whit. I also shoot in RAW with my camera, and I too upload to my home network, which is backed up to Crash Plan. I also have a second backup to a former employer. The Google bit is just phone photos that are spur of the moment. 1639GB used as of today. That includes things like work documents, Titanium Pro backups on top of my photos. Kevin Brown Top 10 of many services Google has killed, and told customers to go eat shit and die. http://lifehacker.com/top-10-services-google-killed-off-1792897076 Andy The expiration made it pretty meaningless to me anyway.

Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Snuck right in since I got level 4 just last month Kevin Davis Damn, almost to level 4, I guess I'd better pick up the pace for the next couple of weeks, as the author mentioned. KingS I'm so glad I reached level last year shortly before they got rid of the 1TB offer. David Hyman Me too! Not that I am anywhere near my 1TB limit, it's nice to have Đức Thành How long does the 1 TB last? Fiorta Just claimed mine two days ago... Just in time it appears Ash The person who works so much to reach level 4, Google should give them atleast 50 GB free for life Samarth I second that! Vratislav Jindra I third that. SimonPieman Works so much by posting shit reviews consisting of "ok" for places they have never been to.. Google would have been better going for quality over quantity. Ash You are right. But not all are like this. I am at level 2 in 4 years and all my reviews are original and detailed plus i upload photos as well. It might take my another 1-2 years to reach level 4 Drakenoid I wrote detailed reviews in a rush last year when 1tb promotion was announced as being removed and got to level 4 and got the promotion but I was downgraded to level 3 for some reason, despite none of my reviews being basic. So it doesn't matter. You can try to do what I did, maybe you'll get this promotion. Ozl I reached level 4 by mostly uploading pictures mchalakov This is a risk of any service using user submitted content. They do review the reviews. kerma frog sound like you did it as well faggot Đức Thành If someone manages to reach level 4 in less than 4 months, they probably deserve better than 50 GB, but I'd still take what I can get. Too bad it won't even be an option. AOSPrevails I made lv4 a year ago, back when the reward was 1TB, it got so popular that Google had to nerf it to 100GB and now this. exadeci It was planned all along, they just want free workers so they attract you with advantages and make you "special" with event in their HQ but at the end of the day you work harder and for cheaper (even taking in account the advantages and events) than minimum wage workers and now that they got an army of Local Guides they don't need to offer you anything more than a "badge" Leonardo Baez I need 120pts to reach level 5, what would I get? Tizio Caio An applause Đức Thành A notification from Google that says "Congratulations on reaching Level 5 as a Local Guide!" JP How can you reach level 4 quickly? I'm at 3. Morten Ulv The quickest is probably to do quick reviews of places you've been or answer questions about places you've been. You only get one point per business if I remember correctly, so answering one question per place is enough if you really want to power through. R Gerald Saul You get one point per business, but you get a point for a review, a point for a picture, a point for updating detailed information, etc. Nicholas Conrad Airports and malls my friend. Vlad I modified the schedule of all McDonald's in my country with McDrives. They all have non-stop schedule, so I just took the list from their website and changed all of it on Google Maps. For some reason, I got dropped back to level 2 or 3 after a day, but I already redeemed my 1 TB. Drakenoid They do that, even I got dropped to level 3 (it may have been 2 but it's been an year and am on level 3 now at least) abc I've heard that being a loser with a lot of free time is very helpful. Jason Farrell Same here, but I've only reviewed stuff for fun over the years, instead of spamming crappy "OK" reviews for every little dinky place I've been to like some people do. I've got 111 of the 200 points needed to level up to lvl4, but since I'm already paying $20/yr for the 100GB there's not much point. Drakenoid Write as many detailed reviews as you can for the places you've been to, and redeem it as soon as you get to level 4. JG You can get up to 5 points per location: 1. If it's not yet on Maps, add it 2. If any information (hours, website, phone etc) is incorrect out missing, submit corrections 3. Answer some super yes/no questions 4. Write a review 5. Submit a photo You get 1 point for each, regardless if you submit multiple photos or answer multiple questions. But more never hurts. Spend a weekend walking around your local downtown, mall, and anywhere else there are a lot of businesses. If nothing else, snap a picture of each. If you know the place, answer questions about it. If you really know it, leave a review. That'll get you at least one, if not 3 points per location. Đức Thành Though these are not things I don't already have a good idea about, they're very nice and detailed tips regardless. Saved for future references, thanks. Nate Somsen I just might plug my blog, I wrote like two weeks ago, with helpful ideas on how to get those points... http://www.natesomsen.com/blog/your-guide-to-google-local-guides/ exadeci >Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. 100 GB for a year costs you $24, trying to get level 4 will consume you more time than it's value. 1TB for 2 years was $240 Marcell Lévai I have 148 points, so I need around 50 to get to level 4. Well, I guess I'll start taking photos everywhere. I am a paying Google Drive customer, but also a student, so not needing to pay for 100 gigs of Drive storage for a year would be nice. :P Ramon Yawn. Like..Why give storage only to take it away. So I fill half of that extra 100 GB. After it expires then what? "You're out of space, please delete. Spare me the stress. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The old promos for Moto X for free 1 yr. storage said anything on the drive would stay there, but you couldn't add anything when the year expired. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ And that "anything" includes email attachments, found out the hard way. Vlad No, that includes not being able to receive emails. It's on their FAQ... Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Not sure if you're trying to confirm or contradict, but since you initiated your statement with a negative I'll assume it's the latter so allow me to offer this anecdotal evidence, when my free storage period ran out I kept receiving notifications telling me to delete contents to be able to receive emails. But if in fact you're trying to confirm you should read PixelXLellence's comment and my reply again. Hint: I referenced to the "anything" on the later part of the sentence. Vlad Oops, sorry. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for the Zorak avatar https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/space-ghost.jpg?w=805 Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Heh, thanks. I tried to find someone more Evil™ than Dick Dastardly and who better than Zorak. And it worked. I'm way more evil now and the politically correct bunch finds me unequivocally detestable. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/Space_Ghost_Coast_to_Coast.png P.S. It's all in the eyes. Morten Ulv If you already pay for it, you save like 20 bucks that year. Oh joy. :P Jesús Cuenca Once i got $20 from google to use on cabify, that was nice :v Impulse_Vigil Dang, I'm at 52 pts, time to get contributing. Đức Thành You can make it. I believe in you. Miku is Best Vocaloid I need to hurry the fuck up, I'm level 3. Đức Thành Same, been contributing since January. How long have you been a Local Guide? Miku is Best Vocaloid Since September, I wasn't very active the last few months. Đức Thành How many points have you got? I had 87 points yesterday, and today I'm at 112. Wanna bet on who will level up first? :D Morten Ulv Oh right. I got level 4 back in november, but wanted to wait to redeeming it. Missed the part about expiration after 30 days. Oh well, not like I really need it anyway, seeing as photos are free and it expires after a year. JPLoureiro I contribute for fun and don't expect much in return except for some geeky stats and badges, though some credit for Google play would be nice as well. Đức Thành Same but this news still makes me upset for some reason. I wasn't even aware of the rewards before this (I was vaguely aware that there were awards for Local Guides but that's it, and I'm not even doing this for the rewards). I wonder what this phenomenon is called. Rok Tur! Another job illuminated by technology the critic LOL Same, I like to give fair reviews etc, and I always read other reviews when I go to places. Google credits or some T-shirts would be nice for every level up Chips N I wasn't aware of the program. I knew I got "points" or gained levels for it, but I thought it was just "pointless" fun, no pun intended. It would always ask me nonstop about places I've driven past or places I go in to for a quick five minutes and then leave (just browsing, etc.) If they gave even a penny for each review (in credit), I'd be a tad more tempted to put some thought into leaving a review, for places I've actually been to, of course. Trent I hit level 5 a while back and just recently passed 5,000 points. I hope and think that the reason for these scale backs is to give people like me more incentive to go for the new tiers when they're announced. Đức Thành Well fuck me, 2017 has been a quite effortful yet unrewarding year so far. Not counting many other things mostly unrelated, I've begun actively contributing to Google Maps for the last three months, and while I've added several places, made edits, posted hundreds of photos (reached over 15.000 views just a few days ago) and written quality reviews and yet this is all I got from Google: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b1f85b49be32e63f852423898894791d3b68700553c85aa1791d8352a68cbe1b.png It's just not a very fair system. And now I have to add "getting 87 more Local Guide points in the next 2 weeks" to the list of things to do, if I want to get a reward. Life just doesn't let you catch a break, as it would seem. Maxr1998 Yeah, I also think that's very unfair.. I'm living in the countryside, so it took ages for to reach lvl 3, now I won't even get storage anymore once I finally reach lvl 4. Oh, btw, 87 to 200 is an additional 113 points.. Đức Thành I feel for you man. My problem is mostly a technical one, as I find the whole process of sharing photos to Google Maps from Google Photos to be quite cumbersome (my Nexus 5 has 2-3 GB to store new photos and I back up and delete local photos every 1-2 days or so, so when I get into the mood of actually contributing to Google Maps every few days, I would have to dive into Photos, find photos of places I took few days prior and download them, then upload to Maps; and while this doesn't sound like that much of a problem it becomes a problem for me as I take a *shit load* of photos everyday). 113 points? Well shit, I guess that means more work for me, then. Shon G. I just uploaded about 20 pictures directly from Photos. Đức Thành The problem is I also want to do a review when I add photos, or at least get credited for it, but the way Maps currently implements it, if you add photos directly from Photos via Maps's suggestions it does neither and your contributions stay anonymous. Which is kinda pointless to me. Drakenoid Maps should show your photos from Google photos backup in the app itself, so try that out. Đức Thành I am well aware, what I am complaining about is Maps's current implementation of it. Đức Thành Dunno if you're interested, but I'm here to report on the progress and this is what I managed in the span of one day (going out has been costly and time-consuming and I'm wondering if this is really worth it): https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6b084860808db2c74a19d67429f11e554a5f1b88fc19f5c0b3d9f9e1c6b308b8.png So um, let's see, 88 points to go? This is getting increasingly harder than I thought. But at the same time if you view this as a game it could be quite a fun challenge. By the way, how many points have you got? I think there are a few things you can do to earn points even if you live in the countryside, like visiting monuments and adding new landmarks and whatnot. Just a suggestion. Maxr1998 Great work! I was at 104 15 minutes ago, but you reminded me to open GMaps and now I'm at 111. I might be able to get to 200 until March 17 if I push myself hard enough, but it still sucks to have to hurry so much. Also, since the promotion is only valid one year, it doesn't help me much since I have 100 GB since March 2018 anyway, because of my HTC phone from last year. Would have loved to be able to continue with a fresh year of 100 GB next year, by then finishing my Local guide lvl, but now I will probably have to pay then (I actually need the 100GB for my photos). Maxr1998 So a little update from my side, I hope that you managed to reach lvl 4, I didn't. I got to around 145, 55 more points just wasn't possible (and I still didn't reach it, currently 152). In the end I didn't even bother anymore, I'll probably just buy a subscription next year when my HTC Promotion ends, as I would have had to do anyway, so no real loss for me tbh.. Đức Thành Sorry for the late reply (thanks to crappy ISPs in my country I have had to use a VPN service every time I want to read any disqus comments and I am just too busy to bother nowadays), but here's some update from me as well. I did actually manage to reach Lv 4 more than a day before the deadline, and I still get emails from Google Maps team notifying me about how many views my photos get (more than 100.000 views the last time I checked), but I never did receive any news about the storage reward. I almost went to post a complaint on Local Guides community, but in the end I decided it wasn't worth it. So here's the funny thing: I was very active in contributing to Google Maps before, and I never really cared about getting the reward and certainly wasn't even aware that there was a reward system before I read this news about Google reducing the reward. But after this whole thing I completely stopped posting anything thanks to a lack of motivation. I think the reward system kinda ruined this hobby for me and turned it into some labor work; and thanks to how badly Google manages the reward system's actual execution, it turned into unrewarded work in the end. Now I don't even bother thinking about this as it leaves a bad taste, and it's ironic that I used to make really good photo posts and reviews before this happened, and it used to be fun. So I guess your not making it is actually a fortune thing, haha. KingS Yeah i feel ya. I got a photo with over 3 million views and it only counts as 1 point, like a photo with only 20 views. Anyways, Id recommend taking a lot of photos when youre out and about, because Google Maps will suggest you add them and they each doing as a point. Also, andere questions about businesses you've been to and keep your reviews short, but detailed. Đức Thành I already do that, maybe much more than I can possibly be expected of, simply because I like to do things properly and thoroughly, but thanks! I will keep it up. Michael D. Local guides are improving Google Maps for free, something that would otherwise would cost lots of money, and this is how Google is thanking us? I'm already a level 4 guide but seeing that there are no real benefits for all the work I've done and the data I've been submitting, I will stop doing so. I've been doing this just for fun, but in reality I've been helping them acquire costly data. Well, that's about what does it. henleyb I do it just to help others and overall hopefully ensure companies improve their services etc. The extra benefits are nice but feel a little shallow with it being for just the year. Especially since if you use it blindly you're then going to have to move all your data before it expires or start paying. Why not give 20GB for life or something, that would be a nice gesture for Google to acknowledge that while we are helping others we're also helping their company too. Either way, I find Google maps incredibly helpful for a vast range of reasons so I'm happy to contribute to 'pay back' and hopefully make it better for everyone without any rewards. Đức Thành Same, I'm a little disappointed in Google tbh but the reason I will keep contributing regardless is going to be because of the community. I was a nerd (still am) who didn't know the street names inside a 1 km diameter around my own area just a year ago, but thanks to people's contributions to Maps I can go out with much more confidence now and I am getting to know way more streets and new interesting places (even helped me with several jobs in the outskirt of my hometown), so being able to contribute back to the community can be seen as a reward in itself. Still disappointed in Google, though. Oh well. LOL Google has been a bunch of cheap little motherfuсkers lately Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Totally agreed with you, Im level 4, but lately Im losing my inspiration for contributing. Cakefish I'm currently Level 3. It's like an addictive minigame. A clever way of crowdsourcing information. Corey Munns I reached level 4 back in December but still haven't gotten my 100gb. Emily My 100 GB only lasted 4 months anyway. When it prematurely ended, I went round and round with help desk people. In the end Drive people said they couldn't help me because it was a Local Guides thing, and Local Guides people said they couldn't help because it was a Drive thing. x.Ramin What about your data? Does it get deleted too? Đức Thành Carl Sagan Dammit Google, I probably should add this "Drive vs. Local Guides rewards contradiction thing" to the "list of things to resolve when I become the head of Google one day," if that issue still hasn't been resolved by then. (Typing this with a straight face because I'm completely and totally serious.) Light I was working on it. Reviewing everywhere I went and all. Well then, I'll just stop and continue on Tripadvisor. No reward, no help building the platform. At least Tripadvisor is mainstream, so I contribute to something people actually use for reviews at least. Đức Thành TripAdvisor is even worse when it comes to the process of making contributions though. Really inconvenient and effortful, and not as many people get to reap the benefits from your reviews either. Chronos90 Do I have to do something to get this reward? I was close to Level 4 and added another review which took me to Level. Didn't got any notice yet LOL I'm almost level 6 bitchеs Margaritas Ante Porcos People are as greedy as orthodox priests. All good deeds need to be paid, otherwise no reviews. eep2378 Good thing I'm level 4 already...😀 Ailín Ó’S I still have the 1TB of free storage but I'm not sure how I feel about this. On one hand it will help limit people reviewing places they've never been to with a "cool" or "good" or whatever just to get the points but on the other it no longer incentivises people to genuinely contribute to the app and make it better. belac77 I wonder if they'll replace it with another perk? mchalakov Whoa...chill everybody. Even though we as Local Guides are helping Google ,we are also helping each other. Especially in some areas which you don't have any information. The moment you started doing this you knew there is going to be nothing in return or if there is anything it's a limited promotion. So if you want 100GB buy it it's $2 /month. kerma frog how bout no? Maleko Wow... I did a lot to get to Level 4 to redeem that free storage, and I did it with decent photos and decent reviews etc... Firstly it's pointless to have the storage expire, especially when Google don't offer 500GB in their storage tariff. Now to remove the incentive totally... dick move. GarethSargeant 100 reviews since yesterday. Sticking with places I've been to though. My name is…. And thats why they dont offer GB any more. Nate Somsen You'd think that Google would have some kind of algorithm to detect an unnatural increase in contributions in such a short amount of time... Đức Thành Why though? Regardless of the frequency of new photos and reviews, it's the accuracy and quality that matters, right? Some people like to take lots of photos of places but don't contribute right away every time, and when they do it in their spare time just have to batch-process a bunch of new places, I think it should be fair game. Ohid Khan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6d2b4544c67bb885685a2487b72f82a4d31c0735e832702b911d6210b1a3a29c.jpg Wendy’s Angels Does she come from a pedophile family? She's another like chelsea handler, with her old slutty self, creaming over Obama. Doby Gillis Your dementia is kicking in. WTF does that have to do with the article? Dirge No worries, I got the 1TB free for 2 years back in July. TheScienceEnthusiast1130 LMFAO Google = $$$ SB Level 5 - 167 photos - over a million views. Geoff Johnson Glad I got in when it was 1TB, which is good through March 2018. Андрей Бельский And what if i have been of 4th level (long ago) and will reach 5th level. will I get this 100gb storage as promotion? Biggles Remember when the Google motto was "don't be evil"? We've done a pile of work for Google for free. It'd cost them a lot of money to either buy the data if they could buy it somewhere, or cost them a lot of money to hire people to do data entry. Either way, it saved them forking out. And it improved their search and maps tremendously, so that it strengthened their grip of the market and they make yet more money. The cost to them was drive space, and probably so little in financial terms that they'd struggle to actual calculate it. People are upset less because of the cost of Drive storage, less because the perks changed, but more because Google made out they cared about their users and having a community of local guides. And it turns out that they don't care. Anthony I'm happy I hit level 4 back when it was 1tb. I didnt know it went down. Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/18c73e40001f06e7055d333e9d4ad4b7ac0a0c1db1e2b065f1971cce06ae3d02.png Omega192 ITT a bunch of entitled whiners. Oh, you've "done a pile of work for Google for free"? They've been providing many if not most of their services to you for free, Maps included. If you really cba to contribute to Maps unless you're given something in return, then go right ahead and stop contributing. No one is forcing you to continue. Wouldn't be surprised if this was brought on by people leaving low effort reviews just to get to the point they were rewarded. God forbid Google take steps to lessen that rather than just shell out unlimited rewards at a loss. chimichanga I've reached level 4 a few days ago but still haven't seen an increase in Google Drive space. How long does this usually take? Was thinking it would be more or less imminent. chimichanga all good, have actually received it now Vladislav Shumkin so the bonus drive space just arrives later automatically? or you need to apply somewhere to redeem? chimichanga yes, an email to activate the free storage arrived around 3 days after I reached level 4 Anthony C Russano III I was lucky enough to secure the FREE 1TB before they pulled it.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Bill Perrotta What in the world are you are talking about? Supposedly this happened a day ago and I didn't even notice it. Everything is normal right now. Scofabear Is anyone having issues with Google now weather cards showing the wrong location? Amit_N Seriously.. on weekend? Why are Googlers working on weekends? Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 32 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares177 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. Jay In my case, I created the account for my kid just to reserve the name so that by the time he's old enough he doesn't have to have [email protected] I also use it to write to him so he's got emails from me throughout his whole life that he can go back and read one day. Finally, though the email address is his name, it's *my* account until I choose to hand it over, therefore it's not violating any guidelines or terms since I'm over 13 and the other info on the account is mine. Rather than add "his" Google Account to my family account, what I'm hoping Google will do is allow me to transfer "my" other, existing Google account to him now under the family account. You're using semantics to make it seem like he's using an account he shouldn't have against the rules, and that's not the case in my situation. SBBH I've done the exact same thing and also wish Google would make this work with existing emails. Violet There's also the fact that in order for an Android phone to work, you have to have a Google account. So, if your kids get phones before they're thirteen, there's going to be some fudging of birth years during setup. SBBH Yep, not sure why they've waited so long to address this when for years now every kid has had a phone and because of that an email address. I know there are administrator and guest accounts or something like that (can't remember the exact names) in Android but I've found it often doesn't work as advertised or the older phones simply don't support it. I think the government also needs to update the laws a bit when it comes to this. IMHO AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

Unable to use my GSuite account for their Family Plan let alone Family Link. jj14x Gsuite - "A set of intelligent apps including Gmail, Docs, Drive and Calendar to connect the people in *your company*, no matter where in the world they are." Not saying it wouldn't be a good thing, but given that GSuite is designed to be a product for work, don't be surprised if it doesn't really materialize Alan Cramer My GSuite was obtained back when it was Google Apps for your Domain which one of the suggested uses was for families....over the years the focus has dropped off as they focus more and more on their pay for product. Infamous_Elsa It still needs app restrictions and website blocking like iOS Tired_Guy I have maybe an unusual situation but likely not and I did bring it to Google's attention but... My son is 25 but IDD and is like a big 5 year old. He does not yet have a legal guardian, but seriously, he will forever be a minor. I set him up a gmail account for his tablet and because many social services ask for one and it's nice to let him have one of his "own". The mail comes to me anyway. He gets music off the family plan google play and Red and we can keep his music and video choices separate from ours. Having an account means we can set him up on a new device pretty quickly at least as his favorite stuff goes. But a lot of what FL offers is stuff I'd love to be able to do in one place rather than doing it all ad hoc. Trust me, if I die, his mom isn't going to deal with the hows and whys of managing his account, access, email, browsing etc. And yes, app restrictions would be such a bonus as the existing stuff out there really sucks and I'm constantly getting the kid off the password screes and back to his video because he his something he shouldn't have. But beyond COPA and age 13, tere are a ton of parents like me with adult children who are disabled who'd love to be able to allow their kids internet access while managing it for them. John Stacy Please Google, let those of us who are using the Apps for Domains accounts, that were billed as great for families, be used for family sharing and family library. J.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares197 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. LondonLeedsFan Absolutely. Release a product, sell it at full price, and provide us with a limited, half-baked and delayed service. Thanks Google! xyz First of all, you should know that no one gives a shit about your feelings. Anyway, nothing funnier than people who are ignorant about everything outside their borders lecturing people on their country's law and regulations. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? LondonLeedsFan Mate, if you want Downton Abbey, you're more than welcome to it! ;) Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english? Lars Jeppesen Yes, language is US English, also on my phone LondonLeedsFan We don't even have podcasts on Play Music yet in the UK. Tiuri Elvander For some reason I just got them this weekend. Go to the Play Music website and log out and log in again. Maybe if you have a secondary google account, try that and then return to your main account. I logged in using my dad's account and then when I logged in using my own account again, I got the new look (mid 2016 look) Play Music, including podcasts!

Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! Jack Smith Wow! Thanks. Never realized you could do this. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd. Paul Quinn I debated on that. I think I prefer the ominous nature of it. Reminds me of THE Borg. xyz It's appropriate because now Google can listen to everything you say at home. Nick Riviera It works terribly, like quite a few new services. Amit Interesting. No such issues for me. I haven't found home to falter even once, from what I asked for... el conejo Don't worry I'll place a logic bomb called "America Only" and that sh*t will blow up your network trafficking toolkit Paul Quinn We've updated the article because some of you are able to get this to work outside the US. Thanks for that info! Zsolt V How about checking first before spreading FUD? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. CD RW can't wait to have my nightly ASMR from Google Badouken I've been using this when reading, it makes for a relaxing read. surethom Does not work here in the UK. Unless u have to pay for subscription which I don't. Blake Sinnett They need to add this. https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA Paul Quinn Totally! Tell your Home.... Say, "Hey Google, I want to give feedback." Jack Smith Are you not the author? Are you not suppose to know the device? The poster can do this on the GH no problem and should that not be the answer? Jack Smith You can use it and I do similar with others. Just ask your GH to play it. Most nights we listen say at bedtime "hey google play 10 hours of thunderstorms" and it plays it from YouTube. But thanks for sharing because this is what I will use this evening for sure. Hope the wife does not mind. Jack Smith Love the ambient sounds built-in. But my preference right now is the 10 hours of thunderstorms with flutes from YouTube. Highly recommend. The problem with the others is they do not last long enough. Jack Smith Well re-reading article I am a dork. Never thought to ask for a time period with the built-in white noise. Jack Smith This is not a US only thing you just can play ambient or white noise from YouTube and we do it all the time. Tons more selection and some really good ones. But I really wish the author would know the GH better and share such things. Everytime he writes on the GH drives me nuts as pretty much every time there is incorrect information or something misleading or key points missing and has to be cleaned up in the comments area. Why? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. The difference here (and the point of the article) was that the GH has this feature built in and includes the ability to set a timer with it. The GH has always been able to play audio tracks of any kind. I guess I could have mentioned this alternate means of playing ambient sound in a sentence. Thanks for the feedback! I am new to this so it all just fine tunes my writing! Cory S If you tell it to play it to a chromecast, they appear to just be existing youtube videos.

Google announces Family Link, a tool for creating and managing Google accounts for kids under 13 Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/15 9:55am PDTMar 15, 2017 123 Plus 1 on G+ 311 Share on Facebook 92 Share on Twitter Total Shares526 Google News Google has never allowed anyone under the age of 13 to have a Google account, and certainly no one would ever lie about their age on the internet. Right? Well, now you don't have to lie with the new Family Link app. Family Link (invite-only and US-only for now) lets you create a Google account for your under-13 offspring with advanced parental controls built-in. There are some caveats, but this seems like a tool many parents will be anxious to check out. Setting up a Family Link account for your kid can only be done through the Family Link app, which is also what you use to manage the account and monitor device activity. One major drawback is that your child needs to be using a Nougat phone, but you can use Family Link to tightly control that device. It includes screen time tracking, bedtime schedules, and app rating limits. When setting up an account, you will be asked to pay $0.30. This isn't a blatant cash grab by Google—the FTC requires verifiable parental consent when collecting personal information about kids, and credit card payments are the easiest approved method. You could "object" to collection after seeing the charge on your account. Family Link is only for kids under the age of 13, but you have options as soon as the child hits that age. Parents and kids can keep using Family Link if they like. However, Google will reach out and give the birthday boy or girl the option of transitioning to a regular Google account, over which their parents have no control. I imagine most will take Google up on that offer. I hear teenagers are rebellious. If you want to check out Family Link, request an invite from the landing page. There's also some additional legal info you can review if you're feeling a little skittish about feeding your child's data into the gaping maw of Google.

Wife and I were just discussing parental oversight on smartphones. This is the perfect time for this beta for me! Hope the invites come soon. Bill Stebbins The kid's device must be running Nougat 7.0? I'd suspect this is missing a huge population of kids using hand-me-down devices (including mine). Mike in KC Well just buy a new device, problem solved 😉.... Lol, yeah I immediately thought the same thing. dxdydz Now you guys have an excuse to upgrade sooner! Arturo Campos Yeah, that's simply ridiculous silver_arrow Probably some nougat tech that lets them do this. Also it's an issue now but wait 2-3 years and you're golden. RyanWhitwam It won't seem as ridiculous in a few months. Cheap Nougat phones will happen. Probably no way to make these features work on Marshmallow. Bill Stebbins Agreed. My youngest will turn 13 in a year, so it won't benefit me, and I agree they have to start somewhere. Hopefully they will have an amnesty program for us to "correct" our kid's existing accounts jlatimer11 I'm pretty much in the same boat. By the time they get phones that could use it they'll be 13 and 14. Kyle Or just find a hand me down phoine that will support a nougat ROM, if you are able to do that. Bill Stebbins Wanna take any bets on this not supporting rooted devices? Kyle I don't doubt there will be some shenanagins like that. But you would think that the G would be happy that their later OS's are being used, even if it is not on the latest flagships. JSo I thought this was going to be something that would link families together between devices. Like a way to share things easier between family members, connect to people that are close to you better and stuff like that. This is just a parental control app. Bradley Ruiz so all the games/progress already installed using my account on his device are gone after setting a new account :S SavageJeep They still have the Family Library ability if it works for you... https://play.google.com/store/family/create?hl=en F4LL0U7 Awesome, now my wife and I can officially start trying to get pregnant, with the knowledge that our child will be born with their own Google account! (Yes, that is important to me!) Tim Stevens Great...so than everyone knows how old the kids are using their "kids" account...nice for people who like little children...i dont even feel safe on my own account...they know everything about a person these days....i rather lie about their birthday and check my kids behaviour myself once in a while... Nougat is easy...install a rom. Vantius > Nougat is easy...install a rom. Not if you're a non-tech literate parent and just want a service to do that. iZi My kids are 101 and 104 years old... :p I hope I will be able to change their age when they turn 113! Iain Mabbott Great idea (apart from the whole US only and Nougat requirements!) MJ Why do kids under 13 need phones or Google accounts? INCOMING! archie27 my kids are issued a school account (g-suite) in 5th grade (age ~10). MJ OK? That's fine if the school uses Android tablets or Chromebooks in class. brekfest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk Google already answered the question years ago. codemonkey85 Honestly, no one at any age "needs" those things. :-P That said, my son had an email address the day after he was born. I've got a lot of ideas for how to structure family stuff using apps like Todoist and Google Calendar! MJ Cool... My kids (that will never exist) would have to show basic proficiently with the command line before their first tablet or Windows PC. :-) Vantius You sound like a heartless dick. MJ Yes, it's heartless to have your kids learn something. You are obviously from the gimme I am entitled generation. Your kids don't have a smartphones and they are 8 years old? Child abuse! codemonkey85 Haha, to each his own. I say embrace the future - my kids probably won't know devices existed without touch screens. MJ I have been embracing the future for almost 50 years now. I would think parents would want their kids to learn how tech works and just not play with it. codemonkey85 I thought you were okay until that last remark about food service. You can have an opinion without being a dick. MJ Dude, I am just stating a truth. The workplace is a global competition now. In China, kids are learning advanced math, coding, and how tech actually works before high school. Many educational institutions actually think just putting consumer devices like tablets in schools will some how make kids prepared for the future. Skills like typing, writing/penmanship, and being able to properly verbally communicate (stuff rarely talked about these days) is what is going to set the young people of the future apart from their peers NOT being on the latest social network. Hell, you know so many kids today don't know how to properly shake a hand? That's like the first step in gaining respect in a business situation. Learning how to do things manually or the "hard" way is always useful even if just do it once. I have been driving a automatic transmission since like 21 but I know how to drive a manual shift. I am sure you know why that may be a good idea. Rant over... codemonkey85 I don't disagree, but if you insult my children or my parenting of course I'm going to dismiss you. That being said, I'm a professional developer (mostly C#) and I very rarely need to use command-line tools, and there *are* still jobs that don't require advanced computer science. In any case I think my kids will figure it out, just like I did. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I agree. i think an old school flipphone AT MOST. Jax Spade Needed this when I got my son a phone... Now he just has a full account and everything already set up. They should have done something like this years ago. archie27 need this to work on chromebooks too Zach Mauch Honestly, we need Andromeda with google controlled updates so all devices are instantly on the same OS/version and compatible. Way too much fragmentation with Google. Steve Galbincea "Family Link is not available for your account at this time." Sigh. Hopefully one day Google will get things right. resource Getting this too. Any idea why some people are being told their account isn't eligible? Dn Bro I may have missed an edit in this article, but it does state in the article it is invite only...Just saying. Markus Eyrich U.S. only..pfff m-p{3} Might not be a technological issue, but a legal one. HotRodJohnson What if your child already has an account via Google Education? Does it allow a linkup to those accounts? David Hyman As well as migrating an existing email account to this. We have emails for both of our kids so we can send them emails like that Gmail commercial from years past. I would definitely like to get them onto this family link thing if possible codemonkey85 "One major drawback is that your child needs to be using a Nougat phone" ...Seriously? I thought Google was a services company. My two-year-old son is not getting a brand new Nougat phone so I can set up an email address for him for when he's older. Abhilash Bingi A used Nexus 5X isn't all that expensive? Adam Margeson A used Nexus 5 is even less. Abhilash Bingi It might be a bit too old and doesn't have Nougat officially. Adam Margeson Fair point. I occasionally forget that some people don't use custom ROMs. I've been using it since I heard about CM when I had my Dream (HTC G1), so it's something I always consider an option as a knee-jerk reaction. codemonkey85 I don't like custom ROMS. They tend to break things. codemonkey85 It's the principle though. Why do I need a hardware device to activate a web service? I just want the email. pfmiller If the account is for when he's older, why would he need the phone to use now? codemonkey85 I just like to be prepared. 😜 Christopher Bement Maybe you missed the part where it's in beta. And made by Google so don't expect much. And your child is 2. Tomáš Petrík When he reaches the age when it actually makes sense to have a phone, there will be plenty of cheap second-hand devices with that old Nougat version. Simps Damn. U.S Only, Google makes me wait for everything lol Zach Mauch This sounds like the start of something I have been very much wanting for a while. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Sounds great, but now they need a way to grand amnesty to those of us who had to give up and lie to get our kids accounts so we could get them on devices before this was available and let us update and import those. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ i dont think kids under 13 need phones. maybe the likes of a jitterbug?? i'm like half kidding Adam Margeson Do I seem like an old fart if I say that I don't think that children should have cell phones/tablets and the like except for safety situations such as being at school before the doors open or after they close or walking to/from there. I don't care if they play on consoles or computers, but I don't like the idea of sticking a child in front of any screen for extended periods of time. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ i dont really disagree with it. other are going to scoff at this but oh well. i dont think my kids needs a phone with all these apps/games on them. at this age, they need to be able to make a phone call or receive a phone call. Thats it. Hank No, I would never lie about my kids age to create Google account. :-) My kid has a Samsung tablet that should get Nougat in the not too distant future. I assume this would work on a tablet and not just a phone. Would be nice if I could hook the existing Google account up to it and fix the age rather than creating a new ID and losing the apps and content he's already purchased using gift cards. Matt Williams Funny that the device has to be running Nougat, but the phone in the example is the Nexus 5, which ended at Marshmallow. Darnell If you go through the invite process and select "No" when at the point about Nougat, then they will tell you to continue if you want. Then they ask if you plan to get your kid a device that will work and select "No" again, they will let you continue, with notification when the app is generally available for Non-Nougat devices. So everyone interested, should get in on the invite process. And if you don't qualify today, they will let you know when you do. I've got kids still rocking 2013 Nexus 7s. andrey3000 "Only in America". Donald Trump has to love Google's America First Beta Philosophy! :( Adam Margeson Anyone else notice that Google is still using a Nexus 5 silhouette for their screenshots? Leeav Amar When available I will test this on my Nexus 7 2013. It is running Lineage OS 14.1 (based on Nougat 7.1.1). Carson Saldanha Can you set this up for your child without them needing a phone? Fiorta Needs nougat? Really? How many kids under 13 have devices that run nougat? Hell, most adults don't even have it at this point... JG and certainly no one would ever lie about their age on the internet. Right? You've apparently never ran into a block like Are you at least 18? Yes, let me in No, get me out of here Not saying that I ever did either... ::Whistles:: sodsavage I would like to see them pull in Android Device Manager capabilities so you can track the device from this app. Would be nice to even include a route/map and timeline of destinations for the past X amount of hours/days. David Yes, but is there a way to convert an existing Google Account INTO a Child's account? grazapin Yeah, I created accounts for my kids so they would have unique IDs for Hangouts on the tablets they used regularly. Now that we've been using those accounts for a while I don't want to create new ones in Family Link, but if I could convert them I probably would. movemint just got my invite and wondering the same thing. Basic search in Google help has yielded no answers. jdrch LMFAO. Nice way to catch up, Google. Microsoft has had Family and child account functionality across the board for aeons now. ecnjnr "Google has never allowed anyone under the age of 13 to have a Google account" Actually, that's not true. Certain Verizon devices back in the Gingerbread era let you create a Google account on the setup screen without entering your age or agreeing that you were 13. https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/knowledge-base-105462/ I, uh, may have taken advantage of this. Iamsecond US only, and Nougat only? Someone please remind Google they are a massive international company with a huge user base that mostly does not have Nougat. AQ Useful bits from the FAQ you could update/clarify in the post: "Can Family Link manage “regular” Google accounts? No. Family Link can only manage Google accounts for kids under 13. These accounts can only be created via Family Link." Devices: "Parents can run Family Link on Android devices running KitKat (4.4) and higher. Family Link is not available for parents on iOS at this time. Kids can run Family Link on Android devices running Nougat (7.0) and higher, along with the following Marshmallow (6.1) devices: Alcatel Dawn Alcatel Fierce 4 Alcatel Pixi Unite LG K3 LG Stylo 2 Plus LG X Power Samsung Galaxy Luna Samsung Galaxy Tab A Sony Xperia X Family Link is not available for kids on iOS at this time." Anthrox They really need to Support the Nexus 7 (2013) with this program LibbysH8Me I wish the play store for add a tab for purchased apps.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

He and a few other individuals across the globe have come together under the aegis of Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy (AAID) in Paris to demand "protection of private integrity and societal value" on the Internet. "Twenty of us from all over the world have come together and we want big companies like Facebook and Google to take responsibility for their content," Pitroda said while addressing a gathering of Pune International Centre members and others at the College of Engineering here. He said unlike newspapers, big companies like Google and Facebook do not take responsibility for their content. "If newspapers publish incorrect information, they will apologise. On the other hand, Google and Facebook won't even remove the content. So, this has been bothering us for quite some time," he said. Pitroda said that there is concern over a lot of misinformation, gossip and vendetta on social media. "By design, people propagate misinformation because it gets them more hits," the technology veteran added. The man, who also served as advisor to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said some people hire publicists to tweet on their behalf. "There is a difference between propaganda and information," said the man who is credited with laying the telecommunication roadmap for the country in the 1980s. He stressed the need for a new design to the world order in the Internet age and said India - because of its value system, family bonds and social cohesion - is best suited to build that design. "World can only be redesigned by Indians but we are not ready to take on a task like this because our house is not in order. Today, the world is waiting for India to take the lead. People want family values, love, compassion -- all of which India has and also it has costumes, colour, food, diversity. No other country has that kind of diversity. To hold a country with so much diversity without guns is one of India's greatest accomplishments," he added.

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 32 Plus 1 on G+ 73 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares177 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. Jay In my case, I created the account for my kid just to reserve the name so that by the time he's old enough he doesn't have to have [email protected] I also use it to write to him so he's got emails from me throughout his whole life that he can go back and read one day. Finally, though the email address is his name, it's *my* account until I choose to hand it over, therefore it's not violating any guidelines or terms since I'm over 13 and the other info on the account is mine. Rather than add "his" Google Account to my family account, what I'm hoping Google will do is allow me to transfer "my" other, existing Google account to him now under the family account. You're using semantics to make it seem like he's using an account he shouldn't have against the rules, and that's not the case in my situation. SBBH I've done the exact same thing and also wish Google would make this work with existing emails. Violet There's also the fact that in order for an Android phone to work, you have to have a Google account. So, if your kids get phones before they're thirteen, there's going to be some fudging of birth years during setup. SBBH Yep, not sure why they've waited so long to address this when for years now every kid has had a phone and because of that an email address. I know there are administrator and guest accounts or something like that (can't remember the exact names) in Android but I've found it often doesn't work as advertised or the older phones simply don't support it. I think the government also needs to update the laws a bit when it comes to this. IMHO AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing.

Not necessary to build your personal website domains and many more., all will be presented to you 100% free. Visitors definitely will browse the landing page so you are going to get compensated for that. Its as simple as that.

Unable to use my GSuite account for their Family Plan let alone Family Link. jj14x Gsuite - "A set of intelligent apps including Gmail, Docs, Drive and Calendar to connect the people in *your company*, no matter where in the world they are." Not saying it wouldn't be a good thing, but given that GSuite is designed to be a product for work, don't be surprised if it doesn't really materialize Alan Cramer My GSuite was obtained back when it was Google Apps for your Domain which one of the suggested uses was for families....over the years the focus has dropped off as they focus more and more on their pay for product. Infamous_Elsa It still needs app restrictions and website blocking like iOS Tired_Guy I have maybe an unusual situation but likely not and I did bring it to Google's attention but... My son is 25 but IDD and is like a big 5 year old. He does not yet have a legal guardian, but seriously, he will forever be a minor. I set him up a gmail account for his tablet and because many social services ask for one and it's nice to let him have one of his "own". The mail comes to me anyway. He gets music off the family plan google play and Red and we can keep his music and video choices separate from ours. Having an account means we can set him up on a new device pretty quickly at least as his favorite stuff goes. But a lot of what FL offers is stuff I'd love to be able to do in one place rather than doing it all ad hoc. Trust me, if I die, his mom isn't going to deal with the hows and whys of managing his account, access, email, browsing etc. And yes, app restrictions would be such a bonus as the existing stuff out there really sucks and I'm constantly getting the kid off the password screes and back to his video because he his something he shouldn't have. But beyond COPA and age 13, tere are a ton of parents like me with adult children who are disabled who'd love to be able to allow their kids internet access while managing it for them.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares197 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. LondonLeedsFan Absolutely. Release a product, sell it at full price, and provide us with a limited, half-baked and delayed service. Thanks Google! xyz First of all, you should know that no one gives a shit about your feelings. Anyway, nothing funnier than people who are ignorant about everything outside their borders lecturing people on their country's law and regulations. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? LondonLeedsFan Mate, if you want Downton Abbey, you're more than welcome to it! ;) Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english? Lars Jeppesen Yes, language is US English, also on my phone LondonLeedsFan We don't even have podcasts on Play Music yet in the UK. Tiuri Elvander For some reason I just got them this weekend. Go to the Play Music website and log out and log in again. Maybe if you have a secondary google account, try that and then return to your main account. I logged in using my dad's account and then when I logged in using my own account again, I got the new look (mid 2016 look) Play Music, including podcasts! Srujan Probably for those panicking over losing healthcare protection on their pre-existing conditions. ericshmerick We get it, you don't like him. Your post is wholly inaccurate by the way. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing.

Not necessary to build your personal website domains and many more., all will be presented to you 100% free. Visitors definitely will browse the landing page so you are going to get compensated for that. Its as simple as that. I'm getting big profits from home from this work exactly like $20000 every month and sometimes more and if you also actually want to get paid same as that then follow these particular not very difficult directions by looking at this homepage .... ➤➤➤http:[email protected] .. Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! Jack Smith Wow! Thanks. Never realized you could do this. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd. Paul Quinn I debated on that. I think I prefer the ominous nature of it. Reminds me of THE Borg. xyz It's appropriate because now Google can listen to everything you say at home. Nick Riviera It works terribly, like quite a few new services. Amit Interesting. No such issues for me. I haven't found home to falter even once, from what I asked for... el conejo Don't worry I'll place a logic bomb called "America Only" and that sh*t will blow up your network trafficking toolkit Paul Quinn We've updated the article because some of you are able to get this to work outside the US. Thanks for that info! Zsolt V How about checking first before spreading FUD? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. CD RW can't wait to have my nightly ASMR from Google Badouken I've been using this when reading, it makes for a relaxing read. surethom Does not work here in the UK. Unless u have to pay for subscription which I don't. Blake Sinnett They need to add this. https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA Paul Quinn Totally! Tell your Home.... Say, "Hey Google, I want to give feedback." Jack Smith Are you not the author? Are you not suppose to know the device? The poster can do this on the GH no problem and should that not be the answer? Jack Smith You can use it and I do similar with others. Just ask your GH to play it. Most nights we listen say at bedtime "hey google play 10 hours of thunderstorms" and it plays it from YouTube. But thanks for sharing because this is what I will use this evening for sure. Hope the wife does not mind. Jack Smith Love the ambient sounds built-in. But my preference right now is the 10 hours of thunderstorms with flutes from YouTube. Highly recommend. The problem with the others is they do not last long enough. Jack Smith Well re-reading article I am a dork. Never thought to ask for a time period with the built-in white noise. Jack Smith This is not a US only thing you just can play ambient or white noise from YouTube and we do it all the time. Tons more selection and some really good ones. But I really wish the author would know the GH better and share such things. Everytime he writes on the GH drives me nuts as pretty much every time there is incorrect information or something misleading or key points missing and has to be cleaned up in the comments area. Why? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. The difference here (and the point of the article) was that the GH has this feature built in and includes the ability to set a timer with it. The GH has always been able to play audio tracks of any kind. I guess I could have mentioned this alternate means of playing ambient sound in a sentence. Thanks for the feedback! I am new to this so it all just fine tunes my writing! Cory S If you tell it to play it to a chromecast, they appear to just be existing youtube videos.

Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. Jay In my case, I created the account for my kid just to reserve the name so that by the time he's old enough he doesn't have to have [email protected] I also use it to write to him so he's got emails from me throughout his whole life that he can go back and read one day. Finally, though the email address is his name, it's *my* account until I choose to hand it over, therefore it's not violating any guidelines or terms since I'm over 13 and the other info on the account is mine. Rather than add "his" Google Account to my family account, what I'm hoping Google will do is allow me to transfer "my" other, existing Google account to him now under the family account. You're using semantics to make it seem like he's using an account he shouldn't have against the rules, and that's not the case in my situation. SBBH I've done the exact same thing and also wish Google would make this work with existing emails. Violet There's also the fact that in order for an Android phone to work, you have to have a Google account. So, if your kids get phones before they're thirteen, there's going to be some fudging of birth years during setup. SBBH Yep, not sure why they've waited so long to address this when for years now every kid has had a phone and because of that an email address. I know there are administrator and guest accounts or something like that (can't remember the exact names) in Android but I've found it often doesn't work as advertised or the older phones simply don't support it. I think the government also needs to update the laws a bit when it comes to this. IMHO AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

Unable to use my GSuite account for their Family Plan let alone Family Link. jj14x Gsuite - "A set of intelligent apps including Gmail, Docs, Drive and Calendar to connect the people in *your company*, no matter where in the world they are." Not saying it wouldn't be a good thing, but given that GSuite is designed to be a product for work, don't be surprised if it doesn't really materialize Alan Cramer My GSuite was obtained back when it was Google Apps for your Domain which one of the suggested uses was for families....over the years the focus has dropped off as they focus more and more on their pay for product. Infamous_Elsa It still needs app restrictions and website blocking like iOS Tired_Guy I have maybe an unusual situation but likely not and I did bring it to Google's attention but... My son is 25 but IDD and is like a big 5 year old. He does not yet have a legal guardian, but seriously, he will forever be a minor. I set him up a gmail account for his tablet and because many social services ask for one and it's nice to let him have one of his "own". The mail comes to me anyway. He gets music off the family plan google play and Red and we can keep his music and video choices separate from ours. Having an account means we can set him up on a new device pretty quickly at least as his favorite stuff goes. But a lot of what FL offers is stuff I'd love to be able to do in one place rather than doing it all ad hoc. Trust me, if I die, his mom isn't going to deal with the hows and whys of managing his account, access, email, browsing etc. And yes, app restrictions would be such a bonus as the existing stuff out there really sucks and I'm constantly getting the kid off the password screes and back to his video because he his something he shouldn't have. But beyond COPA and age 13, tere are a ton of parents like me with adult children who are disabled who'd love to be able to allow their kids internet access while managing it for them. John Stacy Please Google, let those of us who are using the Apps for Domains accounts, that were billed as great for families, be used for family sharing and family library. J.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares210 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess.

Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me.

Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups.

Currently, though, there seems to be an issue with the service, rendering it useless to affected users. Thankfully, though, a temporary fix is available. The best gifts for Android users Update: Android Police has been able to trace the cause of this issue back to a server-side test, as well as confirming the same cause for a Google Play bug that removes all content from the main screen. Since this is a server-side test, not all phones or accounts will be affected, but users who are will likely have to sit tight until Google resolves things. According to several users on a growing Reddit thread, multiple users on Twitter, as well as both myself and my colleague Abner Li, Google Now has been having some issues for the past few days. For reasons unknown, the service refuses the cards that give it its functionality, instead simply showing the message “failed to load cards,” regardless of the network connection. For me, the issue has only been appearing on my Pixel XL (Android 7.1.2), not my Galaxy S8 or my Huawei Mate 9. Looking at user reports on Reddit, Pixel and Nexus devices seem to be the most affected, with some other miscellaneous devices, including the Galaxy S8, seeing the same issue. It also isn’t happening solely in the US, with reports coming from multiple regions around the globe including the UK. Thankfully, though, one Reddit user has a working fix for the problem. Simply clearing the Google app’s data seems to eliminate the issue. To do this, simply go into Settings > Application Manager > Google App > Manage Space > Clear Google Search Data. Once you’ve done that, your cards should start working again.

Name: Subject: Message: People are using more apps now than ever before Newsby Joe Hindy1 day ago 10 579 33 The rhetoric regarding apps hasn’t changed much over the years. Every year, people are using more and more for longer periods of time. As it turns out, 2016 wasn’t much different. According to a report by App Annie, people spent nearly one trillion hours in apps in 2016. That trend is looking to continue into 2017. Let’s take a look at the latest numbers and dive more into the topic. Related Articles:   App Annie: For the first time, Android app spending will ...March 30, 2017 The first graph shows that people used apps 25% more often in Q1 2016 than the previous quarter. App Annie hypothesizes that it’s because the smartphone user base has grown so substantially. More phones are coming out in more places that didn’t previously have smartphones. Thus, the conclusion isn’t that people are using apps more often. Rather, there are simply more people using apps than there were before. The graph above doesn’t seem like it adds up to almost one trillion hours. However, keep in mind that this graph is just for Android phones. As it turns out, virtually all of us have apps that we don’t normally use. On average, we only use between 1/3 and 1/2 of the apps we have installed on any given month (based on region). There are a variety of reasons why this could be. Many devices have pre-installed apps that people simply never use. Additionally, apps like file managers, background downloaders, and other productivity types may see infrequent use. For instance, many people use Google Docs, but how many have downloaded Slides and Sheets and then only occasionally use them? App Annie mentions the importance of retention as a measurement of success. After all, the most successful apps are the ones people actually use. In every region they measured, App Annie was unable to find a demographic that doesn’t use at least nine different apps per day. Most had over ten apps used per day. That seems like a lot. However, if you take into account that virtually everything you do in a phone requires an app, the numbers add up quickly. The report notes that the app types used every day vary widely as well. Thus, it’s not just communication and social media, but also productivity, tools, utilities, shopping, entertainment, and others. The conclusion is that we aren’t just using a bunch of apps every day, but rather that we’re using a bunch of different types every day. Based on the graph above, people use four different tools and four communication apps per month. App Annie posits that this is likely because of pre-installed apps that people actually do use. Google Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS, etc. It’s also worth mentioning that Cortana and Google Assistant fall under the tools category and they count as well. Android users play more games than iOS users do. However, iOS users use a larger variety of social media platforms than Android users. The important thing to note for this, though, is how many different varieties of apps that people use every month. On average, people in the United States spend one month out of every year using an app of some sort. That averages out to about two hours and 15 minutes per day. In fact, the amount of time spent per day has increased every year since 2015. Really, there isn’t a lot of additional analysis here. It’s another graph that shows that people are spending more time using their phones. App Annie’s research concluded that most people spent over 80% of their time not in the top app in their country. The top app in any given country is usually Facebook or WhatsApp. App Annie states that this means that other app developers have plenty of time. However, we feel like there is more to it than that. For instance, a person may check Facebook many times a day for a minute at a time. On the other hand, Google Maps may only be opened once for ten minutes for the daily commute. We would love to see a “per session” metric as well to see how often and how long people spend in an app every time they visit for a more complete view of peoples daily activity. App Annie did provide a graph to show the number of sessions per day and time per session. Most of this makes a lot of sense. Transportation had fewer sessions per day but more time per session. Likewise, finance had more sessions per day, but less time per session. After all, it doesn’t take but a few moments to check your bank balance. Social media is curiously absent from the graph. We imagine that’s because people use them for more sessions per day than this graph is set up to handle. Dating is a surprising case with both high sessions per day and minutes per session. The final image deals with gaming. Like apps, gaming has been on the rise for a few years. South Korea and Japan have the most gaming growth by a long shot. We’ve known that games were on the rise for years. Especially since they draw in so much more revenue than apps do. None of it is really surprising, but it’s nice to see a graph of it. Check out the best Android apps, ever!   15 best Android apps of 20177 days ago The big takeaway here is that the apps and games market on mobile has taken hold. It’s not a commentary on how many apps get downloaded. After all, reports show that those numbers are going down in developed markets. What it does say is that the apps that people have chosen to use are ones they now use instead of previous methods in the past. We use apps to check our bank accounts, talk to people, navigate, and be productive more now than we did last year or the year before. For now, there is nothing to indicate that those trends are changing anytime soon.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 93 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares197 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. LondonLeedsFan Absolutely. Release a product, sell it at full price, and provide us with a limited, half-baked and delayed service. Thanks Google! xyz First of all, you should know that no one gives a shit about your feelings. Anyway, nothing funnier than people who are ignorant about everything outside their borders lecturing people on their country's law and regulations. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? LondonLeedsFan Mate, if you want Downton Abbey, you're more than welcome to it! ;) Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english? Lars Jeppesen Yes, language is US English, also on my phone LondonLeedsFan We don't even have podcasts on Play Music yet in the UK. Tiuri Elvander For some reason I just got them this weekend. Go to the Play Music website and log out and log in again. Maybe if you have a secondary google account, try that and then return to your main account. I logged in using my dad's account and then when I logged in using my own account again, I got the new look (mid 2016 look) Play Music, including podcasts! Srujan Probably for those panicking over losing healthcare protection on their pre-existing conditions. ericshmerick We get it, you don't like him. Your post is wholly inaccurate by the way. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing. I must share with you a job wherein all of tools is actually alloted to you and also it is a relatively easy in addition to really easy work. Not necessary to build your personal website domains and many more., all will be presented to you 100% free. Visitors definitely will browse the landing page so you are going to get compensated for that. Its as simple as that. I'm getting big profits from home from this work exactly like $20000 every month and sometimes more and if you also actually want to get paid same as that then follow these particular not very difficult directions by looking at this homepage .... ➤➤➤http:[email protected] .. Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! Jack Smith Wow! Thanks. Never realized you could do this. 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd. Paul Quinn I debated on that. I think I prefer the ominous nature of it. Reminds me of THE Borg. xyz It's appropriate because now Google can listen to everything you say at home. Nick Riviera It works terribly, like quite a few new services. Amit Interesting. No such issues for me. I haven't found home to falter even once, from what I asked for... el conejo Don't worry I'll place a logic bomb called "America Only" and that sh*t will blow up your network trafficking toolkit Paul Quinn We've updated the article because some of you are able to get this to work outside the US. Thanks for that info! Zsolt V How about checking first before spreading FUD? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. CD RW can't wait to have my nightly ASMR from Google Badouken I've been using this when reading, it makes for a relaxing read. surethom Does not work here in the UK. Unless u have to pay for subscription which I don't. Blake Sinnett They need to add this. https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA Paul Quinn Totally! Tell your Home.... Say, "Hey Google, I want to give feedback." Jack Smith Are you not the author? Are you not suppose to know the device? The poster can do this on the GH no problem and should that not be the answer? Jack Smith You can use it and I do similar with others. Just ask your GH to play it. Most nights we listen say at bedtime "hey google play 10 hours of thunderstorms" and it plays it from YouTube. But thanks for sharing because this is what I will use this evening for sure. Hope the wife does not mind. Jack Smith Love the ambient sounds built-in. But my preference right now is the 10 hours of thunderstorms with flutes from YouTube. Highly recommend. The problem with the others is they do not last long enough. Jack Smith Well re-reading article I am a dork. Never thought to ask for a time period with the built-in white noise. Jack Smith This is not a US only thing you just can play ambient or white noise from YouTube and we do it all the time. Tons more selection and some really good ones. But I really wish the author would know the GH better and share such things. Everytime he writes on the GH drives me nuts as pretty much every time there is incorrect information or something misleading or key points missing and has to be cleaned up in the comments area. Why? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information. The difference here (and the point of the article) was that the GH has this feature built in and includes the ability to set a timer with it. The GH has always been able to play audio tracks of any kind. I guess I could have mentioned this alternate means of playing ambient sound in a sentence. Thanks for the feedback! I am new to this so it all just fine tunes my writing! Cory S If you tell it to play it to a chromecast, they appear to just be existing youtube videos.

Google works to protect Gmail users against phishing attacks, and has explained how its systems work. “Every day, millions of phishing emails are blocked from reaching your inbox,” said Google. “We protect our users from phishing attacks in a number of ways.” Using machine learning-based detection of spam and phishing messages, which has contributed to 99.9% accuracy in spam detection. Providing Safe Browsing warnings about dangerous links, within Gmail and across more than 2 billion browsers. Preventing suspicious account sign-ins through dynamic, risk-based challenges. Scanning email attachments for malware and other dangerous payloads. “In addition, we’re taking multiple steps to combat this type of attack in the future,” said Google. This includes updating its policies and enforcement on OAuth applications, updating its anti-spam systems to prevent phishing campaigns, and augmenting monitoring of suspicious third-party apps that request information from users.

It all started, as many YouTube controversies usually do, with PewDiePie, YouTube’s biggest star and arguably one of the most divisive on the platform. The swede who championed the Let’s Play and built it into a multi-million dollar empire has always considered himself untouchable, thanks to his staggering subscriber count and legions of dedicated fans. But back in February, PewDiePie forgot that making terrible jokes about the Holocaust might not go down too well and inadvertently caused a flight of large ad buys from big brands from YouTube. This relatively small furore has since caused a butterfly effect of sorts as YouTube pre-empts brand flight to other platforms by introducing a LONG overdue system of brand safety controls and guidelines. This granular system allows advertisers to restrict their buys to content producers that fit their needs – less sex, violence, drugs, swearing etc – the stuff that tends to get them in trouble when they flirt with it. This isn’t a new concept for advertising – TV, Radio, Film and Newspaper ad buys are always related to strict content guidelines. YouTube creators have been lucky up until now as there has been little controversy over videos and their links to the ads that run on them. If you see a Nike or Telstra ad on a video, you are probably not likely to link that to content. But as brands begin aligning themselves with social or political causes, their customers are now boycotting or re-aligning their buying patterns to match. A channel that features someone discussing their intense dislike of a race or features “pranks” involving throwing milkshakes at fast food drive through workers might not align well with a brand. The impact of these changes has been swift and brutal to many traditional creators, with most of them detecting a heavy hit to revenue based on current and previous videos being refused monetisation. In many cases, this might just be YouTube’s conservative algorithms assuming the worst, but in others it’s doing something many had expected was coming for a long time – moderating content in the same way traditional media has had to fit advertising guidelines. But the anger that perpetuates the YouTube bubble seems to misunderstand where their money stems from. For many creators, the money Google pays them is “Youtube” or “Google” money. Like those who think their meat is made by the supermarket, too many creators are unaware that marketing budgets pay for their livelihoods. There is no room for anger here – if an advertiser doesn’t like what you are putting out, they won’t pay for it. In the same way commercial TV and radio lose advertisers based on poor or unsuitable content, so now is online video. If you are beholden to a platform – whether it be a completely vertical one like YouTube, a network like Machinima, or a standalone ad network like Tribal – you must play by its rules to reap the spoils. For many with established audiences, Patreon is the new black, as users themselves put up their dollars for the content they want. Popular critic Jim Sterling has long championed the system to fund his content, and many other YouTubers make significantly more money from that platform than they do via Google. Users pay a couple of dollars per video and creators demonetise their videos completely, removing ads for all. YouTube Red customers also contribute ad-free dollars for each video they consume, with revenue drawing from their monthly subscription. On top of this, there are many, usually undisclosed, deals and agreements running in the background of many popular YouTube channels – from extra CPM to promote a game positively, to native product placement and themes around brands. Even innocent product reviews or unboxings are generally sponsored with very little declaration – these deals are where the real money lies. There is no room for complaints here. YouTube’s contract with its creators stems from the staggering amount of free services they offer – hosting, promotion, editing, analytics, organisation – with monetisation being the cherry on top. Few other networks offer these functions for free, and even fewer offer revenue sharing programs. As a comparison, Google Adwords offers significantly lower CPM for websites than it does for videos, and outside of banner placement it does not offer sites any sort of hosting or promotional tools. As someone who ran a moderately successful independent games site for several years, I can assure you I did not get anywhere near the revenue from 1 million unique views than I would have if my site was a video (and we had several ad networks running). Relying on a platform for revenue is tough – many users ran similar gauntlets with eBay and Facebook, investing heavily in developing businesses using their tools before they were hit with the same commercial realities around changing methods of access and global competition. YouTube had a long gold rush, but there was always going to be a time that the mines eventually ran dry.

(Oliver Morrison/The Wichita Eagle via AP) PITTSBURG, Kan. — The week after Amy Robertson had been hired as the new principal at Pittsburg High School, Emily Smith, the journalism teacher there, gathered her student editors and a couple of other writers who were hanging around, took them into a back room and shut the door. The Wichita Eagle reports that while trying to research Robertson for a profile story, one of the students had found some problems with her background. The student had looked Robertson up on Google and found that her education consulting firm in Dubai appeared to have been reported for violations. Then Smith looked up the name of the university Robertson said she had attended, Collins. Smith’s son is named Collin, so she wasn’t likely to get it wrong, and she wrote down the college’s name twice. But when Smith Googled the university, nothing came up; it appeared as if the university didn’t exist. She thought she might be going crazy. So she set up a meeting with school superintendent Destry Brown. To her relief, Brown said that the university Robertson had attended was actually called Corlinns. But Brown said he would help the students set up a Skype interview with Robertson, who was still living in Dubai, so they could have her clear up any confusion. However, a quick search of Corlinns University that night revealed articles that characterized it as a diploma mill. So during study hall, Smith took those six students, handed out stapled packets containing the information discovered so far and told them they had to decide what they wanted to do about it. She walked out of the room and let them discuss their options. Connor Balthazor was not an editor, he just happened to be around when Smith needed another writer. This felt like a big responsibility. “She trusted me to be a part of that process,” Balthazor remembers thinking. “I didn’t want to let her down or any of the other five writers down.” When Smith returned to the room, the students had come to a decision: This is important, and we have to write something about this, they told her. Their decision that day would change each of their young lives in dramatic fashion, throwing them into the national spotlight and earning them an invitation to the White House Correspondents Dinner. But it was a decision Smith had been preparing students to make for the past seven years. When Smith was told to teach journalism seven years ago, she said, she had to start from scratch — her students didn’t know the difference between a caption and a lede. And she didn’t have much experience with serious journalism: She had edited the tiny school paper in Arma, a town of 1,500, and took a few classes in college. But if she was going to do it, she said, she was going give it 110 percent. She separated the yearbook and journalism students into separate class periods and later added separate photography classes. It’s not uncommon for Smith to have several students working independently every period. Often there is only one chance to take certain classes, like AP government, at Pittsburg High, so she lets students come to her when they can. When the students need to interview someone, they just go and conduct the interview. They know not to disrupt other classrooms. Smith has set her class up in a way that can look chaotic. But it’s an expression of her belief in how to help her students learn. “One thing I’ve always done (is) I treat my kids like young adults, especially upper-level kids,” Smith said. “I say they are colleagues, they are making the decisions.” And, in turn, the students drop the formalities and just call her “Smith.” She enters the paper, the Booster Redux, into monthly local and regional competitions and takes students to national competitions. The message is clear: In exchange for a degree of freedom, she expects the students to challenge themselves. A few years ago, Smith’s journalists wanted to write about the extreme ways wrestlers were losing weight. That group of students couldn’t deal with the discomfort of digging and tough questions, Smith said, so the story turned into a piece about how hard the wrestlers worked. A couple of years later, a different group of students wrote an investigative piece about the wrestlers. And that wasn’t even the lead story in that issue. The lead story won a national award. It was about boys in the school who were trading nude photos like they were playing cards. Smith finished that issue while she was nine months’ pregnant. Last year, one of her students died in a car accident. The seniors in class were too distraught, Smith said, and didn’t think they could write about it. But the underclassmen thought it was too important to skip and interviewed the dead student’s girlfriend, who was in the car during the accident. That story won second place out of 922 entries at the national high school journalism convention. But the story on Robertson would be the first time they’d turn their critical attention away from exposing their own lives to adults and instead to the adults themselves. The students spent the entire day in Smith’s room researching and preparing questions for their Skype interview the next day. Robertson had e-mailed them materials from her educational consulting company. But the students did a reverse image search, and the pictures appeared to have been pulled from random websites. The language in one of her brochures had been plagiarized. Robertson had sent the students a document in which the names of the schools she worked at had been redacted. But because it was a Microsoft Word document, the students could easily remove the parts that had been blacked out. They looked up the schools, and they didn’t appear to exist. When they shared what they had learned with Brown, the superintendent, he told them everything would be fine once they Skyped with Robertson. The next day, they got nervous as the importance of what they were about to do sank in. “We weren’t sure what to expect; we’d never done anything like this before,” Balthazor said. They had prepared a detailed script, with who would be asking each question. Maddie Baden would start the interview, because she was the one who had been e-mailing with Robertson. Then they got a curveball. The morning of the interview, the superintendent said he would ask the questions. They could ask some follow-up questions. But the script they had prepared was worthless. Brown was concerned about what the students had told him, but he didn’t think he could legally start talking with them about personnel issues. To the students, it felt as if he were brushing them off and dismissing their concerns. When Brown went back to his office after their meeting, he verified that, indeed, Robertson had plagiarized her pamphlet. When Brown called Robertson, she didn’t want to do the interview with the students. “What am I supposed to tell them?” Brown said she asked him. “The truth would be really nice, because they think you are lying, and I have some questions, too,” Brown said he told her. But to appease her concerns, he agreed to sit in on the interview. He said he was worried about the kids. He didn’t want them to be put in a confrontational position with their new principal. And he didn’t want to start off on the wrong foot with his new principal. “No matter what side of the fence you’re on, your britches are probably caught in the barbed wire,” Brown said of his predicament. Robertson rambled for most of the interview, and the students didn’t have a chance to ask any of their questions. After about 15 minutes, Smith — who was sitting behind the students - started making a chopping motion with her hands. She was trying to get them to “cut in.” But only one of the students could see her directly. So Smith started stomping her feet to get their attention. At one point, Robertson said she had been living in Spain, with an apartment in New York, and regularly flew to California to attend her graduate classes. The students were looking at each other with raised eyebrows and exchanging messages in a chat group on their computers. They kept egging each other on to cut in. Balthazor was nervous. Robertson wouldn’t stop talking, so he would have to interrupt her. It felt as if he would really be sticking his neck out there. But the cavalier way she talked about flying from Spain to California to attend class made him mad. “It was insulting to figure she could say that and not have any repercussions and not have anyone push harder,” he said. So finally he asked her “How is that fiscally responsible?” Each student interrupted, and by the end, Brown said, he was just sitting back as the students pressed for more answers. After the interview, Brown told the students he hoped they had all the answers they needed. Brown seemed upset at how hard the students had been on Robertson, several of them said. Brown told them no employee he had ever hired had ever sat through something like that before. She is going to be the next principal, he told them. Later that day, he told the students that he hoped they would write a nice piece welcoming Robertson to the community. Balthazor understood that Brown had to defend his employee, but it also bothered Balthazor that Brown seemed to be taking sides. They were just high school students. It was difficult to trust their own work over the word of their future principal, who said they were wrong, and over their own superintendent, who was standing by her. “Ultimately we decided we have to go with what we found,” Balthazor said. “That was a major growing point for everybody. . We pushed past her essentially saying we were wrong.” But their work would have to largely be put on hold: It was the start of spring break, and several of them had trips planned to Disney World and Myrtle Beach. When the students returned from break, they got another surprise: Smith told them she couldn’t help any longer. She had been in touch with Eric Thomas, the director of Kansas Scholastic Press Association, who recommended that she recuse herself from the story. Smith had been part of the first round of the hiring committee, which was a conflict of interest. So she brought in Andra Stefanoni, a local freelance reporter. Stefanoni was the mother of a Pittsburg student, so most of the student journalists either knew her or knew of her. But Stefanoni and Thomas only had a few days to guide the students to their print deadline on Thursday. And on Tuesday afternoon, their shared Google document was largely filled with “xxxx” and “???” in place of information they still hadn’t verified. They had to focus and decided to narrow in on Robertson’s education credentials, because they felt as if that was easier to pin down than the questions about her work experience. If they didn’t get a response by e-mail, Stefanoni told them, they couldn’t give up. They had to get on the phone, even if they were scared. One evening after Baden came home from dance practice, she told her parents the full story about what she was working on. They told her they were worried it could come back to hurt her when the new principal arrived. When Baden showed up at school the next day, Smith could tell how nervous she and the others were. “It’s not always easy to do the right thing or popular to do the right thing,” Smith told them. “You guys have uncovered some information that is rock solid. You can change your mind, but you are the ones that have to make the decision. You are the ones who have to choose to go forward.” Smith, now in the role of cheerleader, tried to get them to think seriously about what could happen. They were all so well-behaved and hard-working, she said, pointing to their school IDs — they were some of the only students still wearing the IDs, like they were supposed to, she said. “You follow every rule — what could you possibly be faulted for? It’s not like you walk the line. What are you going to be faulted for? You walk away from the line.” Smith, who has two young children, was worried about her own job as well, but she tried not to show it. “In a battle, you don’t want the general being ‘I don’t think we’re going to win,’” Smith said. “Part of my job is to make them feel supported and confident.” Even Stefanoni was worried. She relies on her relationships to get jobs as a freelancer and didn’t want to cause trouble for her son. Trina Paul, one of the six students, had felt nervous during tennis matches and forensic tournaments, but in those instances, she was nervous just for herself. Now what they were doing would reverberate throughout the community. Smith told them it was their choice. They had to be the ones to decide whether to go forward. “But I just thought if we found all this and we feel that something is there, we should go forward,” Baden said. By Wednesday afternoon, “it looked bleak,” Stefanoni remembered. “They had super-busy schedules, very little free time and lots left to do before deadline.” One student had to try on a prom dress, another had to baby-sit after school, and a third had softball practice. But they arranged a video chat that night. Thomas of the Scholastic Press Association helped them think about how to start the piece. Baden’s father wondered what boy’s voice he was hearing coming from her room that late at night. On Thursday, they continued to work remotely, during their free class periods and after school, as they had done all week. Thomas would offer advice to one student, who would then hand the phone to another student. They were rewriting each other’s sentences. Because of their busy schedules that week, Stefanoni would often be at the grocery store or cooking dinner and receive an alert that a student had made a correction. The school paper was printed by and inserted into the local paper, the Morning Sun, so they couldn’t delay any longer. Smith didn’t see the final story until right before it was pasted onto the front page. “I felt very relieved slash scared,” Baden said. “What’s the community think? What will the superintendent think? What is Amy Robertson gonna think?” “I was confident in the content we had produced,” said Gina Mathew. “I was most afraid that nothing was going to change.” When Balthazor walked through the front doors of the school on Friday, he saw one of his friends reading the paper. “Hold on, I’m not finished reading it yet,” his friend told him. Several other reporters were decorating for prom and received messages that the school was buzzing about their story. But just as the students were getting dressed for prom on Saturday, the local paper published an article headlined “Brown refutes claims in school paper — Superintendent maintains new principal highly qualified, best candidate.” Then, the next day, the school board called a special meeting for Tuesday. It appeared as if the school board might stand by Robertson even after their article was published, Smith thought. On Tuesday, Brown called a faculty meeting at the high school, before the school board meeting. Before spring break, they had held another faculty meeting in which several teachers said Brown had criticized the faculty for undermining the new principal. “I shouldn’t be so concerned about doing the right thing,” Smith said. “But that’s the reality of the world we live in. You might be doing what’s right, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to end well.” Smith asked two of the students who worked on the article to hang around after school: If she was going to be fired, she wanted reinforcements nearby to help rally the troops. So Mathew and Paul snooped around, trying to find a place where they might be able to listen. After the teachers left the meeting, Mathew heard it first: Robertson had resigned. “I was shocked,” Mathew said. “I don’t think I really comprehended what the possibilities were or outcomes could be, to hear it be so final.” Although publicly he still supported Robertson, behind the scenes, Brown had started to feel the pressure. On Sunday, he demanded that Robertson produce her undergraduate diploma from the University of Tulsa by Tuesday or she would be fired. Robertson told Brown it was all a big misunderstanding and she would talk to the university to get everything straightened out. “She always had a good reason, a good excuse,” Brown said. In the first round of her interviews, 22 of the 24 hiring committee members had given her the highest marks for the quality of her answers. She had sent Brown unofficial transcripts that had official-looking seals. But on Monday, when Brown called the University of Tulsa, he was told that Robertson had never contacted them and that the transcript she had provided him did not come from them. “I feel a sense of I let people down,” Brown said. “In 33 years, I’ve not had something like this. “You just feel like you do what is right and try to do right by people and something like this happens and you get duped. No matter how hard you try to do right, sometimes doing right isn’t right. Or maybe what you thought you were doing right wasn’t right.” At the end of the school board meeting on Tuesday night, Brad Bourbina, a parent, stood up. “Wait a minute,” Bourbina told them as the meeting adjourned. “These young people just did the job that you already should have done and they came here with the expectation of at least getting a little bit of information about what happened and why.” Most of the meeting had been spent in executive session after the board announced Robertson’s resignation. The board’s brief statement at the end of the meeting didn’t clear up what had gone wrong, he said, nor acknowledge the hard work of the six journalists. When Smith showed up at school the next day, the secretary told her she had messages from several national publications and from Duke University inviting her journalists to apply. The six journalists went to first-period classes but spent the rest of the day answering calls from reporters who wanted to know more about how these Davids had managed to slay Goliath. They did interviews for CBS and “Good Morning America,” the Washington Post and the New York Times. Although they didn’t predict it in advance, several of the students think they know why their work resonated across the country. “In the era of Trump, it kind of stood out. A lot of journalists have been receiving a lot of heat for not reporting on him the proper way,” said Paul. “A lot of people view this as we’re holding people in power accountable for telling the truth.” They continued to receive e-mails and packages in the mail for weeks afterward and were invited by the Huffington Post to be special guests at the White House Correspondents Dinner. Brown brought pizza and tried to make amends with the students as the interview requests poured in. He thanked the students for speeding up the process of discovering Robertson’s duplicity. But Brown said he remains confident that even if they had not, when Robertson showed up, “the house of cards would have fallen.” Brown was surprised to receive e-mails from people across the world who had been deceived by Robertson before, he said. But he was even more surprised by hateful messages he has received. “I guess people felt like I had broken their trust or that I had put kids at risk or something, I’m not sure,” Brown said. “Most of (the messages) I received would probably not be repeatable in the news. Most of them had to do with my stupidity, that I am an embarrassment to Pittsburg and the board needs to get rid of me.” Although they will be recognized for their perseverance, Balthazor says he will always remember how, even as Brown tried to shield them from the dangers of the adult world, Smith pushed them to take responsibility for it. “She’s probably the best teacher I’ve ever had,” Balthazor said. “Simply from a human being perspective. She has incredible moral integrity.” “You are fighting the good fight; you’re doing the right thing by doing this,” she told them 20 times a day, he said. “This is some of the most important work you’ll ever do.” “And she was right.” Advertisement Most Popular News Sun, 05/07/2017 - 18:04 Motorcycle crash in Douglas County kills Lawrence man, 45 News Sun, 05/07/2017 - 22:23 6-year-old girl remains in critical condition Sunday after being pulled from Topeka hotel pool News Sun, 05/07/2017 - 18:29 36-year-old Topeka man injured after crashing into grain silo in Rossville News Sun, 05/07/2017 - 17:23 Sabetha man killed in early-morning crash Sunday on US-75 highway   View all Local Store Sales » Advertisement More Mon, 05/08/2017 - 00:01 Topeka pets needing a home: Meet Bentley and Patches Sun, 05/07/2017 - 23:43 Topeka Performing Arts Center announces family-friendly comedy show this fall Sun, 05/07/2017 - 23:06 Former students of North Topeka’s Curtis Junior High gather again to keep memories alive Sun, 05/07/2017 - 23:21 Topeka Police calls - May 7, 2017 update The following persons were booked into the Shawnee County jail in connection to felonies: Read more Load more Around the Web   Privacy Policy Terms of Service Copyright Notice Contact Us The Topeka Capital-Journal © 2017.

Noah Buhayar Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett waves to shareholders at the company-owned Borsheims jewellery store in Omaha on Sunday. Photo: AP Seattle: Underlying the festivities at Warren Buffett’s annual bash for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders over the weekend was a sobering fact: Finding the next big thing is hard. The Berkshire chief executive officer spoke at length on Saturday about his failure to pounce on opportunities in tech stocks, the challenge of lining up large deals, and his frustration with a cash pile that’s approaching $100 billion. “We shouldn’t use your money that way for long periods,” Buffett said of the cash during his meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “The question is, ‘Are we going to be able to deploy it?’ I would say that history is on our side, but it’d be more fun if the phone would ring.” It was a notably downbeat moment for the billionaire, who’s spent the past five decades snapping up businesses and stocks. His investments transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile maker into a conglomerate with insurance companies, manufacturers, retailers, utilities and a railroad, as well as an equity portfolio valued at $135 billion. With thousands of adoring fans watching live (and many more streaming video online), Buffett and vice chairman Charles Munger took questions for five hours from the audience, analysts and journalists on topics from investing to public policy. Buffett, 86, said the Republican health plan that cleared the House of Representatives was sure to help the wealthy, and the billionaire reiterated his view that society needs to do more to help people he called “roadkill” because they get left behind by capitalism. The Berkshire CEO also took another swing at hedge funds. Most of all, the billionaire expounded on his company and investments. Buffett said Wells Fargo & Co. mishandled its response to a fake-account scandal. And he predicted that Berkshire could make “a fair amount” on its recent airline investments if carriers keep a stronger grip on fares, while acknowledging “it is no cinch.” Apple, IBM For years, Buffett and Munger have told investors that the company’s size would be an anchor dragging down performance, only to defy their own predictions. But some missteps are now underscoring their warning. Buffett recently scaled back an investment in International Business Machines Corp. and said that he was too optimistic about the company’s prospects in 2011. Berkshire has been piling into Apple Inc. in its latest technology bet. The moves prompted a broader discussion about whether Berkshire had dropped the ball in a sector that’s come to dominate the ranks of the world’s largest businesses. For most of his career, Buffett avoided technology stocks, saying the companies were outside his expertise. On Saturday, however, he issued a mea culpa for being too late to spot their potential. Companies like Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. don’t require the large sums of capital that were required to sustain the giant industrial firms of an earlier era, Buffett said. In hindsight, he said he could have been quicker to spot Google’s potential. Berkshire’s auto insurer Geico was an early customer of the search-engine firm, and its founders consulted him around the time they were taking the company public. ‘I blew it’ “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” Buffett said his analysis on Apple differed from IBM, in part because the iPhone maker is more of a consumer-products company. Munger said the Apple investment was a good sign. “Either you’ve gone crazy or you’re learning,” the vice chairman told Buffett. “I prefer the learning explanation.” Steve Wallman, a money manager based in Middleton, Wisconsin, who’s been attending the meetings for more than three decades, said the remarks illustrated how Buffett and Munger are “fallible, thoughtful, and aware of how much the world has changed.” They went through “a litany of trends they missed, mistakes they made,” Wallman said. “I’ve never seen them exhibit so much vulnerability.” ‘Foot to the floor’ Buffett also expressed frustration on the acquisition front, saying Berkshire hasn’t put its “foot to the floor on anything for, really, a very long time.” The comment prompted an exchange with Munger, who said he thought Berkshire could now entertain deals up to $150 billion. That would represent a giant leap for the conglomerate. Its largest buyout was the 2010 purchase of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for about $34 billion. It’s not for a lack of trying. Buffett said on Saturday that Berkshire and 3G Capital were each prepared to put $15 billion into a bid by their Kraft Heinz Co. for Unilever this year. The offer was pulled after the consumer-goods giant rejected the proposal. David Rolfe, who manages about $6.8 billion including Berkshire shares at Wedgewood Partners, said he wasn’t surprised that Buffett is bummed out by the growing cash pile. Stock markets have been rising for years, making it harder to find attractive investments. ‘Cash problem’ “A run-of-the-mill bear market could certainly solve the cash problem” by offering opportunities for Buffett, Rolfe said. Berkshire gained 2.4% this year, trailing the 7.2% advance of the S&P 500 Index. Buffett’s company said after markets closed Friday that first-quarter operating profit slipped 4.8% to $3.56 billion, as insurance units faced claims from a cyclone in Australia. The stream of earnings is a growing challenge. The company’s next CEO may have to allocate far more capital than Buffett ever did, the billionaire said Saturday. That will involve deciding how much to deploy to Berkshire subsidiaries, takeovers and stock picks while also considering whether to return funds to shareholders. Buffett, who hasn’t publicly identified a successor, doesn’t pay a dividend and rarely repurchases stock, arguing that he can do better by retaining earnings. But investors pressed him about whether the record cash pile would force him to rethink his approach. “At a point, the burden of proof really shifts to us, big time,’’ Buffett said. “There’s no way I can come back here three years from now and tell you that we hold $150 billion or so in cash.’’ Bloomberg Noah Buhayar Topics: Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire CEO Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meet Tech stocks More From Livemint READ MORE The people who will run France after Emmanuel Macron’s win India, Philippines to lead Asian growth as workforces rise: Nomura Some of the best firms have NPAs due to slow decision making: Shobana Kamineni First Published: Mon, May 08 2017. 09 15 AM IST Editor's Picks Making sense of Modinomics Is the ordinance empowering RBI the last act of bad loans resolution?

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Over $2.6 trillion is held as untaxed cash in offshore accounts by top US companies like Apple, Google, IBM, Pfizer Pepsi and Coke, McDonald's etc according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for Tax and Economic Policy (ITEP). This is the highest-ever hoard held offshore by American companies and represents a net tax loss of a staggering $767 billion for the US government. The $2.6 trillion untaxed funds are more than the combined GDP of 153 countries. Meanwhile, the Hudco IPO that opens today will see the government sell 10.19% stake in the firm and raise up to Rs1,200 crore at a price band of Rs 56-60 per share. Here's a look at seven macro-economic triggers that are likely to impact the market today Companies to face MAT on dividend payout, debt recast: Minimum alternate tax, or MAT, a levy on book profit of companies that avail of exemptions and concessions, is now back to haunt companies – both Indian and multinationals operating in the country. Companies that had announced a dividend or restructured debt in the previous financial year will face this liability in the current financial year. This is because, under IndAS, the new Indian accounting standard, both dividend and debt restructuring could increase the book profit of companies and would attract MAT. Of the BSE 500 companies, 422 had announced dividend last year. Path cleared for big private role in defence production: The defence ministry seems to have unlocked the strategic partnership (SP) logjam with a firm push from the Prime Minister's Office and sustained focus by defence minister Arun Jaitley, setting up the private sector to play a major role in the production of weapons systems for the armed forces. A tussle within the bureaucracy over what rules the SP model would follow had resulted in a stalemate within the ministry since February 2016, frustrating leading private sector companies that were expecting to get mega production orders for aircraft, submarines and land systems. Macron wins French presidency by emphatic margin : Emmanuel Macron was elected president of France on Sunday with a business-friendly vision of European integration, defeating Marine Le Pen, a far-right nationalist who threatened to take France out of the European Union, early projections showed. The centrist's emphatic victory, which also smashed the dominance of France's mainstream parties, will bring huge relief to European allies who had feared another populist upheaval to follow Britain's vote to quit the EU and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president. Life insurance portability on anvil? Insurance regulator IRDA is may allow life insurance policy holders to switch from one insurer to another without surrendering their existing policies and thus losing a portion of the premium paid. Discussions to allow portability in life insurance are in early stages and it is likely to happen after the industry moves to a completely digital form of transacting and managing insurance product. Green car plan prioritises electric vehicles over hybrids: The Niti Aayog has recommended lowering taxes and interest rates for loans on electric vehicles, while capping sales of conventional cars, signalling a dramatic shift in policy in one of the world's fastest growing auto markets. A draft of the 90-page blueprint, also suggests the government opens a battery plant by the end of 2018 and uses tax revenues from the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles to set up charging stations for electric vehicles. The recommendations are aimed at electrifying all vehicles in the country by 2032 and will likely shape a new mobility policy. Government plans lower income tax slab for single women: Acknowledging that women are a disadvantaged section despite comprising nearly half of the population of the country, the Centre is considering lowering income tax for single women, introducing Aadhaar-linked health cards for free basic health check-ups for women and cashless medical service for those who are pregnant. A national policy for women is expected to be unveiled soon. It proposes a lower rate of income tax for single women as it takes note of a growing segment of the population; there has been a 39% increase in this category between 2001 and 2011. FDI momentum may slow this year: India's FDI inflow momentum may slow down this year and exports too may not revive with "full gusto" as domestic bottlenecks remain, says a report. Although higher world growth is likely to buoy exports, a strengthening rupee and worsening domestic bottlenecks could limit the increase, it said. "Stronger exports and higher FDI inflows have likely contributed to the strong performance of the INR is recent times. While both are likely to remain buoyant, we believe it is important to note that incremental gains over the short term may not be limitless," HSBC said in a research note. ... and in financial markets last Friday Rupee down: The rupee closed at 64.37 a dollar—a level last seen on 24 April, down 0.31%, its steepest fall since 10 April, from its Thursday’s close of 64.17. Bonds rebound: Government bonds (G-Secs) rebounded on good buying support from banks and corporates.

The 6.79% G-Secs maturing in 2029 climbed to Rs 97.39 from Rs 97.1350, while its yield softened to 7.11% from 7.14%. The 7.59% G-Secs maturing in 2026 gained to Rs 103.6325 from Rs 103.40, while its yield moved down to 7.02% from 7.06%.

For Minori Takechi, founder of Vinclu Inc., that's a missed opportunity. Takechi is the creator of Hikari Azuma, a miniskirt-wearing avatar. She can hold a basic conversation and wake you up in the morning by turning on the lights. Hikari will message you at work and greet you when you return home. She'll also set you back about $2,700. Minori Takechi interacts with the Gatebox character. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg While Amazon.com Inc. and Google are barreling ahead with efforts to get voice-operated speaker assistants into consumers' homes,  Takechi says these products are too focused on delivering utility. Instead, his Tokyo-based  startup is betting that people will want to forge an emotional relationship with a digital assistant. "My vision is a world where people can share their daily lives with their favorite fictional characters," Takechi, 29, said. "We live in a time when all kinds of robots start making their way into our homes. But much of what you see now is inorganic and mechanical and I doubt people will want to communicate with something like that." Hikari lives in a coffee maker-sized glass cylinder called Gatebox, as a hologram-like projection on a screen. She doesn't mind flirting. Say that you like her and Hikari will chirp back with "today, tomorrow and the day after!" In its current form, Gatebox's appeal may be limited to Japan, which has earned a (somewhat over-hyped) reputation for being a place where unmarried men would rather develop a relationship with a virtual girlfriend. The good news is that the company plans to offer a variety of avatars, which could be anything from cartoon characters to sports heroes. Azuma Hikari, the first character for the Gatebox virtual home robot. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg Vinclu isn't the only company betting that emotion will have to be a key ingredient for a robotic or AI companion. Groove X Inc., another Japanese startup, is working on a robot that "touches your heart." When Takechi set out to raise money in early 2015, before Amazon's Echo started to gain traction and Google Home debuted, most investors weren’t keen on backing a hardware project, he said. Still, he was able to raise an initial 20 million yen ($180,000) based on conceptual sketches. One early fan was Taizo Son, the younger brother of SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son. So far, Vinclu has raised about 200 million yen from investors including Primal Capital and Incubate Fund. Line Corp., Japan's biggest instant messaging company, bought a majority stake in the startup in March as part of its push into AI.  "Combining Gatebox know-how and technology with our own Clova AI platform will allow us to develop a new kind of post-display, post-touch agent capable of making the lives of the users richer and more fun," said Jun Masuda, Line's chief strategy and marketing officer. The company is planning to launch its own tabletop speaker called Wave in early summer. Gatebox is still a long way from offering real companionship, and its repertoire is limited to just a handful of scripted interactions. But Line's backing will give Takechi access to richer AI capabilities and an ecosystem of services that go far beyond messaging. More than 171 million subscribers in Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia use Line to read the news, hail taxi rides and find part-time jobs.  Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

Although Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri give the impression they can answer anything, in reality that kind of general AI is still years away, according to Benedict Evans, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. He warned in March that there's a limit to how many voice commands people can memorize and that some may end up having negative emotional responses to things that seem almost human, but aren't quite. Minori Takechi. Photographer: Ko Sasaki/Bloomberg Vinclu's answer to the limitations of voice is kawaii, the Japanese word for cute. Takechi said the company is developing behavior patterns that will let their characters make mistakes without getting on your nerves. The bet is that when a virtual girlfriend fails to order an Uber, you're more likely to forgive her than a disembodied voice from a cylinder. Takechi's formative experience was in the sub-Saharan nation of Malawi, where he moved at the age of 10 when his mother got a job helping the government fight malaria. Stuck in a town with one traffic light and a school where no one spoke his language, Takechi spent the two years holed up in his room with only Pokemon characters for company. That gave him an understanding of otaku culture and planted the seed for Gatebox, he said. "The kind of communication we are focusing on isn't your typical command-answer relationship," Takechi said. "Kawaii is infallible." For more on the technology that powers AI assistants, check out the Decrypted podcast:    Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Underlying the festivities at Warren Buffett’s annual bash for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholders over the weekend was a sobering fact: Finding the next big thing is hard. The Berkshire chief executive officer spoke at length Saturday about his failure to pounce on opportunities in tech stocks, the challenge of lining up large deals, and his frustration with a cash pile that’s approaching $100 billion. “We shouldn’t use your money that way for long periods,” Buffett said of the cash during his meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “The question is, ‘Are we going to be able to deploy it?’ I would say that history is on our side, but it’d be more fun if the phone would ring.” It was a notably downbeat moment for the billionaire, who’s spent the past five decades snapping up businesses and stocks. His investments transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile maker into a conglomerate with insurance companies, manufacturers, retailers, utilities and a railroad, as well as an equity portfolio valued at $135 billion. With thousands of adoring fans watching live (and many more streaming video online), Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger took questions for five hours from the audience, analysts and journalists on topics from investing to public policy. Buffett, 86, said the Republican health plan that cleared the House of Representatives was sure to help the wealthy, and the billionaire reiterated his view that society needs to do more to help people he called “roadkill” because they get left behind by capitalism. The Berkshire CEO also took another swing at hedge funds. Most of all, the billionaire expounded on his company and investments. Buffett said Wells Fargo & Co. mishandled its response to a fake-account scandal. And he predicted that Berkshire could make “a fair amount” on its recent airline investments if carriers keep a stronger grip on fares, while acknowledging “it is no cinch.” Apple, IBM For years, Buffett and Munger have told investors that the company’s size would be an anchor dragging down performance, only to defy their own predictions. But some missteps are now underscoring their warning. Buffett recently scaled back an investment in International Business Machines Corp. and said that he was too optimistic about the company’s prospects in 2011. Berkshire has been piling into Apple Inc. in its latest technology bet. The moves prompted a broader discussion about whether Berkshire had dropped the ball in a sector that’s come to dominate the ranks of the world’s largest businesses. For most of his career, Buffett avoided technology stocks, saying the companies were outside his expertise. On Saturday, however, he issued a mea culpa for being too late to spot their potential. Companies like Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. don’t require the large sums of capital that were required to sustain the giant industrial firms of an earlier era, Buffett said. In hindsight, he said he could have been quicker to spot Google’s potential. Berkshire’s auto insurer Geico was an early customer of the search-engine firm, and its founders consulted him around the time they were taking the company public. ‘I Blew It’ “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” Buffett said his analysis on Apple differed from IBM, in part because the iPhone maker is more of a consumer-products company. Munger said the Apple investment was a good sign. “Either you’ve gone crazy or you’re learning,” the vice chairman told Buffett. “I prefer the learning explanation.” Steve Wallman, a money manager based in Middleton, Wisconsin, who’s been attending the meetings for more than three decades, said the remarks illustrated how Buffett and Munger are “fallible, thoughtful, and aware of how much the world has changed.” They went through “a litany of trends they missed, mistakes they made,” Wallman said. “I’ve never seen them exhibit so much vulnerability.” ‘Foot to the Floor’ Buffett also expressed frustration on the acquisition front, saying Berkshire hasn’t put its “foot to the floor on anything for, really, a very long time.” The comment prompted an exchange with Munger, who said he thought Berkshire could now entertain deals up to $150 billion. That would represent a giant leap for the conglomerate. Its largest buyout was the 2010 purchase of railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for about $34 billion. It’s not for a lack of trying. Buffett said Saturday that Berkshire and 3G Capital were each prepared to put $15 billion into a bid by their Kraft Heinz Co. for Unilever this year. The offer was pulled after the consumer-goods giant rejected the proposal. David Rolfe, who manages about $6.8 billion including Berkshire shares at Wedgewood Partners, said he wasn’t surprised that Buffett is bummed out by the growing cash pile. Stock markets have been rising for years, making it harder to find attractive investments. ‘Cash Problem’ “A run-of-the-mill bear market could certainly solve the cash problem” by offering opportunities for Buffett, Rolfe said. Berkshire gained 2.4 percent this year, trailing the 7.2 percent advance of the S&P 500 Index. Buffett’s company said after markets closed Friday that first-quarter operating profit slipped 4.8 percent to $3.56 billion, as insurance units faced claims from a cyclone in Australia. The stream of earnings is a growing challenge. The company’s next CEO may have to allocate far more capital than Buffett ever did, the billionaire said Saturday. That will involve deciding how much to deploy to Berkshire subsidiaries, takeovers and stock picks while also considering whether to return funds to shareholders. Buffett, who hasn’t publicly identified a successor, doesn’t pay a dividend and rarely repurchases stock, arguing that he can do better by retaining earnings. But investors pressed him about whether the record cash pile would force him to rethink his approach. “At a point, the burden of proof really shifts to us, big time,’’ Buffett said. “There’s no way I can come back here three years from now and tell you that we hold $150 billion or so in cash.’’ © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Since none of the companies seem to be reacting, I'll voice out some valid factual points which anyone can Google and find. The first piece I read was one mentioning that Batu MP Tian Chua was worried about "black smoke" coming out of such facilities, affecting the residents surrounding a soon to be established waste to energy plant currently a landfill. At this point, I wonder if any of the MPs talking about this subject have ever had the curiosity during their multiple trips to Europe have ever even talked about this with those in the industry — or at least had the curiosity to ask Malaysian companies with the reputation for building such facilities. Perhaps they can go talk to KNM Group Bhd who was involved in building such plants in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Germany and Vienna. Or maybe JFE Engineering (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, who has been involved in such projects in Japan since 1991. Or maybe approach IRIS Corp Bhd who have built two such plants in Phuket and Bangkok in Thailand. In fact, if incinerators were so bad, perhaps you can ask how JFE has been building such for Perodua to handle their paint sludge in Rawang since 2001, or GS Paper for their waste in Kuala Langat since 2003, and their latest hazardous waste incinerator located in Kuching and in operation since 2014. And then, a letter recently by one Tajuddin Ramlee raised the spectre of health issues that may appear due to incinerators and its effects on four schools in his neighbourhood. To answer En Tajuddin, the reason why there has been no feedback session, is because the project has yet to be awarded. No company has been granted the contract to build the waste to energy plant by the ministry involved. Until then, there will be no public feedback session. But allow me to write what I've learnt from reading some facts on this issue. First off, there is a need to differentiate between incinerators and waste to energy plants. The latter has intensive regulations and technology implemented with regards to air quality when compared to the former. Waste to energy plants, such as which is planned in Kepong, are commonplace in multiple countries around the globe and has been safely established for some time. Singapore in May 2016 approved a US$473 million (RM2.05 billion) loan for a period of 27 years to establish such a waste to energy power plant which will process 3,600 tonnes of waste while generating 120MW of power for their nation. You can find this news here. In 2013, Sweden ran out of trash and imported 800,000 tonnes of it to generate energy. Northern Europe — including Germany and Austria, also does the same. Also, please note that Malaysian companies have been involved in building these since 1991, and therefore we do have experience in this field for over 26 years — add another 4 years and it will be an entire generation. Should one go to Paris, you could find an underground waste to energy plant 350 metres away from the office of Microsoft France, right next to the River Seine — which was in operation since December 2007 at the price of €580 mil to process 460,000 tonnes of trash. In Charles Montgomery's book Happy City which discusses transforming lives through urban design, he even details designs of waste to energy plants which will become ski slopes, and even one with the piston in the smokestack which will produce an 'O' ring to signal a tonne of carbon dioxide being pumped into the sky of Copenhagen. And this is yet another fallacy that must be addressed — the power plant does not expound toxic gas. It lets out CO2 and water, while everything else is filtered out. You can find details of this in the Best Available Technology (BAT) report published by the Department of Environment with the cooperation  and in consultation of Universiti Malaya (UM), the Malaysia German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and relevant industries and stakeholders. Critics argue that the ash is toxic and therefore should be feared, but at the same time insist on recycling as the only option. This is wrong, because waste to energy plants are not a replacement for recycling. Instead, it is complementary technology. Waste to energy plants are often complemented with recycling initiatives to ensure that recycling takes priority. Waste to energy plants are instead a replacement for landfills, case in point the one in Kepong. It is not the plant which will spew black smoke as that misguided lawmaker and his entire political coalition points out to the level of putting it into their Kuala Lumpur manifesto. A waste to energy plant is supposed to stop us from using plots of land to dump trash and stink up entire areas while releasing methane into the atmosphere and risking whatever pollutants from seeping into the earth and polluting our groundwater supply and subsequently the water tables. Now, having said all this, understand that what is being advocated in Kepong and even by the Selangor government is a solution against having garbage trucks filling up plots of land with trash. Recycling will reduce that amount. Reusing will also reduce the amount. But it only reduces the amount of waste, not by much if we see our national goals in terms of recycling. No country has a total dependency on recycling as a solution for waste management as of yet and in fact, using trash in a waste to energy plant is considered renewable energy and recycling in certain European countries. So, now I have to ask this — what exactly is the fear? If you fear the technology, then the BAT report with UM and GTZ as consultants, shows it can be safe. If you fear the companies implementing it do not have the experience, well, we do have Malaysian engineering companies with 26 years experience in this field in Thailand, Germany, Japan, Austria and even Switzerland. The truth is this, Malaysians don’t trust the government, don’t trust their own companies, and don’t even bother to read up and would rather listen to fear mongering groups who go about with support of politicians who know nuts even after being to Europe multiple times and never had the curiosity to bother asking about this topic until they were nudged in the wrong direction. Frankly speaking, the British, the Europeans, the Koreans, the Australians, the Thais and even the Singaporeans, have decided to burn trash to produce energy with environmental safeguards squarely in place for so long, and to say we shouldn't do the same based on misinformation and irrational fear is downright tragic for a nation of supposed progressives such as ours. * This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail Online.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week The simple solution to reduce congestion from Friday prayers — Aliah Ali Have the consumers been short-changed? — SM Mohamed Idris Waste to energy plants are safe, but the problem is trust — Hafidz Baharom Empowering, liberating citizens via Internet — Jahaberdeen Mohamed Yunoos Stop cyberbullying now! — Sin Chew Daily Military ranks earned, not reward for political or public celebrity — Lt-Col (ret) Mohd Idris Hassan Federal Court restores judicial power — G25 So, who's stupid now? — Tay Tian Yan Ahok’s downfall may have been self-inflicted — Ferooze Ali PEMANDU: It’s about effectiveness, not about size — Ku Kok Peng Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Sharapova remains tight-lipped over Bouchard comments Reuters Video: North Korea detains another American citizen, KCNA reports Reuters Video: Macron storms to victory in French election Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles Not enough investment in green energy, firm finds Sun setting on Japan’s solar energy boom Clean energy to take bigger share of electricity market by 2030 Late profit taking drags Bursa lower Warm countries launch Sun-energy alliance Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The world has considerably changed in so many ways in the past 100 years beyond human imagination, especially in terms of empowering the citizen. To me, citizen empowerment, by which I mean the ability of the citizen to take charge of his life and his destiny individually and collectively, depends largely on attitude, education, access to facts and information and quality of communication technology. Attitude, of course is almost a dominant factor that influences a person’s quality of life in the broadest sense of the word. As the saying goes, “giving flowers to monkeys”, the best of technology is useless in the hands of a community which has a regressive or negative attitude towards life. That aside, the quality, availability and accessibility to education directly empowers the citizen. Education has the amazing power of bringing out potentials in individuals who allow it to happen (attitude). I am referring to education in the broadest sense and not to the specific acquisition of skills in school and universities which sadly have been churning out highly “schooled barbarians”. However, this is a separate matter that I have discussed before. The Internet is indeed a great gift of tremendous power to those who know. In this age, anyone who wants to be educated can do so from the laptop in his home provided that he retains the habit of thinking critically, is analytical in approach and courageous enough to depart from so-called norms based on his level of cognitive abilities. The vast amount of facts, information, ideas and thoughts that once upon a time was available to a select few is now available to everyone. It allows one to access different perspectives of life and demonstrates the miracle that diversity of human environment (ethnic, culture, religion, etc) can bring to evolve one closer to humanity. One truly belongs to a global university if one views it that way. Whether it concerns religion, economics, social, politics or anything in life, you have to think and question it. A person who does not want to think and accepts whatever is given or taught to him as the “truth of life” has chosen to enslave himself to ideas that has arisen out of collective conjectures. Such a person is easily manipulated and limited by norms, culture and ethnicity. Because he is so limited, the humanity in him may not fully evolve especially when he is so readily awed by the herd mentality which unthinking masses usually are prone to. I note with total sadness that while the nature of life wants to liberate the individual, the uneducated mind imprisons him as a slave to a few groups of elitist masters in the community. Hence, the Lord-peasant relationship continues even in the most economically advanced countries, what more in a country like ours. The Internet offers alternative perspectives that can liberate the mind. All powerful segments in society — whether political, religious, social and economic — thrive and grow on limiting the availability and quality of information and facts to others. In other words, they will try to monopolise or control information and facts so that they alone can dominate and be powerful. The Internet erodes this power. Imagine about 100 years ago, if you have a conversation with a so-called learned man, it may be a monologue because you may not have the opportunity to verify the facts that he is telling you. However, today, you are able to verify his facts in real time with the Internet to see whether he is indeed a learned man or a charlatan who had obtained a degree or PhD from  some university. Likewise, the speeches and actions of politicians can be verified with other facts and recorded on YouTube for posterity and to determine the consistency of his ideas and so-called struggles for the people. I truly believe that the Internet is a powerful challenge to the religious and political elites because whatever they say can be researched on the Internet. This is very empowering. The quality and development of information technology also determines the strength and quality of the citizen’s power. I understand that in a decade to come, Google lens may be commercialised. It is like a lens that you fix to your eyes to access the Internet. As you talk to someone you not only can access information relating to what he is saying but you can also do a quick check on the person based on information available on the Internet. A translator speaker may also be made available that allows you to speak to anyone who speaks a different language than you, as in the Star Trek movies. With all these technological developments, I believe citizens will be empowered greatly and cross the religious, ethnic and cultural boundaries towards embracing humanity. I want ordinary citizens to be empowered because I have never believed that the current environment allows real talents to be tapped as those with political, economic and social advantages always have the unfair edge. Our society also still suffers from this psychotic illusion of equating accumulation of material wealth with “success”. Hence, the person with material wealth and connections is given a powerful position in society even though he is a true idiot. Like every good thing, I believe there will be a corresponding evil. In the case of citizen empowerment via the Internet, there will be moves to curtail that access and attempts will be made to tamper with the quality of information and facts available on the Internet. There will also be abuses by those who will abuse life, even offline. These are to be expected and the responsible citizen must design ways to protect the ordinary, responsible citizens’ rights of access to the Internet, both quantity and quality-wise. * Jahaberdeen Mohamed Yunoos is a senior lawyer and founder of Rapera, a movement which encourages thinking and compassionate citizens.

Little wonder that another expert suggested that cybersecurity is “by far” the biggest threat to small and medium enterprises. But with results of user education varying dramatically, it never hurts to have another technique to try to get them to use stronger passwords – or to work to secure employees’ home endpoint devices. If nothing else, a concerted effort at improving human defences now will help boost corporate defences to financial cybercrime – which is still keeping banks up at night. As always, reducing the chances of a serious compromise requires a commitment to addressing the basics. China is attempting to address the basics by using regular security checks on IT vendors that are designed to identify vulnerable Internet and networking services early on. They’d be wary of compromises such as a sneaky Gmail phishing attack, which incorporates a fake Google Docs app. That’s a problem given the reliance on cloud-based applications that, a Google executive said, can ease the burden of data protection compliance. Indeed, online platforms require particular vigilance as many warn that a phishing attack or ransomware infection may just be a lead indicator of a broader extortion or fraud attempt. Mac users were being warned about new malware – linked to Russian attackers who recently ported their Windows backdoor program to macOS – that snoops on encrypted connections, while the Xen project was hit with the third highly critical virtual-machine escape bug in 10 months, Intel rolled out a patch to fix a severe vulnerability in some Intel-based business computers, and Android got security patches for over 100 vulnerabilities affecting a range of components. Search engine Shodan took a new approach to botnet management, launching a service that enables security researchers and law enforcement officers to look for malware command-and-control servers. It’s a notable step forward that could help improve the response to new malware families. Security practitioners are still suffering threat alert fatigue, while employers are suffering their own form of fatigue as they try to derive meaning from the range of cybersecurity credentials in the market. This, as experts warned about tightening controls on third-party access and remaining extra vigilant when choosing the right cybersecurity products in the face of often dubious claims by cybersecurity product vendors. Read more Attack, detection metrics improve but security specialists warn against complacency Meanwhile, criminals are continuing to explore new methods for financial exploitation, with fraudulent gift cards becoming increasingly popular. Another group was abusing the Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure to facilitate financial crimes, while others were notching up their success in compromising government agencies with a Frankenstein malware framework built from a range of publicly available tools. Others are sticking to old favourites, with the average ransomware demand now past $US1000 ($A1320). New technologies were causing other problems, too: India’s Supreme Court, for one, was hearing a challenge to a biometric authentication system that forces the use of biometrics identifiers when filing tax returns. These sorts of real-world problems are just some of the many challenges facing innovative security startups, who need to hedge their bets carefully to maximise their chances of survival.

The increased market value is worrisome.  Between them, the increase in market value since the US election is $600 billion (€545.5bn). Outside of the tech bubble 17 years ago, this increase in value is unprecedented. Apple has a market capitalisation of $775bn (€705bn), which has increased by $220bn (€200bn) since November. The company is one of the largest in the world, second only to Saudi Aramco, which may be worth over $1.5 trillion (€1.37tn).  It is very questionable whether Apple can justify being valued at over three-quarters of a trillion dollars given the company’s growth profile is very mature and may be only several years away when profitability peaks. There is no question that Apple has been incredibly successful.  Therein lies the problem. No company has been able to dominate the mobile phone market without ultimately experiencing a significant decline in value.  Companies such as Nokia, Ericsson, and Motorola dominated the market during much of the 1990s before other companies such as Samsung and Blackberry moved in. Phone hardware manufacturers are renowned for being slow adopters to changing technologies, fashions and trends.  Each one believes that their product is the best and that competition differentiation will fail to usurp their market share.  Blackberry is one of the best case studies in this regard. Management refused to believe customers would want a touch screen, a decision compounded by further mistakes that almost destroyed the company.  Apple is not at the same point as Blackberry but is likely to be approaching its peak operating performance. With annual revenue exceeding $230bn (€209bn) and net income approaching $50bn (€45bn), it will be difficult to generate meaningful growth. Apple management is also using the company’s significant cash balances to purchase shares in the company, while its shares trade at record levels.  As part of the company’s recent quarterly results, management increased their capital return programme by $50bn (€45bn), including an increase in the share price repurchase authorisation from $175bn (€159bn) to $210bn (€191bn).  Given Apple’s success, it may be a better move to use the cash to identify acquisitions rather than repurchasing shares at a market capitalisation of $775bn (€705bn) that no other company has been able to sustain over the longer term. The company does not appear to generate the level of innovation that built the core foundation of its products. In the industry the company finds itself, this lack of innovation is likely to stymie future growth prospects.  The current share price of $149 (€136) is difficult to justify and shareholders should be willing to accept Apple could quite easily move 30% lower. That would only put it back to where the shares traded last November.

Home Secretary Amber Rudd backed away from the idea yesterday, saying she was 'not convinced' imposing fines was the best way to prevent extremists putting videos and documents online. Reports last month had suggested ministers were drawing up plans to impose swingeing fines on web firms who failed to stop poisonous content appearing. But yesterday Miss Rudd said the focus instead was on pressurising the companies to ensure that the material didn't 'go up in the first place'. 'I'm not convinced that that [fines] is the way to get the outcome that we want, which is for these companies to turn their expertise and resources to making sure this hate material isn't on their websites,' she told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live. 'They showed a lot of goodwill about wanting to do it. I'm putting pressure on them to use their brilliant expertise into making sure this material doesn't go up in the first place.'

Share this article Share 'I don't think it's necessarily going to have the outcome that I want which is getting this stuff taken down. 'I think that just saying we're going to fine you if you don't do it isn't the way to get them to take the material down.' Pressure has grown in recent months for a major crackdown on web and social media giants who allow extremist content to appear online. YouTube – which is owned by Google - saw major firms withdraw their adverts after far right videos were found alongside their products. Reports last month had suggested ministers were drawing up plans to impose swingeing fines on web firms who failed to stop poisonous content appearing. Pictured: Facebook's founder In March, in the wake of the Westminster terror attack, Miss Rudd said she was not 'stepping away from legislation' when it came to web firms. Germany has threatened severe penalties for internet companies that fail to crack down on illegal content and hate speech. It is considering plans to fine them up to £44million for failing to remove such posts. But Miss Rudd now appears to have ruled out any similar measures in Britain. MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee had argued recently that web giants should be fined tens of millions of pounds for failing to remove extremist and hate crime material promptly from their websites. The Home Affairs Select Committee said the largest and richest technology firms are 'shamefully far' from taking action to tackle illegal and dangerous content, it said in a report. In a report, they called for criminal charges against web firms which fail to take down vicious material even after it had been reported to them. The Home Affairs Select Committee said the largest and richest technology firms are 'shamefully far' from taking action to tackle illegal and dangerous content Sites that spread terrorist propaganda, far-Right racial abuse and murderous threats were probably already committing offences punishable by jail, the committee concluded. They said sanctions should include heavy fines for companies that fail to take down hate material within a short time. The MPs accused them of putting profit before public safety. They said Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, were 'outsourcing their responsibilities at zero expense' by demanding users report material before they will take it down. They argued that the companies should be made to pay the cost of policing their sites for vicious material in the same way that football clubs pay police to maintain order on matchdays. At the time, Miss Rudd welcomed the report, and said social media firms now had to prove that they were serious about tackling criminal activity online. It is estimated that half of all crimes reported to police now involve social media, with extremist offences, hate crimes and threats of violence all being committed online.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 20 shares Most watched News videos Elderly woman with two dogs body slammed, thrown into pool Couple spotted getting amorous on Sydney's Bronte Beach Terrifying moment an EEL is removed on the operating table King Charles III teaser trailer sees the current Prince reign Presidential candidate Marine Le Pen seen leaving Mayor's house President elect Macron says he wants to unite torn France Van driver tries to dangerously ram cyclist out of the way Moment a street vendor is beaten in the Bronx suffers skull fracture Model filming an underwater shoot is BITTEN by a shark in U.S 'I wish they didn't let you in the country': Woman tells Muslim Moped gang break man's leg trying to steal bike in shock robbery Kate Thornton sends her condolences to Zoe Ball on BBC Radio Two Macron, 39, threatens to be tough on Brexit after...

Read More VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh government has signed agreements with three firms which are expected to create over 12,000 jobs in the state in the next few years. Memoranda of understanding were signed with EVX Solutions Ltd, Innova Solutions and I-Bridge INC. The MoUs were entered into on the second day of chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu-led a high-level delegation's visit on Saturday (IST) in San Francisco. While EVX Solutions Ltd is expected to create 10,000 jobs, Innova Solutions is planning to offer jobs to 2,000 people. The delegation later met chief operating officer (COO) of Apple Jeff Williams and invited the firm to invest in Andhra Pradesh. Naidu urged Apple to establish a manufacturing facility in the state. Earlier in the day, the chief minister visited Google's X facility that developed Google's driver-less cars and glasses projects besides using balloons for spreading internet. He interacted with firm's CEO Astro Teller and discussed the latest technological and innovative advancements. On the occasion, Google X has agreed to collaborate with the state to enhance Internet penetration in AP. Google X gave a demonstration of driver-less car and use of drones to deliver various products to homes to the delegation. Naidu also met with vice-president of Qualcomm Technologies Inc Gopi Sirineni who expressed keenness to work within AP on the fibre grid project. The CM asked Gopi Sirineni to study the current status of the project and identify where his firm can contribute. Later, he interacted with NRIs and appealed to them to invest in AP. "Time has come for you to do your bit for your motherland. We are looking for partnerships for development of the state and I invite you to invest in your state which is rich in natural resources," he appealed and said that prospective investors should focus on investing in manufacturing facilities. Minister for finance Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, government advisor (communications) Parakala Prabhakar, CM secretary G Saiprasad, Economic Development Board CEO J Krishna Kishore, CRDA principal secretary Ajay Jain, IT principal secretary K Vijayanand and secretary of industries Solomon Arokyaraj were present.

Sally Jones has recently become a “high priority” on the “kill list” of wanted terrorists, the Sunday Times of London reported. Jones, 49, has been implicated in two horrific, but foiled, plots to spill the blood of innocent Americans. The first was an attempt to live-stream the murder of a US veteran; the second was a plotted mass shooting at a North Carolina concert, the British newspaper reported. Jones also is believed to have joined in a failed plot targeting Queen Elizabeth in 2015, during V-J Day celebrations in London. Now Jones, originally from Kent in southeast England, is believed to be in Iraq or Syria, where she hopes to avoid the fate of her late ISIS hubby. The husband, Junaid Hussain, a computer hacker from Birmingham, England, was killed by a US drone in the then-ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria, in 2015. Jones and Hussain were celebrities in the ISIS world, with her recruiting women and him raking high in the caliphate’s technology operations through CyberCalipha. SEE ALSO ISIS widow leading secret gang of female jihadis 0:0 White Widow Sally Jones is heading up a secret army... Together, they were nicknamed “Mr. and Mrs. Terror.” Before devoting herself to dark, bloodthirsty ISIS masters, Jones was a guitarist in all-girl rock band Krunch. The mother of two might have already poisoned the minds of her two children with sick hatred. Shocking video emerged in August last year of children executing captured Kurds. One of the pint-sized terrorists was a young light-skinned boy, whom British anti-terrorism cops believe is Jones’ 11-year-old son, who now goes by the name Umm Hussain Britaniyah. Jones now goes by the name of Sakinah Hussain.

More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting where Buffett and his Vice Chairman Charlie Munger preside over a Q&A session. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint OMAHA – Listening to Warren Buffett never gets old to the tens of thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders who filled an arena this weekend to listen to the billionaire investor at the company’s annual meeting. More than 30,000 people came to Omaha to hear Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger talk. The 86-year-old chief executive and his 93-year-old partner have been leading the conglomerate for more than five decades, but the crowd is always listening for new tidbits of wisdom. Buffett is known for his candor and plain speaking. Berkshire’s top two executives acknowledged Saturday that they missed out on investing in Google years ago, but they expressed pride in the company they built through acquisitions and said they believe it will thrive for decades to come. “In retrospect, I think we were smart enough to figure out Google early, and we didn’t,” Munger said. Buffett and Munger have avoided technology investments for most of their careers because they said it was too hard to figure out which companies would win. Berkshire does now own 133 million Apple shares, but it just sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM shares because Buffett misjudged that firm. He had harsh words for Wells Fargo’s managers who failed to respond promptly to the sales practices scandal that cost former CEO John Stumpf his job last year. The bank said last fall that its employees opened up 2 million bank accounts without customer approval to meet unrealistic sales goals. Nati Harnik &#x2022; Associated Press More than 30,000 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders were in Omaha this weekend for the company’s annual meeting to hear CEO Warren Buffett — even people with just one share of stock. “The main problem was they didn’t act when they learned about it,” Buffett said. Berkshire is Wells Fargo’s biggest shareholder. Buffett said he still believes in the bank’s long-term prospects even though Wells Fargo ­mishandled the scandal. Several questions homed in on politics, and Buffett, a Democrat with close ties to former President Barack Obama, offered measured criticism of President Donald Trump’s policies. He argued that the American Health Care Act, which passed the House last week, amounted to “a huge tax cut for guys like me.” He also said rising health care costs, rather than high taxes, are the biggest drag on U.S. businesses. “Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness,” he said. Buffett said there’s no change in Berkshire’s plan to eventually replace him. He said one of the most important qualities his successor will need is a talent for wisely investing Berkshire’s cash. “We need a money mind as CEO,” said Buffett, who has no plans to retire. Dozens of companies Berkshire owns set up booths in an adjoining 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall to sell their products and take questions about their businesses. But Buffett is the celebrity that everyone wants to get close. When Buffett toured the exhibit hall, he was surrounded by a pack of reporters, shareholders and security officers. While Buffett met Mr. Peanut at the Kraft Heinz booth, Miami Dolphin Ndamukong Suh wandered a few feet away without a crowd.   The New York Times contributed to this report View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Google Assistant to arrive in Nougat, Marshmallow soon Ryan Thomas Namia March 3, 2017 8:28 am TECHNOLOGY 2.8K 0 DUBAI – Google’s virtual assistant, Google Assistant, will soon be available to phones running Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Previously available to Pixel phones, Google Assistant lets users talk to his phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about weather, flight information and appointments. Yes, it’s like Apple’s Siri. LG was one of the first smartphone makers to reveal it would feature the assistant on its new device, the G6. In its blog post, the assistant will be rolled out this week in the US, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well. “With this update, hundreds of millions of Android users will now be able to try out the Google Assistant,” Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, said. To use this (if you have Nougat or Marshmallow operating system), just long press the Home button and say “Ok Google” to get started. And now, you can ask things such as ‘What’s my confirmation number for my London flight,’ ‘Take me to Museu Picasso,’ ‘Do I need an umbrella today,’ and many more. According to its blog, there is no need to download the update because Google Assistant will be usable on phones running Nougat and Marshmallow with Google Play Services. “Our goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it. It came to Android Wear 2.0 – via new smartwatches – just a few weeks ago and, as we previewed in January, the Assistant is also coming to TVs and cars,” Hafsteinsson said.   Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply ab5Pn3 My brother suggested I might like this website.

Or that’s what Google co-founder Larry Page hopes will happen anyway. The billionaire is an investor in Kitty Hawk, the flying car startup that showed the world its aerial jetski in action last month. Uber also has plans to bring flying cars to U.S. airspace by 2020, which the company shared at a conference it held in April to discuss its big sky vision of operating a network of aerial taxis. But will anyone actually want to ride in one of these weird, dangerous looking things? Turns out a lot of people would. Researchers Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle from the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute recently conducted a survey with 508 respondents from across the country to ask what they thought about flying cars. The respondents were fairly evenly split between men (48 percent) and women (52 percent) and across age brackets. The study, published last month, showed that 44 percent of respondents were very interested in riding a fully autonomous flying taxi and 41 percent said they’d be interested in owning one. Still, even if people are down to ride, they’re not sold on safety. 63 percent of respondents reported to be very concerned about how safe it would be to ride in one of these things (20 percent were moderately concerned and 11 percent were only slightly concerned). That’s probably why nearly 80 percent said that they think it’s either very important or extremely important for flying cars to have a parachute on board. When it comes to lifting straight off the ground like a helicopter — rather than using a landing strip — 83 percent of respondents overwhelming said they’d prefer vertical take off. Men were more enthusiastic about the technology than women. 52 percent of male respondents reported feeling positive or very positive about flying cars, while only 38 percent of women were equally optimistic. And in terms of practicality, 62 percent said they’d prefer the flying cars to seat between 3 and 4 people and 41 percent felt a flying car should be able to go for a minimum of about 400 miles before needing to recharge or refuel. Here’s a video Kitty Hawk shared last month of its new aircraft: recode_divider More From Recode A ‘fake news’ crackdown could follow Macron’s election win in France Families of the San Bernardino terrorist attack victims have filed a lawsuit against Facebook, Google and Twitter Full transcript: ‘American Gods’ author Neil Gaiman on Recode Media Twitter bots are being weaponized to spread information on the French presidential campaign hack Macron’s French presidential campaign has been hacked less than 48 hours before the election Warner Music signed a new deal with YouTube, and promptly complained about YouTube Trending Families of the San Bernardino terrorist attack victims have filed a lawsuit against Facebook, Google and Twitter They contend that the tech industry and its practices have been “instrumental to the rise of ISIS.” Facebook admits ‘malicious actors’ spread misinformation during the 2016 U.S. election It also cites a government report that found Russia played a major role in the presidential race.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Live concerts are music tech’s next frontier Jaja Liao, Google@JajaLiao May 7, 2017 1:05 PM Above: TheWaveVR livestreams concerts in VR and offers interactive features that enable users to touch equipment or dance in the landscape Image Credit: TheWaveVR With recent speculation about Spotify soon going public (without an IPO) and the belated launch of Pandora Premium, the music streaming space is increasingly nearing both maturity and saturation. The market is crowded by such giants as Apple, Google, and Amazon, as well as smaller companies like Spotify, Deezer, Napster, Pandora, and Tidal. For 2016, it was estimated that Spotify had 43 million subscribers, followed by Apple Music  with 20.8 million and by Deezer with 6.9 million. At this point, it is unlikely that a new player can arise and grab a significant market share from the top players. However, it’s worth noting that in the United States, paid and ad-supported music streaming together generated $3.9 billion in revenue in 2015. In contrast, live music generated $9.3 billion in revenue — nearly three times as much — for the same period. This points to the large opportunity in live music, and some of the same aforementioned companies are looking to expand into the market. It’s almost a natural progression for these companies to expand from static audio streaming to live video streaming because they can leverage their experience with the music industry (think licenses, copyrights, etc.), as well as their existing platforms. For example, Pandora has run pilot livestreams with artists such as G-Eazy, Fall Out Boy, Jack White, and Mumford and Sons, and its product team is focusing on livestreamed shows. YouTube partners with large music festivals like Coachella and Ultra to livestream entire lineups. Twitter recently announced a partnership with Live Nation to livestream concerts. Tapping into the live concert space also makes sense because of people’s interest in livestreaming generally. Thanks to Facebook Live and other services, livestreaming has gone mainstream. If we’re already used to seeing livestreams of Trump press conferences on Facebook and NFL games on Twitter, then it isn’t strange for to us watch Beyoncé concerts on Spotify. But what’s in it for the artists? Currently, many artists make most of their income from live concerts, not from streaming or digital sales. Won’t livestreaming concerts cannibalize tickets for live concerts? It seems unlikely: In fact, 67 percent of livestream viewers are more likely to buy a ticket to a concert/event after watching a livestream of that concert/event or a similar one. Jordan Zachary, chief strategy officer of ticket sales company Live Nation, said the company’s data shows that consumption of live content increases a fan’s desire to attend the concert: “Research shows that millennials highly value live experience, and we believe live attendance will continue to grow globally.” Following this logic, livestreaming concerts may actually augment an artist’s concert ticket sales. This is likely because the physical concert experience  —  acoustics, atmosphere, energy , etc. — can never be completely replicated virtually. People pay for more than the live music  alone;  they pay for the live concert experience. And the people who watch online are likely those who find the physical concert geographically or cost prohibitive. They were not going to buy live concert tickets in the first place. Further, livestreamed concerts can help artists collect and analyze data. Artists could gather data about their fans and audience from live concert streams, much like they already do from traditional streaming tools, like Spotify’s Fan Insights portal. If livestreaming concerts are merely additive and promotional for an artist, the opportunity to add another source of data about fans and audiences offers value for minimal risk. In addition, with virtual reality on everyone’s minds, it should be no surprise that there are startups looking to livestream concerts in VR. In 2014, vantage.tv livestreamed Coachella in 360 in conjunction with the release of the Coachella VR app and cardboard. This year, with YouTube added to this partnership, Goldenvoice (the company that produces Coachella) integrated the 360 broadcast with a highly trafficked 2D broadcast so users could toggle between 2D and VR. So far, vantage.tv has recorded and created more than 120 in-venue live VR broadcasts from Outside Lands, Coachella, Lollapalooza, and other festivals. Another startup, TheWaveVR, livestreams concerts in VR and offers interactive features that enable users to touch equipment or dance in the landscape. AR, too, has potential to change live concerts beyond traditional livestreaming and VR livestreaming. This year, the Coachella app contained AR filters and overlays. In the future, we may start seeing more mixed reality and immersive media (like holograms) as part of live concerts. Live concert streaming and expansions into VR and AR represent new opportunities — for both large companies and startups, that may reinvigorate the crowded streaming music category. The benefits of livestreaming concerts suggest that timing is right for music tech to play new a chord. Jaja Liao works in mobile partnerships acquisitions at Google.

Google’s update helps avoid crowds in real time Ryan Thomas Namia December 4, 2016 12:33 pm TECHNOLOGY 2.5K 0 DUBAI – Google’s latest update helps users avoid packed places in real time. Photo from Google) The firm has started to roll this out last week, just look up a business and tap on the arrow to get more information. The search engine will give users a live analysis on how busy the business is and what users are up against if he goes there. The latest enhancement, according to a cnet.com report, will determine how crowded an area is within an hour’s time based on aggregated, anonymized location history data. “It can also help users manage their time by providing live crowd numbers for specific businesses,” the report said noting that one could check the stores around it to see where he can go to kill time until the crowd dies down. For restaurants, it added that it will give you a hint of how long one might have to wait for a table well before reaching the door.  Facebook Comments Website Comments clash of clan hack December 28th, 2016 Reply I always spent my half an hour to read this web site’s articles every day along with a mug of coffee. love anal March 5th, 2017 Reply jaJiDQ Your means of describing the whole thing in this post is really good, all be able to easily understand it, Thanks a lot. venue finder March 6th, 2017 Reply Hey, thanks for the blog post.Really looking forward to read more.

Google is testing a way to make tab casting video suck a lot less, and you can try it Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 1:19pm PDTApr 25, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 63 Share on Twitter Total Shares189 Chromecast Google News Google has introduced a new tweak in Chrome Dev channel for streaming full-screen video tabs to Chromecasts, significantly improving power consumption and streaming performance. Now your Chromecast can directly pull the video itself. Obviously there are lots of major and minor benefits to being able to stream any video feed to your Chromecast at higher quality. Now you can stream live feeds and videos from sources that didn't previously support Chromecast streaming, or for which the old methods resulted in a stuttery or low-quality stream. To put it simply: casting Amazon Prime (or other feeds that didn't have Chromecast support) just got better. Now we were certainly able to cast tabs before. But, the quality and performance sometimes left a bit to be desired, especially on lower-end machines. The video wasn't going straight to the Chromecast. It had to use your computer to render things locally, re-encode them, and spit them out over the network to the Chromecast. The new system trims the fat, sending supported video content bitstreams directly, mitigating the overhead and improving performance while also decreasing the processing power required by the host machine. The changes are exclusive to the developer channel release of Chrome for now, and they require that you flip a flag in chrome://flags/#media-remoting to enable the feature. I was able to get it working on an old potato laptop with Amazon Prime, Adult Swim, and a few other services that don't have native Chromecast support. Before, the "Cast a tab" streaming resulted in a laggy mess that sucked my underpowered laptop's battery dry. Now, things are buttery smooth on both my TV and my ancient computer. It might still suck that Amazon doesn't want users of its services to watch stuff on Chromecasts, but if you are using one anyway through the various workarounds like chrome's tab streaming, then things should be a bit smoother for you now. Binge-watching The Man in the High Castle just got a tiny bit better. Source: Google+ Tags casting chromecast dev channel streaming subscribe ...

Mysticode Is 5.1 audio supported? DarthHaro I believe so makapav Good point. Chromecast in general sucks with 5.1 sources. Benoit Bourdua I have seen a page lately saying its possible to get hd audio formats to play through Plex (but have yet to try it) so the Chromecast looks like it's able to deal with a lot. makapav I have both, Plex on PC and Nvidia SATV. Take it with a pinch of salt. Ryne Hager I do not know, actually. I know the Chromecasts should support it, but I can't verify and don't have the tools to test that 5.1 channel audio from a tab works. TechGuy22 MKV supported ? i know my shield doesn't play them through chromecast Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Probably not as it doesn't fall under the list of supported formats: https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media TechGuy22 lame 4Ui812 It's not lame , It's Google. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It might be supported from a technical standpoint as MKV is only a container for data, but the video files within would need be in a supported codec like VP8 or H.264. John Rename it to MP4. ddevito Chrome for Android needs better casting functionality. For example, I'd like the ability to cast the page(s) I'm surfing but cast it full screen on my TV (not simply casting my phone's display) Ryne Hager I'd love to see it improved on mobile, too. Alejandro What ? How can you cast a webpage on Android? I thought you could only cast the entire screen, unlike the desktop version of chrome. ddevito Yes, exactly. That's what I'd like to see get added Alejandro The last part you mentioned got me confused, sorry Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ But why not casting the whole display? There is literally no difference? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7d76a0ecedcec617e108bc3d0216a7dc189878e7921186fbafd0c1b5f50ae5f3.gif ddevito Yes there is. I don't want to see my Navi buttons, my notifications or the tray. I just want to see the content. I also want it to expand to the width of my TV. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Okay okay, maybe the Immersive Mode app could help you with this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmd.immersive mma173 e.g. you might want to show friends a website and still be able to navigate through your phone without them seeing your private content. Deplorable Me Enough with thhe image gif memes! SilentException I'm actually on Chrome Beta channel (v58 x64) and have that option as well. Nice tip! Although, this is the way it should have been working from the beginning :) Andy J For supported content yes, but even this method is only going to be useful for mp4 videos, pretty much everything else is still going to have to re-encoded by the computer and then streamed to the Chromecast. Bombaglad tmithc is awesome! T4rd Nice.. now I'll be able to cast Amazon Prime videos whether they like it or not. =p Ryne Hager And they won't be a stuttery mess! Richard Riker At least as long as Amazon doesn't find a way around that, to deliver them in a format Chromecast doesn't support or so... At least I wouldn't be surprised Ryne Hager I know, I'm just waiting for them to break it. LazarusDark Yeah, but you won't get the best quality. Amazon only allows lower quality streams on PC, you are better off getting a roku for cheap, or the ShieldTV, which I recommend. Carson Saldanha When will we be able to natively cast the same thing to two different Chromecasts on Chrome? Carson Saldanha Need this for Google Slides John Doe It did not work for me on Amazon prime, I tried The Man in the High Castle and it also did not work on all Vimeo videos that I tried. I am running latest Chrome on Macbook pro. It doesn't even try with Amazon prime and on a few Vimeo videos it tries but then it ends up playing on both devices like it used to. I am not running the chrome dev channel but I was able to enable the flag in the stable version of chrome. hiram lowe I guess thats what you get for not following instructions then. John Doe It does work with a few videos in Vimeo...pay attention. Maxr1998 Great improvement, can't wait to try it out! Oh, and I'd so much binge-watch The Man in the High Castle, if I hadn't finished it already :D Great show! makapav > old potato laptop Laughed way too much at that description. Derp Can they PLEASE fix the mess that is YouTube casting. Bruce Wayne What's wrong with it? Lonerwithaboner420 It's laggy as hell and the sound is all jacked up Bruce Wayne What device are you casting to and from? Lonerwithaboner420 TV from fully updated PC Chrome. Bruce Wayne Is it a TV with Android TV or a Chromecast connected to the TV? Lonerwithaboner420 Chromecast Bruce Wayne Ah, yeah. I've heard that too. Especially on the 1st generation Chromecast. I cast to an Sony 4K TV with Android TV built in and streaming is smooth. I don't think they're ever going to fix the issue with the Chromecast. Lonerwithaboner420 I'm not what sure generation I have, got it last year, but either way that problem shouldn't exist. Thank god theyre fixing the issue in the article. Streaming live sports is painful the way it is now. David Hyman I used to care about amazon video not being on chromecast until i realized that my smart tv streams prime in 4k. its way too hard to go back :) Benoit Bourdua Great news! Should help with streaming sport events. Look forward to trying it. Dan It's cool that they are adding streaming the content directly but this doesn't mean we can cast Amazon now. The Chromecast pulls streams directly from the provider so unless they support syncing your account information which Amazon won't. It will just get blocked. As if you just tried pasting the address of a video stream in to a browser that doesn't have your cookie information. All of which something a technology writer should know... Andy J I'm not sure why you think that - the way these things tend to work these days - is that when you are logged in and you start to stream, you are provided a unique URL for your account, or you are provided the same CDN url as everyone else but with nonces and extra security added on the end so the CDN can verify it's really you. Dan The specifics of the mechanics change nothing. Amazon doesn't provide for it and Google isn't going to build circumvention into their browser. Dan Have you been able to cast Amazon yet? Portzblitz Been over the flag list twice. Even searched in-page! Please help; is it actually called "media remoting"? Andy J Yup I just copied it and then opened a new tab and pasted it in and it was there, there is another one underneath it to allow you to send encrypted content directly to the Chromecast too. But my (STABLE) Chrome updated to v58 yesterday, so check you are at least on v58 first. I'm just going to restart now and see if it works on stable despite the article saying it's exclusive to the dev channel. Edit - I'm back and it's working on STABLE v58. Portzblitz Thanks, cheers. I'll try again. Stable too.. I simply must watch my European football on a big screen! Vesuvius Do you use Acestream? The quality is superb Seusk Don't know if this is new or not, but the Netflix cast a tab support is great!! Andy J Just to say it's working here on v58 on the STABLE channel - build 58.0.3029.81 (64-bit) Naxx ENVY it works! and its awesome John Does it support non-embedded subtitles? Ty I just got the Dev build, I enabled the flag, but I tested it on amazon prime video and I cant tell that it's working. I can still see my mouse on the screen. I am trying it with TNT (watching the playoffs), and that seems to definitely not be working. Can anyone confirm this?

X Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger reassess tech sector Buffett investing in tech shows he's 'either learning or crazy’, says his right-hand man about 13 hours ago Eric Platt Omaha Berkshire Hathaway shareholders watch the company’s annual meeting, at which Buffett and Munger rued several of the tech investments they never made. Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters         It was with his traditional glib mannerism that Charlie Munger – Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman and Warren Buffett’s right-hand man – hurled a cavalier remark at the Oracle of Omaha. Mr Buffett had long avoided investments in the technology sector, focusing on stocks and businesses he understood and could value, a core tenet of what he considers his circle of competence. Then, six years ago, he invested in IBM. In 2016 he followed with a stake in Apple. “It shows either that you’re learning or you’re crazy,” Mr Munger said on stage in front of tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders who travelled to Omaha for the company’s annual meeting on Saturday, many of whom came simply to listen to the two men talk. “I hope it’s that you’re learning.” Over the weekend, the two famed value investors rued several of the tech investments they never made, heaping praise on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and online search group Google. It was a noticeable shift from a company that owns Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom, Lubrizol, Geico and Benjamin Moore. I was too dumb to realise what would happen . . . I did not think Jeff Bezos could succeed on the scale that he has Mr Buffett confessed that he had made a mistake not investing in Google and had underestimated Mr Bezos. “I was too dumb to realise what would happen . . . I did not think he could succeed on the scale that he has.” The reassessment of a maturing technology sector comes at a critical time for Berkshire, which is worth more than $410 billion and has nearly $100 billion in cash on hand to invest. Over the next decade, Mr Buffett or a successor will deploy more capital on acquisitions and investment in Berkshire’s businesses than he has in his entire 52 years at the helm. Businesses that need little in terms of capital investments with scale will be key. That is a point that the Berkshire chief is well aware of: the only five publicly traded companies with higher market valuations than the sprawling conglomerate are in the technology industry. The coterie – Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook– is worth more than $2.5 trillion and requires “no equity capital”, he says. “It used to be that growing and earning large amounts of money required investment.” Not any more. Shy of start-ups Lawrence Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University who is considered an expert on Mr Buffett, said it was unlikely the Berkshire chief executive would soon invest in a start-up such as Uber or Snapchat. But his growing familiarity with the technology industry could mean a greater focus on the sector. “It is about his central competence. Once a company has been around for a few cycles, through multiple chief executives and developed a record, you can start to establish what this business will look like in 15 years. You can understand Apple and understand its position as easily as you can Coca-Cola or American Express. ” The detour through an industry Mr Buffett had long avoided followed hours of questioning of the two executives, which opened on the company’s investment in Wells Fargo and repeatedly touched on its relationship with 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity group with which it bought a controlling stake in Kraft Heinz. Mr Buffett said it would have been a “huge, huge, huge error” if executives at Wells had been alerted to the bank’s brewing fake accounts scandal and failed to act. “We agree with Mr Buffett’s comments and value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer,” a spokesperson for the bank said over the weekend. “We have taken decisive actions to fix the problems.” Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman Charlie Munger over the weekend. Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters Asked about the political risks of being associated with 3G, Mr Buffett offered a full-throated defence of the group and its practices, which several shareholders indicated they believe runs counter to the values typically espoused by Berkshire. Mr Buffett said that 3G was ready to buy out companies that “really needed change”. “Change is painful for a lot of people and I’d rather spend my days not doing that sort of thing.” He added that this year Berkshire might consider taking additional losses at the margin to take advantage of higher tax rates, should Congress pass sweeping tax cuts. Losses realised this year can be used to offset taxes on gains in the future. It was a short-term titbit from a company known for its long-term view on investing. - (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017)       Topics: Benjamin Moore Charlie Munger Eric Platt Jeff Bezos Lawrence Cunningham Congress George Washington University Amazon American Express Apple Berkshire Hathaway Capital Coca Cola Dairy Queen Facebook Fruit of the Loom Geico Google Heinz IBM Lubrizol Microsoft Oracle Wells Fargo Berkshire Omaha Read More Colm Lyons takes payments start-up Fire to UK Irish companies risk losing out on digital economy boom Siro and Enet announce strategic tie-up in broadband market Digicel to buy French overseas territories business for undisclosed sum Google to pay €306m to settle Italian tax dispute Cheaper ebooks on the cards as MEPs vote to lower VAT rate Malicious phishing email targets Google users  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Ireland set for fastest euro zone growth for fourth year in a row Work How to make a great first impression at a job interview Soccer Ken Early: Liverpool are a long way from socialism these days Innovation Storkbox offers help for expectant mothers Sponsored The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Charting a family adventure on the Shannon-Erne Waterways Latest Business Aryzta evaluating alternatives for Picard shareholding 07:26 Akzo sees latest PPG bid inadequate, weighs options 07:24 Euro drops after rising to six-month high 06:39 Ireland set for fastest euro zone growth for fourth year in a row 06:33 Wolfgang Münchau: Emmanuel Macron gives Europe hope 06:30 How to?

The latest version of the Android Pay app has revealed that Google is working on a feature called Visual ID which will allow users to authenticate loyalty points based on facial recognition. This has been discovered by the folks over at 9to5Google who dug deep into the latest version of Android Pay and found references in the code to this feature. The strings have revealed that users will first create a face template when they activate the feature. Participating retailers will have Visual ID cameras installed that will perform facial recognition when the customer walks in. The system will then determine the customer’s identity, find out their location in the store using Bluetooth and will then send loyalty details to the retailer. The lines of code also mention that Visual ID cameras will automatically delete all photos shortly after they’re taken and that they won’t be accessible by the store. This is going to put those concerned about privacy at ease.

Mark the date: Android Wear 2.0 will arrive on February 9 Claire Bautista January 27, 2017 9:11 am TECHNOLOGY 1.8K 0 DUBAI – Google’s smartwatch Android Wear 2.0 will be launched on February 9. A phone leaker, Evan Blass, last week, put on Twitter that the most awaited version of Android Wear will at last come. The second version of the watch, according to cnet.com report, looks to completely revamp the operating system and help make watches less reliant on phones. Aside from that, the next version will add an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. As if it isn’t cool enough, the firm will also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google’s intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel smartphone. The report noted that earlier, it was already confirmed that not all Android watches will get the updated version. The original Moto 360 and LG G Watch won’t be upgraded to Android Watch 2.0.

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Monday May 8, 2017 About Us App Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Thousands fill arena to hear from Warren Buffett By Josh Funk, AP  Monday, May 8, 2017, 12:01 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 OMAHA, Nebraska -- Listening to Warren Buffett never gets old to the thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders who filled an arena Saturday to listen to the billionaire investor at the company's annual meeting. More than 30,000 people came to Omaha to hear Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger talk. The 86-year-old CEO and his 93-year-old partner have been leading the conglomerate for more than five decades, but the crowd is always listening for new tidbits of wisdom. Buffett is known for his candor and plain speaking. Berkshire's top two executives acknowledged Saturday that they missed out on investing in Google years ago, but they expressed pride in the company they built through acquisitions and said they believe it will thrive for decades to come. "In retrospect, I think we were smart enough to figure out Google early, and we didn't," Munger said. Buffett and Munger avoided technology investments for most of their careers because they said it was too hard to figure out which companies will win. Berkshire does now own 133 million Apple shares, but it just sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM shares because Buffett misjudged that firm. Buffett had harsh words for Wells Fargo's managers who failed to respond promptly to the sales practices scandal that cost the former CEO his job last year. The bank said last fall that its employees opened up 2 million bank accounts without customer approval to meet unrealistic sales goals. "The main problem was they didn't act when they learned about it," Buffett said. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Buffett said he still believes in the long-term prospects of the bank even though Wells Fargo mishandled the scandal. Buffett said there's no change in Berkshire's plan to eventually replace him. He said one of the most important qualities his successor will need is a talent for wisely investing Berkshire's cash. "We need a money mind as CEO," said Buffett, who has no plans to retire. 1|2|Next Page>> NEXT ARTICLE Family of Trump's son-in-law soliciting Chinese investment Facebook Twitter Google+ Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Terry Gou in apparent White House meeting with Trump 2 Trump admin. declines to brand China a currency manipulator 3 Media exec becomes 1st Taiwan student at Alibaba founder's school for entrepreneurs 4 Gogoro to increase battery-swapping stations 5 Hon Hai reportedly one of four bidders for Toshiba IC assets 6 Terry Gou confirms US investment push after another White House visit 7 PX Mart in hot water after boss slams 'spendthrift' youth 8 Taiwan shares plunge amid rising geopolitical tensions 9 GlobalWafers issues most GDS by Taiwan firm in over 3 years 10 Gov't caught unawares by Gou-Trump White House meet Subscribe  |   Advertise  |   RSS Feed  |   About Us  |   Career  |   Contact Us Sitemap  |   Top Stories  |   Taiwan  |   China  |   Business  |   Asia  |   World  |   Sports  |   Life  |   Arts & Leisure  |   Health  |   Editorial  |   Commentary Travel  |   Movies  |   TV Listings  |   Classifieds  |   Bookstore  |   Getting Around  |   Weather  |   Guide Post  |   Student Post  |   Terms of Use  |   Sitemap   Copyright © 1999 – 2017 The China Post.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Better than Facebook? Nextdoor Broke the Social Network Mold By Paul Lewis PUBLISHED: MAY 07 2017 Nextdoor, the social network that helps neighbors talk to each other, has a billion-dollar valuation and a presence in streets from San Jose to Liverpool. But according to its CEO, none of the tech giants are interested in acquiring it. "Facebook, Google, those guys haven't actually come and talked to us," said Nirav Tolia. "It's maybe hard, when you're the big Goliath, to take some of these little mice seriously," he added. "And we're OK being a mouse... Because the mouse is getting stronger every day." Tolia, 45, is a fast-talking businessman with a string of startups and a penchant for hubristic mouse metaphors. He is the archetype of a California tech entrepreneur. Nextdoor, in contrast, breaks the Silicon Valley mold. The company -- an unapologetically utilitarian place to share recommendations about dentists, find out where to dump a used sofa or receive alerts about local police activity -- has been expanding across the US over the past seven years. It has been a very different path to the shooting-star trajectory of viral, app-based startups. "We're not Snapchat, we're not Instagram," Tolia said. "We don't have 50 million users in six months." One reason for the delayed growth has been Nextdoor's reliance on a kind of crowd-sourced approach to defining neighborhoods, in which communities themselves draw the borders to their communities and name them. But that "slow and steady" approach is starting to pay off, Tolia said, adding that the company now has "tens of millions" of users. (A company spokesperson later said the figure is usually described as "millions.") Still, the growth has been impressive. Five years ago, Nextdoor had just 7,000 neighborhood groups. Today it claims to have more than 137,000 -- which it says amounts to roughly 70% of America's neighborhoods. And now the company is making forays into Europe, via recent launches in the Netherlands and the UK. That incremental approach to expansion is unusual for social media companies. So, too, is Nextdoor's professed commitment to ensuring a cordial online community. It has been called "the anti-Facebook," but in ethos, at least, it might be better described as the version of Facebook that Mark Zuckerberg wishes he had created. No Ranting Nextdoor threads and posts are by no means immune to controversy, but there is nothing like the febrile, combative tone that has contaminated other social media -- in part because members are required to use real names and addresses. But the startup does more than just verify identities; it rigorously enforces a culture of civility with rules that prohibit, for example, debate about "non-local issues that are known to be highly controversial," even going so far as explicitly discouraging conversations about presidential politics. Guidelines warn users they cannot "berate," "belittle," "troll," or "swear" and urges them to report any neighbors guilty of "over-posting, campaigning, repeatedly posting, or ranting about controversial, non-local issues. (A rant is defined as: "ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation, provocative language, judgmental accusations, or repetitive explanations.") It is hard to imagine how Facebook, Reddit or Twitter would survive 24 hours under such strict rules. Tolia concedes these regulations run "completely counter" to Silicon Valley's prevailing free speech culture. But he believes they're essential. "We have from the very beginning felt that community, and avoiding things that are divisive, are at the very core and foundation of what we've done," he said. "It's not something that we've had to bolt-on after some crisis." That's not entirely true. In late 2015, Nextdoor became known as a forum in which neighbors were using the popular "crime and safety" forums to flag racially biased reports of suspicious activity in their community. The company, to its credit, amended its technology to block users from reporting suspicious activity on the basis of race alone. Tolia said the episode only galvanized the firm's mission to stamp out conflict between people. "Nextdoor's view is that you can disagree... without being disagreeable," he said. The key to monetizing Nextdoor is their cache of verified personal data. Tolia claims the company is on the cusp of offering a level of targeting that is even more granular and reliable than that of Google and Facebook, who dominate the $60bn industry in digital ads. Nextdoor's data could be especially useful to the burgeoning and controversial market in political advertising, in which companies are overlaying detailed data about voters to target the most persuasive ads. But political ads will only work on Nextdoor if its users are discussing politics. That may explain why Nextdoor, in a move that seemed to be contrary to its aversion to conflict, recently started hosting local forums about hot political topics. "We want to create a kind of area in the service where those conversations can happen, and people can passionately argue one way or another," Tolia said. He played down a report in Politico that the move was intended as an entry into the lucrative market of political influencing. But he conceded he was approached by a company that "could take your address and put it through a voter database and see everyone you've voted for and then show you an ad that was personalized to your beliefs." He added: "We felt that was not something that would sort of build our credibility as a company." Asked if he could guarantee that Nextdoor would not micro-target political ads, Tolia got a few words in before his PR executive, who was also present, interrupted. "Don't!" she said. "Don't guarantee all this." He was reluctant to be drawn further. "This is such a theoretical conversation," he said. "Because, we literally have never had any of these conversations." But what about the example he just gave about the advertiser who wanted to target voters through Nextdoor? "Five years ago," he replied. "We had one conversation." Then Steve Wymer, a former Republican operative recently hired as a vice-president at Nextdoor, who was also sitting in on the interview, intervened. He reminded his boss they "were in New York a couple of weeks ago and we talked to a political targeting ad group." Tolia nodded but added a clarification. "We just said we're not interested," he said. "And we haven't followed up." © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: Nextdoor.

Intel To Buy Mobileye for $15.3 Billion Next Article > Uber Facing Federal Probe for Tool That Helped Evade Regulators PUBLISHED: MAY 05 2017 The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into Uber's use of Greyball, a secret software that worked to deceive authorities in areas where the ride-sharing service was banned or restricted. Greyball helped Uber evade officials in cities where the company's service was not yet approved or regulated. The software identified and blocked rides to transportation regulators posing as Uber customers to prove the company was operating illegally. The Greyball tool allowed the company to deploy what served as a fake version of its app to evade authorities. The New York Times, which first revealed the software in March, reported Uber's legal team approved Greyball. After the initial report, Uber said it would prohibit employees from using the software. The Justice Department's investigation into Uber was disclosed in a transportation audit issued by Portland, Ore., last week. Portland officials said the U.S. attorney's office for the U.S. Northern District of California notified them about the existence of an investigation into Uber. Uber has faced a number of recent crises. In January, the company agreed to to pay $20 million to resolve federal charges that alleged the company misled potential drivers by overstating the incomes they can earn. In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler Rigetti, in a blog post, described systemic sexism and sexual harassment at the company, which prompted an internal investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. © 2017 UPI Top Stories under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

But the startup does more than just verify identities; it rigorously enforces a culture of civility with rules that prohibit, for example, debate about "non-local issues that are known to be highly controversial," even going so far as explicitly discouraging conversations about presidential politics. Guidelines warn users they cannot "berate," "belittle," "troll," or "swear" and urges them to report any neighbors guilty of "over-posting, campaigning, repeatedly posting, or ranting about controversial, non-local issues. (A rant is defined as: "ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation, provocative language, judgmental accusations, or repetitive explanations.") It is hard to imagine how Facebook, Reddit or Twitter would survive 24 hours under such strict rules. Tolia concedes these regulations run "completely counter" to Silicon Valley's prevailing free speech culture. But he believes they're essential. "We have from the very beginning felt that community, and avoiding things that are divisive, are at the very core and foundation of what we've done," he said. "It's not something that we've had to bolt-on after some crisis." That's not entirely true. In late 2015, Nextdoor became known as a forum in which neighbors were using the popular "crime and safety" forums to flag racially biased reports of suspicious activity in their community. The company, to its credit, amended its technology to block users from reporting suspicious activity on the basis of race alone. Tolia said the episode only galvanized the firm's mission to stamp out conflict between people. "Nextdoor's view is that you can disagree... without being disagreeable," he said. The key to monetizing Nextdoor is their cache of verified personal data. Tolia claims the company is on the cusp of offering a level of targeting that is even more granular and reliable than that of Google and Facebook, who dominate the $60bn industry in digital ads. Nextdoor's data could be especially useful to the burgeoning and controversial market in political advertising, in which companies are overlaying detailed data about voters to target the most persuasive ads. But political ads will only work on Nextdoor if its users are discussing politics. That may explain why Nextdoor, in a move that seemed to be contrary to its aversion to conflict, recently started hosting local forums about hot political topics. "We want to create a kind of area in the service where those conversations can happen, and people can passionately argue one way or another," Tolia said. He played down a report in Politico that the move was intended as an entry into the lucrative market of political influencing. But he conceded he was approached by a company that "could take your address and put it through a voter database and see everyone you've voted for and then show you an ad that was personalized to your beliefs." He added: "We felt that was not something that would sort of build our credibility as a company." Asked if he could guarantee that Nextdoor would not micro-target political ads, Tolia got a few words in before his PR executive, who was also present, interrupted. "Don't!" she said. "Don't guarantee all this." He was reluctant to be drawn further. "This is such a theoretical conversation," he said. "Because, we literally have never had any of these conversations." But what about the example he just gave about the advertiser who wanted to target voters through Nextdoor? "Five years ago," he replied. "We had one conversation." Then Steve Wymer, a former Republican operative recently hired as a vice-president at Nextdoor, who was also sitting in on the interview, intervened. He reminded his boss they "were in New York a couple of weeks ago and we talked to a political targeting ad group." Tolia nodded but added a clarification. "We just said we're not interested," he said. "And we haven't followed up." © 2017 Guardian Web syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: Nextdoor.

Apple Takes Heat from Qualcomm War China Compiles Its Own Wikipedia Victims' Families Sue Social Sites Scam Alert: Don't Open Google Doc Next Article > Apple Takes Heat from Qualcomm Fight, Chinese Competition By Shirley Siluk / Mobile Tech Today. Updated May 05, 2017. Stung by Apple's recent decision to withhold royalty payments for its technologies in iPhones, chipmaker Qualcomm is reportedly planning to ask the Washington, D.C.-based International Trade Commission (ITC) to prevent importation of the devices into the U.S. Apple relies on Asia-based manufacturers to produce its flagship smartphones, and is already reported to be experiencing supply challenges ahead of its next big iPhone launch, expected in the fall. Citing "a person familiar with the company's strategy," Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Qualcomm is preparing to ask the ITC to block new iPhones from entering the U.S. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is facing multiple lawsuits recently filed against it by Apple in the U.S. and China, as well as allegations of unfair practices filed in January by the Federal Trade Commission. 'Need the Courts To Decide' The complaints stem from the royalties Qualcomm charges for Apple's use of its broadband processors, which enable mobile phones to connect with cellular networks. Qualcomm's modem chip design was used to set the industry standard for mobile communications, and the company agreed to license its technology to phonemakers on "FRAND" ("fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory") terms. In a lawsuit filed in January, Apple accused Qualcomm of unfairly charging royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with," adding that the company had withheld nearly $1 blllion in fees owed to Apple as "retaliation" for providing information about Qualcomm to regulators in South Korea. Last Friday, Qualcomm announced that Apple had begun withholding payments to manufacturers "for the royalties those contract manufacturers owe under their licenses with Qualcomm for sales during the quarter ended March 31, 2017." Qualcomm added that action would lower its expected third-quarter revenues by around $500 million. On Tuesday, during Apple's second-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said that he didn't believe case law would support an attempt to block iPhones from being imported into the U.S. "In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount," Cook added. "You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that." Tablet Troubles, China Slowdown While its dispute with Qualcomm continues, Apple is also facing challenges on several other fronts. Two recent reports from the analyst firm IDC show the company is slipping in its smartphone market share in China, and also feeling a pinch from global declines in tablet sales. Huawei and OPPO now hold the top two spots after double-digit growth over the past year, according to IDC's report on first-quarter smartphone sales in China. Apple's sales during the same period dropped nearly 27 percent, IDC said. But Apple retains the top spot in worldwide tablet sales, although first-quarter sales declined by 13 percent, according to a separate IDC report. The overall global tablet market shrank by 8.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2016, IDC added. IDC's smartphone report also noted that the next iPhone release this fall could improve Apple's position in China. "Apple has been seeing double-digit YoY declines for the fifth quarter in a row, but we believe that Chinese consumers are holding out for the launch of Apple's 10-year anniversary iPhone at the end of the year, and this will help Apple to see a rebound in the China smartphone market," IDC analyst Tay Xiaohan said in a statement.

This blowout sale allows clients to obtain even more savings on Lubbock SEO or Nationally located SEO, which is of great importance thanks to increased competition in most industries today. Contact Hone today to learn about the adaptive solutions for organizations looking to obtain new customers in an era of stressful, unreliable service. "Business owners should know that search engines continually update their algorithms to meet the changing needs of their users. For example, Google has now opted to increase the trending news it shows on the search engine results page, and this means there are fewer organic search results presented. The same is true of Wiki pages, local results and more. When 90% of people click the top 3 results and you are looking for leads online, internet marketing is a must. Companies need to ensure they stay on top of their search engine optimization strategy to remain visible to the public," Attilio Di Nunno, Owner of Hone Inc, announces. When search engines were first introduced, companies could simply use a keyword a multitude of times and move up in the search engines. This is no longer the case, as marketers have discovered. Now, in fact, 82 percent of marketers state SEO effectiveness is increasing. Companies must focus on numerous elements simultaneously, including on-page and off-page optimization, social media marketing, content creation and more. "We provide quick, low price, modern seo services and want to ensure our customers save money while receiving access to the latest SEO techniques. Companies making use of our services find they get new customers in a short period of time. No business can afford to be without this, and search engine optimization remains the best technique to build more brand awareness and increase a company's visibility in the search engines,"Di Nunno continues. Andrey Lipattsev, Google's Search Quality Senior Strategist, states Google looks at link building and high quality content first when ranking a site. Furthermore, longer content is typically found at the top of the search engines. Backlinko conducted a study and found that the content found on the first page of the Google search engine results page had an average of 1,890 words. Companies need to understand that they cannot focus on one area and expect to move up in the results. "Hone knows what search engines look for when ranking a page. As this is constantly changing, many business owners find it hard to keep up. Leave the search engine optimization to us and focus on other tasks, such as improving customer service. When we work together, great results and higher revenue is seen," Di Nunno declares. About Hone Inc: Hone Inc is a caring, informed marketing company that provides adaptive solutions for organizations looking for new customers in an era of stressful, unreliable service.

AndroidPolice conducted its own examination of the code, and noted that when a person’s identity is confirmed by Visual ID, the loyalty perks are automatically applied to the purchase. The system appears to use Bluetooth to detect a customer’s location, and presumably would require a camera in the store to take a picture of them. The system won’t actually save the image: it’ll compare it to an existing one provided by the customer, and then delete it. This isn’t the first time that Google has experimented with new ways for customers to pay for purchases. Two years ago, it announced Hands Free, an experimental program that allowed customers to pay by saying “I’ll pay with Google.” That program didn’t last long: Google shut down it down last year, but noted at the time that it planned to “bring the best of the Hands Free technology to even more people and stores.” We’ve reached out Google to learn more, and we’ll update if we hear back.

Google creates highly accurate lip-reading software Ryan Thomas Namia December 4, 2016 12:45 pm TECHNOLOGY 2.3K 0 DUBAI – Researchers from Google’s AI division DeepMind and the University of Oxford have collaborated and used artificial intelligence to make the most accurate lip-reading software to date. According to a report by cbronline.com, the AI system, which was trained using almost 5,000 hours of TV footage from the BBC, contained a total of 118,000 sentences from the videos. The key contributions include a “Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell” (WLAS), a network that learns to transcribe videos of mouth motion to characters. In an article published by arix.org, the goal of the work was to recognize phrases and sentences uttered by a talking face, with or without the audio. DeepMind stated that unlike previous works that have focused on recognizing a limited number of words or phrases, they tackle lip reading as an open-world problem – unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos. The same media report added that the AI was trained on shows which aired during the period between January 2010 and December 2015, and later tested its performance on programs between March and September of this year. The lip reader was only able to decipher less than one-quarter of the spoken words, whilst the WLAS model was able to decipher half of the spoken words. Based on the report, citing the News Scientist, Ziheng Zhou at the University of Oulu, Finland, said that it was a big step for developing fully automatic lip-reading systems. “Without the huge dataset, it’s very difficult for us to verify new technologies like deep learning,” he added. In its summary, the architecture of the WLAS model surpassed the performance of all previous work on standard lip reading benchmark datasets, and demonstrated that visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance even when audio is used.  Facebook Comments Website Comments mike tyson March 6th, 2017 Reply z1SL9Y Really appreciate you sharing this article.Thanks Again. rasen schneiden March 6th, 2017 Reply A big thank you for your blog article.Really looking forward to read more.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Hone Inc Announces a Huge May Blowout Sale on SEO Services   View as PDF  Print View    The adaptive solutions offered allow business to obtain new customers in an era known for unreliable, stressful service, WeAreHone.com reports Lubbock, Texas – May 6, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ — Hone Inc, which is among the first Lubbock search engine optimization providers, announces they are offering huge May savings. This blowout sale allows clients to obtain even more savings on Lubbock SEO or Nationally located SEO, which is of great importance thanks to increased competition in most industries today. Contact Hone today to learn about the adaptive solutions for organizations looking to obtain new customers in an era of stressful, unreliable service. „Business owners should know that search engines continually update their algorithms to meet the changing needs of their users. For example, Google has now opted to increase the trending news it shows on the search engine results page, and this means there are fewer organic search results presented. The same is true of Wiki pages, local results and more. When 90% of people click the top 3 results and you are looking for leads online, internet marketing is a must. Companies need to ensure they stay on top of their search engine optimization strategy to remain visible to the public,” Attilio Di Nunno, Owner of Hone Inc, announces. When search engines were first introduced, companies could simply use a keyword a multitude of times and move up in the search engines. This is no longer the case, as marketers have discovered. Now, in fact, 82 percent of marketers state SEO effectiveness is increasing. Companies must focus on numerous elements simultaneously, including on-page and off-page optimization, social media marketing, content creation and more. „We provide quick, low price, modern seo services and want to ensure our customers save money while receiving access to the latest SEO techniques. Companies making use of our services find they get new customers in a short period of time. No business can afford to be without this, and search engine optimization remains the best technique to build more brand awareness and increase a company’s visibility in the search engines,”Di Nunno continues. Andrey Lipattsev, Google’s Search Quality Senior Strategist, states Google looks at link building and high quality content first when ranking a site. Furthermore, longer content is typically found at the top of the search engines. Backlinko conducted a study and found that the content found on the first page of the Google search engine results page had an average of 1,890 words. Companies need to understand that they cannot focus on one area and expect to move up in the results. „Hone knows what search engines look for when ranking a page. As this is constantly changing, many business owners find it hard to keep up. Leave the search engine optimization to us and focus on other tasks, such as improving customer service. When we work together, great results and higher revenue is seen,” Di Nunno declares. About Hone Inc: Hone Inc is a caring, informed marketing company that provides adaptive solutions for organizations looking for new customers in an era of stressful, unreliable service.

More importantly, they’re still in with a chance of finishing in the top four with four matches left. They’re still sixth, but they’re seven points behind Liverpool, six behind Manchester City and two behind Manchester United. It’s not over yet and Arsenal can ramp up the pressure by beating Southampton on Wednesday night. As for United, their unbeaten run in the league, stretching back to October, is over and more than ever it seems their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League rest on winning the Europa League. Their workload’s caught up with them here. In fairness to Mourinho, however, the focus is on this Thursday’s second leg against Celta Vigo. They’ll take losing this one as long as they’re in Stockholm on 24 May. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye. Mourinhocongratultates Wenger after the final whistle.

The game’s drifting one moment, the next Arsenal have the lead. Granit Xhaka decides to have a pop from 30 yards. It’s a well struck effort with his left foot but it’s probably not going to beat De Gea - until, that is, it hits Herrera’s back and loops over the Spaniard and into the top right corner! Xhaka shoots from way outside the box, it takes a deflection. Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images De Gea is beaten.

One of many consequences of the government's comprehensive package of media reforms announced over the weekend is that Ten becoming part of the News Corp family starts to look more likely than not, argues Mumbrella's Tim Burrowes May 7, 2017 9:11 by Tim Burrowes 12 No wonder Rupert Murdoch looked so pleased as he shared a stage with Malcolm Turnbull and Donald Trump in New York on Friday night. We’ve been here before. Four decades after buying into Ten – and three decades after having to give it up again to pursue US citizenship – the path finally appears to be clearing for the network to return to the Murdoch family. Mind you, we have indeed been here before. Saturday morning’s big media reforms announcement is not the only attempt over the last decade to change the ownership laws. Both Labor and the Liberals have previously tried and failed. This time though, I suspect it will go through. With what appears to be consensus from all the key media owners, it would be a politician with little interest in being re-elected who stands against the media moguls’ collective wills. And (with the exception of the Australian taxpayer) the wide ranging package of reforms leaves almost every commercial media organisation a winner. Watch their share prices soar on the ASX when it opens on Monday morning. It’s just that, as is so often the case, it looks like the interests of the Murdoch family stand to be the biggest winner. The ownership laws are the most fundamental changes, but let’s leave the implications of that for a moment. Licence fees The most straightforward – and cosiest – win for Australia’s commercial broadcasters comes with the abolition of licence fees, replacing them with a charge to use the spectrum. Or, as the government describes it “moving to more efficient broadcasting fees”. In practice, the changes will see broadcasters (including both TV and radio) paying just a sixth of what they were being charged as recently as 2010. It’s only seven years since they were paying 9% of annual revenues, which amounted to $282m a year from the TV networks. Labor’s media minister Stephen Conroy started the ball rolling with a temporary discount, which later became permanent, announced in February 2010. Given that the figure the networks will be asked to pay will now be about $40m, that marks a triumph for the broadcasting companies’ lobbyists – and Free TV Australia chairman Harold Mitchell. And that sounds like quite a bargain to me for the ability to use public airwaves to broadcast to the entire population. In these times of Budget discipline, it would be interesting to know what the government wants in return from the people who broadcast news bulletins to its voters every single day. Although I suspect the answer lies in the question. The argument that the networks needed the help mainly because all the advertising money is these days flowing out to Google and Facebook does not fully stack up. The broadcasters’ contribution to the taxpayer has been reduced by a massive 86% over the last seven years. Yet, between 2010 and 2015 (the last full calendar year Free TV Australia released data for), advertising revenue for the networks only fell slightly from $3.97bn to $3.78bn, a drop of 4.8%. It strikes me that the main source of the TV networks’ commercial woes has actually been their competition with each other. In the race for audience share, they overpaid for US content, often on painfully long contracts, and have pushed up the cost of sports rights. Blaming Facebook and Google may be a tad simplistic. Still, according to the Department of Communications, industry regulator the Australian Communications and Media Authority “will be directed to conduct a review of spectrum pricing within five years to examine the operation of the new pricing structure and ensure the arrangements remain appropriate”. This will remain an excellent future stick with which the government will be able to keep TV networks in line. Given that the ACMA last month auctioned a tranche of spectrum to TPG and Vodafone for $1.5bn, and sold another $2bn worth to Optus and Telstra in 2013, the annual $40m the TV networks will be paying between them starts to look like remarkably cheap. Restrictions on gambling advertising The price the TV networks will pay to get the package of reforms through – and presumably neutralise potential crossbench opposition from the likes of Nick Xenophon – is to accept tighter restrictions on gambling advertising, particularly when games are on live. The principal losers on this will be Nine and Seven, whose NRL and AFL-loving audiences are attractive for the betting advertisers. Ten doesn’t have as much exposure, with its main sport now being Big Bash cricket, which it has been careful to cultivate as a family-friendly environment. For the last few years, the television industry’s over-reliance on gambling ads has become the tobacco advertising of its time. We hit something of a grubby low point back in March when Nine was found to be in breach of the current rules by showing ads for CrownBet during kids’ movie Spiderwick Chronicles, and trying to argue that it wasn’t a children’s film. Few, I suspect, will feel entirely sad to see better behaviour forced upon the networks. Sports betting tends to showcase the industry at its worst. Amending the anti-siphoning sports rules If one reform requires a degree of bravery from the Government, it’s making any move that takes sport away from an audience used to seeing it on free-to-air television. In a nutshell, the anti-siphoning list means that free-to-air broadcasters get first dibs on a long list of sports. But a couple of the anti-siphoning changes are uncontroversial. When every free-to-air secondary channel is as easily available as the primary ones, it was archaic that they weren’t treated the same. So it’s sensible to fix that. It’s also sensible that the free-to-air broadcasters will have to make their minds up if they want an event six months out, not be allowed to dither until it’s three months away. But some anti-siphoning changes will mean a much bigger win for News Corp’s Fox Sports, and for pay TV network Foxtel, which is jointly owned by News Corp and Telstra. There will be some grumbling from the public if they can’t watch Australia play in the Rugby World Cup without paying for it. And in a move which will mainly hurt SBS, I suspect, international soccer is also likely to mainly move to pay TV. Only Australia’s World Cup games will be protected for free to air. Other international teams won’t automatically be in terrestrial TV any more. And Socceroos qualifiers played overseas can move to pay TV too. Also off the list is the English FA Cup Final. For Rugby Union, only tests played in Australia or New Zealand will be protected. And only World Cup games involving Australia, plus the final, will remain guaranteed for free to air. One Day cricket fans may be discombobulated to discover that internationals involving Australia will only be protected when played at home or in NZ. And Davis Cup tennis matches played overseas will also be off the list. Tennis fans may also find themselves paying to watch Wimbledon and the US Open too. Meanwhile, golf could well disappear from free to air altogether, with the Australia Open, Australian Masters and US Masters all off the protected list. In motorsports, Bathurst will go, but the Australian F1 Grand Prix will remain. The crown jewels though – the Olympics, Melbourne Cup, State of Origin, plus NRL and AFL grand finals will all be safe. And if Fox Sports and Foxtel is the winner here, then free to air TV will lose out on what was sometimes relatively cheap programming. It will also create a dilemma for sports administrators who will more often face a choice between better exposure for their game on free to air, versus more dollars from pay TV. Local content There will also be new rules to protect local TV content if (read: when) licences change hands in what is known as a trigger event. Whether they amount to much in practice remains to be seen, with networks already masters of fulfilling minimal quota obligations in the cheapest possible way. Indeed, some of the new rules appear to be in direct recognition that the old ones weren’t working. Broadly, TV broadcasters will be required to deliver 900 minutes worth of local content per six weeks (or about half an hour per day). The requirements are halved if the programming is news. And if the content is actually filmed locally, each minute worth of content counts triple. None of that sounds too onerous for the networks. But the Department of Communications has made some nice graphics. Media ownership laws Which brings me on to the big one. The ownership laws. Currently, the TV networks are only allowed to reach a maximum of 75% of the population. And in any local area, media companies can only be in two out of three of free-to-air TV, radio and newspapers. It’s why the big three – Seven, Nine and Ten – are twinned with regional affiliates including Prime, SCA and WIN. That will change. This is the one that will send share prices soaring on Monday, as the market anticipates a wave of mergers and acquisitions.   There are about seven key clans in the forthcoming media Game of Thrones: The Murdoch family; Kerry Stokes; Bruce Gordon;  Fairfax shareholders; Nine shareholders; Southern Cross Austereo shareholders; and Prime Media Group shareholders. (Let’s assume for now that Ooh Media and APN Outdoor are focused on their proposed merger.) Some are potential buyers. Some are potential takeover targets. And some are both. To understand the complexities of ownership, take a look at ACMA’s ownership map.   Now look at it even more closely. Messy and complicated, isn’t it? Decide for yourself what might happen to Fairfax. The TPG Capital proposal which re-emerged over the weekend may bring about a breakup there sooner than you think. Of key interest are the various investments of News Corp and the Murdoch family – and their involvement with Ten. While the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission will still have a say in any deal, this would now only be in general terms rather than anything specific to media ownership law. And it’s hard to think of a deal big enough (with the possible exception of News Corp buying all of Fairfax’s newspapers) to see it blocked. As I’ve written previously, News Corp’s tendrils into Ten already go deep. Lachlan Murdoch owns about 8% of Ten already. Foxtel (half owned by News Corp) owns about 14% of Ten. Sales house MCN (majority owned by Foxtel with Ten owning 25% of it) already does advertising sales for Ten. One of Ten’s two major US content deals is with 21st Century Fox (executive co-chairman: Lachlan Murdoch). A sizeable proportion of Ten’s local reality formats are made by 21st Century Fox’s joint venture Endemol Shine. Lachlan Murdoch is one of three guarantors on a $200m loan facility to Ten due to be called in at the end of the year. Lachlan Murdoch: Will he be the biggest winner? Indeed, the only thing that obviously stands between News Corp and Ten is Bruce Gordon. The owner of regional player WIN, Gordon has a foot in the camps of both Nine and Ten, with a 15% stake in each. Last year, WIN’s affiliation switched to Ten, after Nine dumped WIN in favour of a new deal with Southern Cross Austereo. Like Lachlan Murdoch, Gordon holds another chip at the poker table, also being a guarantor on the loan facility. If Ten defaults when the loan becomes due in seven months’ time, Murdoch, Gordon and the third guarantor James Packer will have a say in what happens next, including having potentially first call on the network’s assets. Alternatively, Murdoch and Gordon could back Ten’s board by guaranteeing a new facility. The board says it needs this to be $250m in order to continue to be competitive. When this was revealed last month, the value of Ten on the ASX halved in less than a week. At close on Friday, it was worth just $80m. That’s just a sixth of what it was six months ago. And just a tenth of what it was worth less than two years ago. I’m sure that, with the licence fee relief and changes to the law, we’ll see a bounceback of Ten’s share price too on Monday. Regardless, there’s been little fun for Ten shareholders who are on the ride for investment reasons rather than to simply have a say in the end game. Not that there are many value investors left, I suspect. That, I’m sure, is what’s behind last month’s announcement to the ASX from Lazard Asset Management that it has started to sell down it’s 10% stake, dropping back to 8.75%. And, Ten still has plenty of turmoil ahead. One possibility is that Ten will once again have to issue (a lot of) new equity. if the loan isn’t rolled over, it could yet be nudged into administration. It’s already got restructuring firm KordaMentha on its books. The task facing Ten’s management still looks tough. First, the broadcaster needs a new $250m loan facility. That’s a big ask for a company with a market capitalisation of less than a third of that. And the only thing standing between the company’s directors and insolvency is that loan facility. The only likely way for it to come through would be for the three directors who guaranteed the previous facility, to put their money behind a new one. So the intentions of the three shareholders – Lachlan Murdoch, Bruce Gordon and James Packer – become vital. Their intentions were signalled a little in last month’s update. It suggested that the loan could be rolled over if a) A cost cutting restructure plan – aka “transformation process” could be put in place; b) The licence fee was cut; and c) The US studios let it off some of its liabilities. A couple of weeks back, all three things happening seemed unlikely. Now though, the planets have aligned. The government has done its bit – and not even waited for Budget day – by announcing the licence fee axeing. Then there’s internal cuts, sorry, transformation. That’s why management consultants McKinsey have been in the building. And that’s the key lever that management can directly pull directly. Deep job losses at what is already a tightly run ship will, I’m sure, be a certainty. Outsourcing the entire news operation to the News Corp’s Sky News starts to seem logical. The third key component is the cooperation of the US studios – CBS and 21st Century Fox – in renegotiating their content deals. In both cases these studios are already in three-legged races alongside Ten. These were deals entered into when US drama and comedy rated better – and all three of Australia’s networks raced to hand money to the US studios. In those years, the US studios benefited greatly from the competition between Seven, Nine and Ten. By contrast, the only currently bankable trend is reality. In CBS Studios’ case, the three-legged race is the unusual arrangement it has with Ten regarding its secondary channel, Eleven. Back in 2010, Ten and CBS found a way to slip inside the rules on TV licences to give CBS a stake in Eleven in return for supplying content. Ten owns two-thirds of ElevenCo (and the licence) while CBS Studios provides the content, and owns the other third. A single line in last week’s ASX update reveals that in the last six months, there was no dividend for CBS Studios based on the performance of ElevenCo. That was compared to a modest $700,000 dividend in the previous period. Ten’s ASX update briefly mentioned the CBS Studios relationship Given that Ten’s had no dividend to pay CBS for the performance of Eleven, one wonders just how much goodwill Ten has in the bank with the US studio over slimming down its main output deal which is reportedly as much as $120m a year (although I suspect it may be a bit less than that). It’s worth noting that it cost Nine a reported $100m to get out of its output deal with Warner Bros back in 2013. Seven allowed its own deal with NBC Universal to expire. However, CBS Studios will also be aware that if cutting a deal helps Ten survive, it will be in its own interests. Getting something is better than nothing. Related Content Just how much trouble is Ten in? (Answer: A lot more than you probably realise) Opinion Turnbull Government to abolish licence fees in media reform package News The other major studio Ten has an output deal with is in a different kind of three-legged race. As I’ve mentioned above, 21st Century Fox is a Murdoch company, with Lachlan Murdoch co executive chairman. What of course none of us are privy to, are what the three guarantors are actually thinking and saying to each other. Although it becomes ever more telling that Murdoch has chosen not to replace his representative on the Ten board which makes conflict of interest marginally less of an issue. Does Lachlan Murdoch actually want Ten? If you’d asked me on Friday, the mountain to climb of getting the media ownership laws changed would have made me doubt it. But then came Saturday morning’s announcement. What of Bruce Gordon’s intentions? He’s been a long term investor. But is also 88-years-old. A major motivation for him will be how to secure the future – or failing that, the value – of the WIN assets he’s spent a lifetime building up. And the wild card of James Packer’s 8% stake. Originally, he and his friend Lachlan Murdoch had agreed to vote their shares in concert; but there was a falling out when Murdoch poached James Warburton from Seven to run the network. And of course, we don’t know whether Murdoch and Gordon have even already come to an arrangement. But here’s my prediction: In the intrigues that lie ahead, News Corp will be the biggest winner. It always is. Tim Burrowes Tim Burrowes is the founder and content director of Mumbrella.

Does the 2 out of 3 rule still apply? And what are the implications for print and radio? Reply Tim Burrowes 8 May 17 Hi George, Thanks for the question. As I mention in the piece, the two-out-of-three rule would go. The two big players in print are News Corp and Fairfax. News Corp under its current ownership is not a seller of print (except for the Sunday Times in WA, and I suspect that made it easier to do a deal with SWM on Sky News ownership). Which leaves Fairfax. Much of that will be decided based on the outcome of the current TPG shenanigans. As for radio. I think that almost deserves a seperate piece. But the most interesting asset that might go into play would be the Fairfax-aligned Macquarie Media. On the one hand, a station like 2GB seems a great fit for News Corp, but on the other, I don’t think the company has ever shown much interest in radio assets. (Other than Lachlan’s successful personal investment in Nova of course.) Cheers, Tim – Mumbrella Reply Spelling Bee 8 May 17 “The principle losers on this will be Nine and Seven …” Are we to assume you mean “principal”? There are few “principles” in the world of the broadcasting business! Reply Tim Burrowes 8 May 17 Thanks Spelling Bee Duly fixed. Cheers, Tim – Mumbrella Reply Pedant 8 May 17 Separate. Reply Numbers 8 May 17 They key to media is content. If Murdoch gets FTA he can leverage his global content rights at low cost. Especially if he gets a bit more control of Foxtel. The newspaper businesses are still the primary sources of news content and if fairfax breaks up Rupert will completely dominate. The obvious missing reform was valuation of the FTA spectrum which is wasted in its present use. Reply csh 8 May 17 I think something you could have added to your article was a note that none of this is definitely going ahead – the whole package will need to get through the Senate. Govt needs ALP support (they’ve said they won’t support 2 out of 3 going) or most of the cross-bench (who may have some unexpected and undeliverable demands). I think there’s still a lot to play out here. Reply Bob Stone 8 May 17 Mumbrella jumping at media bogeyman. It’s 2017, not 1995 guys. Heard of Facebook and Google? Myopic, parochial analysis. Pretty disingenuous to claim it is ‘Lachlan’s Law”. Not only do Stokes, Fairfax and the entire industry support the package, but it leaves anti-siphoning intact, so not accurate to claim it’s a free-kick for News Corp. Reply Huh? 8 May 17 So Facebook and Google are substitutes for existing media? Earth to Bob Stone: get a grip. Reply Rob 8 May 17 <<>> This, absolutely. Also the fact that the majority of content the major network produce is utterly awful. The main point though, that News Corp and Rupert always wins – exactly right. It always does.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Companies Facebook, Google and Twitter sued by families of San Bernardino attack victims The families claim the firms allowed Isis to use social networks for spreading propaganda. By Sarmistha Acharya May 7, 2017 12:32 BST Tech firms sued for allegedly allowing Isis to spread extremist propagandaReuters/Patrick T Fallon Tech majors such as Facebook, Google and Twitter have been sued by family members of the three victims of the 2 December, 2015 San Bernardino shooting. They claim the companies allowed Islamic State (Isis) to spread propaganda freely on social media, provided material support to the group and enabled attacks like the one that took place in San Bernardino. In a complaint filed in the US District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday (3 May), seen by Reuters, the family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos alleged: "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group Isis with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits." "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of Isis over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint claims. Authorities said Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik, who killed 14 people and injured 22 others in the shooting, were inspired by Isis. This is not the first instance of tech firms facing a lawsuit. After the San Bernardino shooting, ranked as the deadliest attack by Isis in the US, in June 2016, an American-born man, who pledged allegiance to Isis shot 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In December the families of three men who died in the shooting sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in the federal court over charges similar to those of the California lawsuit.

Celcom will be the first Malaysian carrier to use Google Jibe RCS Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 8:32am PDTMay 6, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares147 Carriers Google News The first carrier to support Google's Jibe RCS technology was Sprint, back in November of last year. Since then, several carriers in Canada, Asia, and Europe have made the switch. Now it looks like Celcom will support Jibe RCS, becoming the first carrier in Malaysia to do so. If you need a refresher, RCS is designed to replace SMS, with features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing. Similar to different email services 'talking' to each other, different RCS clouds are inter-operable as long as they use the RCS Universal Profile. Thus, anyone on a carrier supporting Jibe RCS or another Universal Profile cloud can use the technology. Celcom did not provide a timeline on when Jibe RCS would be fully rolled out to its customers, but hopefully it won't be too long.

Malaysia related news. Finally, I'm out of US internet. Duder12 No good Android News sites in Malaysia? MrLockermanMY There is but it isn't as popular as AP. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing. I must share with you a job wherein all of tools is actually alloted to you and also it is a relatively easy in addition to really easy work. Not necessary to build your personal website domains and many more., all will be presented to you 100% free. Visitors definitely will browse the landing page so you are going to get compensated for that. Its as simple as that. I'm getting big profits from home from this work exactly like $20000 every month and sometimes more and if you also actually want to get paid same as that then follow these particular not very difficult directions by looking at this homepage .... ➤➤➤http:[email protected] ... Duder12 Fuck TMobile for delaying their rollout by switching to Samsung's RCS ProductFRED Samsung RCS works with Google's/Universal. It's just that they prefer Samsung's backend infrastructure for whatever reason. None of this makes a difference to the user experience. Duder12 Did you even read my post? I dont give a shit who they use. Fuck TMobile for **delaying** their rollout by ProductFRED I understand your frustration, but there's got to be a good reason for it. Also, as someone who uses multiple pieces of Google software daily at work (many of them enterprise-level), I can tell you that Google's products are in perpetual beta. They're buggy, and they change features every 5 minutes, and their Enterprise support kind of sucks. eddiepearson Wait what? Where did you read this? You have to be kidding right? We were supposed to get it like 3 months ago....What's the timeline now? If Sprint wasn't such crap, I'd switch in a heart beat. TMO is on thin ice with me. MJ Fucking Android Police... There is more to the world than Malaysia. Any news on the roll out of RCS in Uruguay? vzwuser76 And what about the 5G rollout in Atlantis? I guarantee Arthur Curry is feeling left out. AP really needs to expand their coverage. Borgman Can another answer these RCS questions.... Can I use Textra and someone else use a different SMS client, will RCS be working? As in 'reading, typing, etc' shows up. What about me using Textra and someone else using iMessage? And I just found out how much Allo compresses images (pisses me off), will RCS not compress since it's 10MB limit? Or will it still compress for some ungodly reason? What if Verizon uses RCS, but not the universal profile, will RCS still work for someone on verizon sending to Sprint? And would you have to use Verizon's messagin app for RCS to work? Is that a serious concern? Or will SMS clients (Textra) be able to implement RCS? Corbin Davenport As far as I know, Google has not released any kind of API for RCS, so Textra hasn't (and can't) add support until they do. I'm not sure about image compression. The Verizon/Sprint example you used wouldn't work, because Verizon's RCS implementation doesn't use the Universal Profile. I can't really answer the app question, but I do know that Android Messages supports more than just Jibe RCS. Vodafone is still using their own RCS implementation (that supports the Universal Profile), but that works with Android Messages. Borgman So if Verizon decides to use a different RCS profile, it won't work with ANYONE if they aren't on Verizon? :( Corbin Davenport Correct. Borgman Ugh that hurts. Big time. Ughhhh Eric Walker Does Verizon even have an rcs profilel? Last I checked they said rcs was stupid and made their own app. Jayson Stephenson That's just it. Verizon does utilize RCS (I don't know if you can call it a profile tho) but it's proprietary to people that are on their carrier only. And must use their messenger (Verizon Messages) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit#gid=0 Eric Walker Is that really even fit to be called rcs then? It sounds more to me like an instant messaging service like iMessage Jayson Stephenson Technically you would be correct. But it helps people that don't fully understand it know how it works. Eric Walker Also, wow. That's a great spreadsheet, it's cool that whoever made this has taken the time to get everything down in one place simply. Jayson Stephenson Thanks ;-) It's mine. Borgman That it the worst news lol. MUST use their messaging app and nothing else. Basically defeats the purpose of RCS across different devices and carriers. Jayson Stephenson Don't feel so down, once the API's are released and T-Mobile rolls-out RCS. Any other US-based carriers will start feeling the pressure from it's users not being able to utilize the neat features. I think it will happen sooner or later. senoredusty That's not a real concern though, as Verizon is one of the backers of the UP :-) it's just a matter of when Borgman Oh they are? I thought 'they've been silent' about RCS for a long time now. Hopefully they don't warp it and make their own profile and screw everything up! Jayson Stephenson Google is not the one we are waiting for to release any API's. It's the GSMA. http://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/universal-profile/ Which is stated to release Quarter two of this year (So between now and July 1st) MrLockermanMY does a mvno that rides on host network that supports rcs also supports rcs? Jayson Stephenson An MVNO can implement RCS almost the exact same way any other main carrier does. They have to sign-up on the cloud (Unless they create their own infrastructure which is super unlikely). http://www.mvnodynamics.com/2013/05/03/mvnos-can-benefit-from-rcs-too/ JG My understanding, if the parent network implements RCS on it's network, the MVNO(s) using the host's network will not automatically gain access to the host's RCS. The MVNO would have to set up their own RCS system, which they could do independent of their host. So an MVNO could have RCS even if it's host provider does not or presumably offer a different RCS. Which leads one to wonder... If Google is pushing all of these various carriers to support Google's own RCS standard... The obvious question.... Why doesn't Google's Project Fi support Google's RCS yet??? Especially with the running gag being that using Google products means we're beta testers... One might argue that Google's own carrier would have been the perfect testing ground for their RCS. A relatively small subscriber base (most of which probably with above average tech skills, able to cope with beta testing a new feature) with a limited number of supported devices... In @jaysonstephenson:disqus's linked article, it mentions RCS will work on cellular and WiFi data. If it accepts data from external, non-carrier controlled networks, then it, presumably at least, should be able to handle Fi's multi-carrier approach without too much issue. Jayson Stephenson You put it in better words than I could. I believe the reason why we don't see carriers like Project Fi or many MVNO's using RCS yet is because they are still using data from the MNO's tower's. I think if Project Fi were to get RCS they would have to get permission from the other 3 carriers to zero-rate the services so they can still use the "Unlimited Messaging" claim without it being deducted from our bill. MrLockermanMY thank you @JG42:disqus and @jaysonstephenson:disqus for explanation :) Nogib RCS on Sprint was great...right up to the point it stopped working beginning of April and I haven't seen it come back to my phone yet. :( aRvInD I'm surprised Indian carrier Jio will be using Tech edge always, but for messaging it never thought about RCS...!

It's not just among people following campaigns, but also among an unusually high number of people thinking about running for office. There's good reason. It's the modern equivalent of starting a tech company in the late 2000s--a play for power, where the odds are most favorable. The tech startup boom that began in the late 2000s and has tapered off over the past few years occurred because of a combination of technological, economic and demographic forces. The technological opportunity came about because of the simultaneous explosive growth in social media and the mobile Internet brought about by the development of smartphones. Facebook, Google and Apple may have created the dominant social and smartphone platforms that we all use today, but they weren't the only beneficiaries. Gaming companies like Zynga and King Digital, the makers of Farmville and Candy Crush; ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft; social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, and many other startups owe their existence to the growth of the social and mobile Internet. But all that technology didn't get created in a vacuum. The economic fallout from the great recession was responsible for stoking the entrepreneurial spirit of America as well. With the unemployment rate near 10 percent, and even higher for younger workers, the opportunity cost to take a shot on a startup was low. For entrepreneurs, post-recession office rents and salaries were low, allowing the money they raised from venture capitalists to go a long way. And for venture capitalists, tight credit conditions allowed them to get in on the ground floor of attractive startups at a low valuation. Still, none of this would have been possible without the people to make it happen. At this time, the biggest hump of the millennial generation, those born between the late 1980s and early 1990s, were entering college and the workforce. This provided a steady stream of young people--some interested in working on tech startups, many more interested in consuming their products and services. Startups are tapering off in part because the environment has changed. Rather than creating new platforms like Facebook did, upstarts now find themselves competing with the likes of Facebook, a daunting task. The economic expansion over the past several years has raised the opportunity cost for workers thinking about working for a startup; it's riskier to take a chance on stock options when large companies like Facebook and Google are offering attractive salaries. And entrepreneurs find themselves having to pay much higher office rents and salaries than they did in 2009 or 2010. For now, the social and mobile frontier may be closed. In 2008 a young person could envision striking gold with a tech startup. Now that seems implausible, but rising through the political hierarchy seems imaginable. In 2017 conditions are in place for an unprecedented surge in the number of people looking to run for office. Part of the attraction of running for office in 2018, at least on the Democratic side, is the high level of attention and financial engagement the party's base is showing already in the wake of President Donald Trump's election. Jon Ossoff, the first-time Democratic candidate in Georgia's sixth congressional district special election, raised over $8 million for the race's recently completed "jungle primary," with the race possibly on its way to being the most expensive congressional race ever. The vast majority of his money came from out of state, much of it raised via viral social media campaigns. Whereas in the past to run a successful congressional campaign a candidate may have needed a slew of local media and elected officials' endorsements, plus the financial backing of wealthy and powerful people in the community, today seemingly any candidate and campaign has the potential to catch fire and go viral nationally. There's a demographic component here as well. The same crop of people who were in their late teens and early 20s in the aftermath of the great recession are growing up, and are now old enough to run for office, like Ossoff, age 30--and their cohort could vote for them in the same way young people consumed the products of Zynga and Snapchat. At the same time, most of the elected officials and leaders of the Democratic Party are nearing retirement. Nancy Pelosi is 77. Bernie Sanders is 75. Elizabeth Warren is 67. If you're an ambitious person in your late 20s, what's more likely--that you disrupt the businesses of Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, or that you ascend through the ranks of the Democratic Party over the course of a few election cycles as the party's leadership retires and baby boomers shrink as a share of the electorate? Just as it's true that the tech startup boom minted only a handful of mega-winners, the same will be true for this electoral boom. But that doesn't mean these new political elites will be the only beneficiaries. There's only one Mark Zuckerberg, but Facebook created thousands of jobs and is a platform used by a billion people. A new civic wave might elect only a few dozen out of the hundreds who are running for national office, but a new generation can take comfort in knowing that its values will be the ones being heard in Congress rather than those of the current generation that can't seem to get anything done. The trend is clear. The new tech ruling class has already claimed its stake. But government? It's wide open.

To make my story short: There is absolutely no benefit Overclocking your CPU if you use your PC for Gaming in 4K or Gaming in less than 4K with 60Hz Monitor/TV. As you will see the single lower result is in CPU based Physics benchmarks, even API Overhead test has almost identical results. The reason I decided to do it is because I got tired of heat, its hot 9 out of 12 months over here so getting "free" heating is unnecessary, also I bet that my Overclocked PC with 1080ti, WC kit, 4 HDDS and 4 SSDs electricity costs are not cheap either and for nothing since I only game from time to time. My Next benchmark run will be testing if there is any Performance degradation under Windows 10 Pro when running with Hyper-Threading Enabled. Test System: Mobo: Asus Sabertooth X99 (Newest Bios:3505) RAM: 32GB 2666Mhz Enabled through XMP GPU: Gigabyte Aorus GTX1080 Ti Games and Benchmarks Installed to separate SSD Windows 10 Pro Creators Update, Game Mode Off, High Performance Power Plan. Before running the tests I used Display Driver Uninstaller v17.0.6.4 to clean up nvidia drivers and installed Driver v378.92 Display resolution and Benchmarks set at 3840x2160 GPU overclocked during both benchmark runs: Power Limit: 135%, Temp:90, Core: +60, Mem: +400, FAN: Locked @ 100% (Found out that keeping fan at 100% locked allows for cooler GPU and less/almost no throttling) During benchmarking the GPU was locked at 2000Mhz most of the time, sometimes doing 2025Mhz and sometimes 1985Mhz Intel 5820K @ 4.5Ghz, Hyper-Threading:OFF, CPU Cache @ 45, C-Staes Off, all Power Efficiency features Off in Bios.

Even with a GPU bottleneck at 4k, I'd bet you can still get a smoother experience with the CPU bumped up. You could go a bit further and set up a somewhat aggressive power plan in windows too. Power management is flexible enough that you can get the best of both worlds now. My chip jumps between 1.6 and 4.6 no problem. I'm pretty sure I could eek out a bit more framerate with the OC pegged at 4.6 but its not enough for me to abandon the power and heat savings.     haz_mat View Public Profile Find all posts by haz_mat   (#3) MegaFalloutFan Member Guru   Videocard: AORUS GTX 1080Ti Processor: i7-5820k @ 4.5Ghz Mainboard: Asus Sabertooth x99 Memory: DDR4 32Gb Soundcard: Creative Sound Blaster Z PSU: Seasonic Platinum 860W 05-06-2017, 04:31 | posts: 135 | Location: Desert Quote: Originally Posted by haz_mat I'd say to try to get your overclock stable with SpeedStep enabled.

PHOTO: AFP Attempts at cyber wire fraud globally, via emails purporting to be from trusted business associates, surged in the last seven months of 2016, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a warning to businesses. Fraudsters sought to steal $5.3 billion through schemes known as business email compromise from October 2013 through December, the FBI said in a report released Thursday by its Internet Crime Complaint Center. The figure is up sharply from the FBI’s previous report which said thieves attempted to steal $3.1 billion from October 2013 through May 2016, according to a survey of cases from law enforcement agencies around the world. Google warns users of massive Google Docs phishing scam The number of business-email compromise cases, in which cyber criminals request wire transfers in emails that look like they are from senior corporate executives or business suppliers who regularly request payments, almost doubled from May to December of last year, rising to 40,203 from 22,143, the FBI said. The survey does not track how much money was actually lost to criminals. Robert Holmes, who studies business email compromise for security firm Proofpoint Inc, estimated the incidents collated by the FBI represent just 20 per cent of the total, and that total actual losses could be as much as double the figures reported by the FBI. The losses are growing as scammers become more sophisticated, delving deeper into corporate finance departments to find susceptible targets, he said. “This is not a volume play; it’s a carefully researched play,” he said. Facebook, Google scammed out of $100 million The United States is by far the biggest target market, though fraudsters have started to expand in other developed countries, including Australia, Britain, France and Germany, Holmes said. The FBI has said that about one in four US victims respond by wiring money to fraudsters. In some of those cases, authorities have been able to identify the crimes in time to help victims recover the funds from banks before the criminals pulled them out of the system. The US Department of Justice said in March that it had charged a Lithuanian man with orchestrating a fraudulent email scheme that had tricked agents and employees of two US-based internet companies into wiring more than $100 million to overseas bank accounts. Fraudsters have also used spoofed emails to trick corporate workers into releasing sensitive data, including wage and tax reports, according to the advisory.

Riding through the streets of San Francisco, he occasionally taps or swipes his right hand over the left cuff of his jacket, as the directions he's listening to continually pop up on the screen of this advertisement. It's an ad from iconic US jeans maker Levi Strauss for Project Jacquard, an initiative with Google that the companies started two years ago for so-called “smart” denim. The future of the popular fabric was the focus at a recent international fashion fair in Paris – after all most believe the word denim derives from the French “serge de Nimes”, a serge from the city of Nimes. The fair featured many wearable innovations such as a waterproof jacket with sunscreen bands and a cable in the pocket to recharge a cellphone, or jeans that keep your body temperature stable. Once mainly the purview of athletic gear — with moisture-wicking shirts and trousers and then clothing that can track motion, heart rate, and body temperature — the new trend for fashion designers is to take everyday wear and transform it using new technologies. This is clothing made from specially woven fabric with touchscreen control capabilities that can be designed in such a way to visually stand out or go unnoticed depending on designers' wishes. French-based fashion company Spinali Design, for example, has created jeans that can give wearers directions without having to whip out the mobile at every single intersection. Through bluetooth sensors stitched into the jeans' waistband, the smartphone stays out of sight. “You put a destination into the pap (and) sensors will vibrate right if you need to turn right, left if you need to turn left,” Spinali innovation director Romain Spinali told AFP. In 2015, the company from the eastern French town of Mulhouse designed a bikini that tells women when it's time to apply more sunscreen. The two-piece retails for 149 euros (US$163) and comes with a small detachable ultraviolet sensor that, through a smartphone or tablet, sends a “sunscreen alert” when the sunbather's skin needs more protective cream. The detector is calibrated to the wearer's skin type and how much of a tan she wants to get, and is “virtually devoid of any radiation” Spinali said. The Spinali jeans, made in France, cost 150 euros and also have e-mail notification capabilities. “They will vibrate differently depending on whether the message received is from your family, your friends or work, in a way that you won't have to constantly check your e-mail on weekends or on vacation,” Spinali said. On their end, Google and Levi expect to release their denim jacket sometime this year, but it will come with a hefty US$350 price tag due in part to its special interactive fabric that allows the jacket's wearer to order various products online.   ENIVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS Other international fashion companies have also jumped on the “smart” denim bandwagon. Using thermo-regulated fabric and microfibre cloth popular in athletic wear, Brazilian textile maker Vicugna Textil has designed denims that will keep the wearer's core temperature stable. American designer Cone Denim for its part has blended its denims with technical textile fibres from equipment used on motorcycles — this to better tout the sturdiness of its clothes. But these companies recognise that there has to be more to “smart” jeans than just fashion sense and connected capabilities and that means making sure they are environmentally friendly. “The consumer demands greater traceability and ecology, especially when it comes to denim because it is a product that is a bit controversial,” said Marion Foret, fashion products chief for Premiere Vision Paris, which organises trade shows for the textile and clothing sector, including the denim show. Denim is a product “that doesn't always carry the best reputation, so textile makers are forced to use more ecological processes”, Foret added, such as making denims with organic or traceable cotton, cleaning denims without water, and using dyes that won't pollute the land. In keeping with that trend, Dutch fashion designer Pauline van Wongen makes denims using fabrics from used and already worn jeans. Others seek to keep consumers better informed like Pakistani manufacturer Artistic Fabric Mills which developed an application to retrace the history of the jeans. But for some young fashion students the future of jeans is not all about technology. “Connecting jeans to a smartphone is not necessarily what we want to have,” said Aurelia Martin, who studies fashion in Brussels. “There are problems that are a little more essential in terms of production, the dye, the cotton, the (jeans') pretty weak longevity, and the quality.” ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES 1.

The LG G6 is now on sale for $500 at T-Mobile. Pricing breaks down to $20 down and $20 per month for 24 months. The final $500 price is $150 less than the LG G6’s normal asking price. Folks that do buy an LG G6 from T-Mobile are eligible for a couple of gifts to go along with their new smartphone. First, LG is offering a free Google Home to consumers that buy an LG G6 before May 7, so you can score Google’s smart speaker with the purchase of a G6. T-Mobile has a free gift of its own to LG G6 buyers, offering a free LG G Pad X 8.0. To qualify, you’ll need to buy the LG G6 (or V20) on EIP and then get the G Pad X 8.0 on EIP as well. You’ll also need to sign up for a 2GB or higher mobile internet data plan. Once you do, T-Mobile will mail you a prepaid MasterCard card to cover the cost of the G Pad X 8.0 or whatever else you’d like to spend it on. There’s no word on how long this LG G6 sale will last, so if you’re interested in getting a discounted Android flagship, you may want to act soon.

Francisco Peña I’d rather they just give $200 in Play Store credit then.. App – Gift Temple Run 2 – Vault of Coins SpiderMan Unlimited – Black Rival bundle (3 costumes, 2 premium Gachas, 5 combo attacks, 20K coins and 85 cash Crossy Road – Deluxe Figurine Bundle (30 figurines) Genies and Gems – LG G6 Exclusive Coin & Booster Pack Cookie Jam – 1175 coins Sim City Buildit – Nice Pile of SimCash I’ve stopped playing TR2, Spiderman and Crossy Road and have no interest in the others. Brian Richards didn’t that phone JUST come out? Is it not selling very well in the shadow of the S8? Haze1nut The Galaxy s7 was launched with free netflix, VR, and a free S7 if you added another line. The S7 edge has been on sale most of its existence and its a high selling device. Promos =/= Low sales. Mike The Galaxy S8 is kicking the G6 azz at the asking price of $650 Francisco Peña I knew it would go down in price.. just thought it was a month sooner… Francisco Peña Wife needs a new phone, so will be heading out to get the LG G6 this weekend then. KOLIO It’s a nice phone,she should like it a lot,provided you’re not replacing an iPhone: Most long-time users seem to be leery of switching from it,even though in most instances it would be an upgrade (JMHO). Francisco Peña NonApple household. jroblopes not worth the risk of more problems with yet another LG phone. I’ve been burned 3x by LG and they are not a good company for service or warranty. LG will do anything to get out of performing warranty repairs on their flawed devices. The price mark down reflects this opinion. LG earned this reputation. No marketing will get them out of the bad reputation. Zacamandapio You’re almost there LG. jroblopes Just did a check to see where LG G6 is at with complaints: (It looks like the LG G6 comes with a 2 year warranty…. Good luck getting a 21 day turn around for any warranty work!) https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/lg-g6-problems/ https://www.technobezz.com/fix-lg-g6-lag-problems/ https://www.technobezz.com/common-lg-g6-problems-fix/ http://thedroidguy.com/2017/04/fix-lg-g6-wont-turn-troubleshooting-guide-1072151 https://recomhub.com/blog/how-to-fix-lg-g6-bluetooth-problems/ http://www.knowyourmobile.com/mobile-phones/lg-g6/24158/lg-g6-battery-life-test-not-good-i-was-hoping Mike Thaler Turn around on my G4 bootloop repair was 7 days. Gust Forget the monthly payment, just adds to the monthly bill for 2 years, stupid. I would bite at $350-400. Still too high. NardVa I knew the price was gone drop. Debating if I should wait for it to hit $400. Mike You probably can get a used one in the 400’s now. PiCASSiMO Remove the Google speaker (don’t need it), knock off another $100 and I will bite. HeatFan786 Just sell the speaker. I saw some on eBay on sale for like $140 or so. PiCASSiMO Doubt anyone will get $140 for it… selling for about $70-$75 on eBay: http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&_sop=15&LH_Complete=1&LH_ItemCondition=1000&_nkw=google%20home&_dcat=168058&rt=nc&Brand=Google thepanttherlady I agree. Just a quick Google search shows they’re selling brand new for less than $140. http://imgur.com/xZLX4OW HeatFan786 Market is flooded, so I take back the $140 rec. I would just price to sell asap at $70 or so if I am a person looking to get rid of it with the current promo. The first poster is right about asking to get $100 off instead. Saves the hassle and much more rewarding. riverhorse I’ll take the V20 @$480..besides cheaper, most specs are better / also comes with G Pad. G6 has been a huge flagship disappointment…high price n meh specs. Take another $200 off to get rid of it. Acdc1a V20 feels like a much larger phone. Not everyone is into that. I’m still sporting my Nexus 6 most of the time so I’m not in that group. Francisco Peña I passed on the v20 when it was $15 for that reason. Too large, even though I’ve got long fingers, it wasn’t comfortable in my hands, and after switching to usbC with my G5, I didn’t want to go back to micro USB for the S7 Benben Don’t buy any phones right now I was able to see the new payment plans and its going to be much cheaper Ron Kinsey When do you think the new payment plans will be out? Benben That I can not tell you All I know that the first 24 months is going to be 6-8$ and then you can trade for a newer phone or pay it off and keep it Ron Kinsey Sounds pretty good, though sounds to cheap for flagship phones. I did read something about that a day or so ago. Probably wont happen till the 3rd quarter. Sept or so. Peter Truong I think the new plan will be for T-mobile branded phone (HTC maker). Mike JOD u can upgrade three times within a 12 months . With this new plan seems like you’re stuck with the same phone until it’s paid off this is basically a weaker version of Jump with lower payments and no trade in’s for 24 months HeatFan786 So wait, if you’re on JoD already and within your 20 day return window, is it smart to do that? Or just do a JoD upgrade and then opt out of JoD within the return window? Bklynman Don’t need another tablet,already have the Gal.tab.A,from about 1 half ago,plus pick up Note 3 or Note 4 tab.from ebay,I could sell the Google home on ebay,and Lg Pad,get about $150-$200,for both,get pre-card,use that payoff the phone,then keep using my note 3,then sell G6 either on Swappa,or ebay too for anywhere from $250-$400. Then pay off the phone,walk away with $100-200.in my pocket,something to to think about. Adam I’ll wait for the removable battery option. I figure it will come out along with 600MHz support. David I have this phone , its pretty good but currently I’m paying $29 PM on JOD , would have been great deal for $20 JOD + google home don t With the 821 chip, lcd screen and lack of hifi, im afraid I’ll pass. I’ve got the ZTE axon 7. Incredible device. Fully loaded, and it’s better and faster than my pixel was and my S7 EDGE. I’ll wait for the S8. Acdc1a The device feels really great in your hand and the screen is beautiful despite being LCD. I don’t know that I’m a buyer at $410 (value of the Google Home device subtracted) but I think it’s a fine phone for the right buyer. William Kirschman Yes it does fit well in the hand. This phone just seems to be good all around and a steal at $500. The S8 looks great but not for $350 more and not without the dual camera. Mike Thaler My G4 had its bootloop fixed a few months ago (7 day turn around) – but phone started acting weird several weeks ago. Actually was thinking of V20. My take is the S8 is fine – just paying extra $ for the Samsung hype. G6 is a small step below the S8. (Screen, Processor). We were going to buy a Google Home. Tablet is of no value. So I figure G6 is costing us $400. S8 isn’t worth $350 more to us. I was hoping my G4 would last til the V30 comes out in the fall. JJCommonSense The V20 was a steal when TMO had it for $350 Mike Thaler I should have bot it. 64G internal memory and replaceable battery alone would do it now. I thought I could live w. my G4 til V30 in 6 months. Years ago had an HTC (which TM might carry again) but left them when they emulated Apple w. fixed battery. Now the V20 is virtually same price as G6. ($480/$500). NardVa Currently have a G4 that bootlooped back in December 2016. Got it fixed by LG and no problems since. Would love to get the G6 but not at $500. Probably sell the Google Home to get some of the $500 back. Klutz Ive been holding on to my Note 4 because of the removable battery and great screen. I dislike the edge style phones. Got the G6 2 weeks ago and it its pretty awesome. Screen isn’t as vibrant as an Amoled but it was only noticeable when I held them side by side. Most everything else about the G6 is great so far. And I love those dual cameras. Francisco Peña Well… problem solved.. my wife’s phone just bootlooped, and I managed to recover texts and backup the contacts (she didn’t save to google, just on the phone) via the blowdryer method. So new G6, here I come.. whether I wanted it or not.

Company Summary NSE BSE Pfizer Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Over $2.6 trillion is held as untaxed cash in offshore accounts by top US companies like Apple, Google, IBM, Pfizer, Pepsi and Coke, McDonald's etc according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for Tax and Economic Policy (ITEP). This is the highest-ever hoard held offshore by American companies and represents a net tax loss of a staggering $767 billion for the US government. The $2.6 trillion untaxed funds are more than the combined GDP of 153 countries, four times the US defence budget, and slightly more than the total mandatory spending of $2.45 trillion on social security, food security, medicare and unemployment by the US government in 2015. The untaxed treasure hoard is more than India's GDP. According to Richard Phillips of ITEP, this information was dug out from 10-K filings, that is, annual reports filed by companies with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Of the 500 top companies in the US, 322 were found to have large offshore holdings. How is it possible for companies to keep their profits abroad and evade taxes? The answer lies in a well-exploited loophole in the US tax code, says Phillips. "The US tax code has a provision, known as deferral, which allows companies to pay no additional US taxes on their offshore earnings until that money is repatriated.When it is technically repatriated, the companies have to pay the full US tax rate, minus any foreign taxes they have already paid," he told TOI. Eyeing this cash, President Donald Trump has proposed an amnesty scheme under which companies can bring back their offshore wealth by paying a one-time 10% tax. The going rate for corporate taxes in US is 35% and, so, a huge concession is being offered. President George W Bush had granted a similar amnesty in 2004 with a onetime tax rate of 5.25% only. However, it was thought to be a failure with companies hoarding more cash abroad hoping for tax holidays. Phillips thinks the best policy to end this hoarding of cash would be to require companies to pay US tax immediately on their offshore earnings, rather than allowing them to defer these taxes as under current law. Without the incentive of tax avoidance, companies would simply stop hoarding their cash offshore, he said.

Celcom will be the first Malaysian carrier to use Google Jibe RCS Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 8:32am PDTMay 6, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares147 Carriers Google News The first carrier to support Google's Jibe RCS technology was Sprint, back in November of last year. Since then, several carriers in Canada, Asia, and Europe have made the switch. Now it looks like Celcom will support Jibe RCS, becoming the first carrier in Malaysia to do so. If you need a refresher, RCS is designed to replace SMS, with features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing. Similar to different email services 'talking' to each other, different RCS clouds are inter-operable as long as they use the RCS Universal Profile. Thus, anyone on a carrier supporting Jibe RCS or another Universal Profile cloud can use the technology. Celcom did not provide a timeline on when Jibe RCS would be fully rolled out to its customers, but hopefully it won't be too long.

Duder12 Fuck TMobile for delaying their rollout by switching to Samsung's RCS ProductFRED Samsung RCS works with Google's/Universal. It's just that they prefer Samsung's backend infrastructure for whatever reason. None of this makes a difference to the user experience. Duder12 Did you even read my post? I dont give a shit who they use. Fuck TMobile for **delaying** their rollout by ProductFRED I understand your frustration, but there's got to be a good reason for it. Also, as someone who uses multiple pieces of Google software daily at work (many of them enterprise-level), I can tell you that Google's products are in perpetual beta. They're buggy, and they change features every 5 minutes, and their Enterprise support kind of sucks. eddiepearson Wait what? Where did you read this? You have to be kidding right? We were supposed to get it like 3 months ago....What's the timeline now? If Sprint wasn't such crap, I'd switch in a heart beat. TMO is on thin ice with me. MJ Fucking Android Police... There is more to the world than Malaysia. Any news on the roll out of RCS in Uruguay? vzwuser76 And what about the 5G rollout in Atlantis? I guarantee Arthur Curry is feeling left out. AP really needs to expand their coverage. Borgman Can another answer these RCS questions.... Can I use Textra and someone else use a different SMS client, will RCS be working? As in 'reading, typing, etc' shows up. What about me using Textra and someone else using iMessage? And I just found out how much Allo compresses images (pisses me off), will RCS not compress since it's 10MB limit? Or will it still compress for some ungodly reason? What if Verizon uses RCS, but not the universal profile, will RCS still work for someone on verizon sending to Sprint? And would you have to use Verizon's messagin app for RCS to work? Is that a serious concern? Or will SMS clients (Textra) be able to implement RCS? Corbin Davenport As far as I know, Google has not released any kind of API for RCS, so Textra hasn't (and can't) add support until they do. I'm not sure about image compression. The Verizon/Sprint example you used wouldn't work, because Verizon's RCS implementation doesn't use the Universal Profile. I can't really answer the app question, but I do know that Android Messages supports more than just Jibe RCS. Vodafone is still using their own RCS implementation (that supports the Universal Profile), but that works with Android Messages. Borgman So if Verizon decides to use a different RCS profile, it won't work with ANYONE if they aren't on Verizon? :( Corbin Davenport Correct. Borgman Ugh that hurts. Big time. Ughhhh Eric Walker Does Verizon even have an rcs profilel? Last I checked they said rcs was stupid and made their own app. Jayson Stephenson That's just it. Verizon does utilize RCS (I don't know if you can call it a profile tho) but it's proprietary to people that are on their carrier only. And must use their messenger (Verizon Messages) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit#gid=0 Eric Walker Is that really even fit to be called rcs then? It sounds more to me like an instant messaging service like iMessage Jayson Stephenson Technically you would be correct. But it helps people that don't fully understand it know how it works. Eric Walker Also, wow. That's a great spreadsheet, it's cool that whoever made this has taken the time to get everything down in one place simply. Jayson Stephenson Thanks ;-) It's mine. Borgman That it the worst news lol. MUST use their messaging app and nothing else. Basically defeats the purpose of RCS across different devices and carriers. Jayson Stephenson Don't feel so down, once the API's are released and T-Mobile rolls-out RCS. Any other US-based carriers will start feeling the pressure from it's users not being able to utilize the neat features. I think it will happen sooner or later. senoredusty That's not a real concern though, as Verizon is one of the backers of the UP :-) it's just a matter of when Borgman Oh they are? I thought 'they've been silent' about RCS for a long time now. Hopefully they don't warp it and make their own profile and screw everything up! Jayson Stephenson Google is not the one we are waiting for to release any API's. It's the GSMA. http://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/universal-profile/ Which is stated to release Quarter two of this year (So between now and July 1st) MrLockermanMY does a mvno that rides on host network that supports rcs also supports rcs? Jayson Stephenson An MVNO can implement RCS almost the exact same way any other main carrier does. They have to sign-up on the cloud (Unless they create their own infrastructure which is super unlikely). http://www.mvnodynamics.com/2013/05/03/mvnos-can-benefit-from-rcs-too/ JG My understanding, if the parent network implements RCS on it's network, the MVNO(s) using the host's network will not automatically gain access to the host's RCS. The MVNO would have to set up their own RCS system, which they could do independent of their host. So an MVNO could have RCS even if it's host provider does not or presumably offer a different RCS. Which leads one to wonder... If Google is pushing all of these various carriers to support Google's own RCS standard... The obvious question.... Why doesn't Google's Project Fi support Google's RCS yet??? Especially with the running gag being that using Google products means we're beta testers... One might argue that Google's own carrier would have been the perfect testing ground for their RCS. A relatively small subscriber base (most of which probably with above average tech skills, able to cope with beta testing a new feature) with a limited number of supported devices... In @jaysonstephenson:disqus's linked article, it mentions RCS will work on cellular and WiFi data. If it accepts data from external, non-carrier controlled networks, then it, presumably at least, should be able to handle Fi's multi-carrier approach without too much issue. Jayson Stephenson You put it in better words than I could. I believe the reason why we don't see carriers like Project Fi or many MVNO's using RCS yet is because they are still using data from the MNO's tower's. I think if Project Fi were to get RCS they would have to get permission from the other 3 carriers to zero-rate the services so they can still use the "Unlimited Messaging" claim without it being deducted from our bill. MrLockermanMY thank you @JG42:disqus and @jaysonstephenson:disqus for explanation :) Nogib RCS on Sprint was great...right up to the point it stopped working beginning of April and I haven't seen it come back to my phone yet. :( aRvInD I'm surprised Indian carrier Jio will be using Tech edge always, but for messaging it never thought about RCS...!

May 6, 2017 8:15 PM   Subscribe I picked up this poster at an antique shop. It appears to be a joke about a fake auction sold at a curio shop called Bloch Mercantile in San Francisco around the 1920s. Is there anything else you can tell me about the shop, or about what this poster means? Amazingly, there's very little Google-able information about this thing, but here's what I've found so far: * The poster references Bloch Mercantile Co, which was a curio shop on Market Street in San Francisco in the 20s. There's a picture of the store here. This article about something else from Bloch shed some more light on what the store was and who frequented it. * I can't find the exact wording of this poster anywhere, but there are a few similar examples in newspaper archives and elsewhere online, most notably this one. These are what lead me to think this is a joke (in addition to the obviously joke-y names), but I can't tell where it originated or even what's supposed to be funny about the whole thing. I still have a lot of questions I'm hoping someone can answer. What is the joke here? Where did this come from? What was Bloch Mercantile Company, and what else did it sell? Any light you can shed on this thing's context would be super cool. posted by Apropos of Something to Society & Culture (17 answers total) 8 users marked this as a favorite   This is exciting. So, it's a fake/satirical auction sale notice. Auction notices were extremely common in print products up through, really, the 60s and maybe longer in rural areas. They were commonly submitted to and printed in newspapers, as you found - and I also found random phrases in other newspapers like this, so for certain it was a squib circulated in journalism circles and reprinted all over because, presumably, people could understand the humor and find it funny. Here's another version, from 1916, that seems to be presented as college humor. Since it is printed by E. Bloch Mercantile, which seems to be an importer/exporter, maybe it was meant as a humorous ad for their services? The earliest one I found was from 1913, so it dates back a ways, but I also found one from 1940, meaning it's a chestnut. It seems to make fun of farms going bust, resulting in an auction, and the periodic cyclical farm and financial crises that were dirt-common until we had a social safety net. The language seems like the idea is to sucker in city people looking to make a score but not knowing a lot about rural life, who'd accept these descriptions without realizing they're silly. For instance, something like "seven dapple grey chickens" would make a livestock raiser laugh, since you'd never describe chickens as "dapple grey" - that's a horse description. I also think I see traces of sort of a society dealing with technological change - like, the specs are mixed-up, some appropriate to basic farm equipment, some to newer gasoline-powered machinery, and some to fashion and food. So it sort of speaks to a moment in which consumer choices and advertising are proliferating and the language pertinent to each sale area is starting to jumble in the imagination. Maybe it also pokes fun at people ignorant about rural things. The names "I. Holdem" and "U. Socem" are puns about taking advantage of consumers, on the order of the Tappet Brothers' "Dewey, Cheatham and Howe" law firm. Beyond that, I can't contextualize that much. You've found something interesting and it appears to have had a widespread existence as a popular and common humor meme. If I were to pursue it would contact historians of journalism and advertising. posted by Miko at 8:53 PM on May 6 [15 favorites] Those are nonsense items and names. This auction wouldn't have ever happened. If you have some familiarity with farming or older tools, you'll catch some of the jokes. (Some are pretty funny!) -Bulls are boys, cows are girls. 7 milk cows 2 of which are bulls is nonsense. -poland China is a pig breed, not a cow breed -fell pony (not cow!) Is a breed of pony, "that never fell" is a play on words etc. The names I. Ketchum (I catch them) We Holdem (we hold them) and U Sockem (you sock them) are probably a joke about catching con artists. posted by windykites at 8:58 PM on May 6 Yeah, when I think about it, what's going on between 1900 and 1940 is that the US is shifting from a majority-rural to a majority-urban population. IN 1870, 1 out of 4 Americans lived in a rural household. By 1900, 2 out of 4 did - a 100% increase. In the decade 1940-1950, that went up to 2/3. So I think one of the underlying sources of humor is that people were becoming less and less literate with the language and rituals of country life. It's an auction notice full of B.S. and puns and nonsense and counterfactual things, but thrown out there in the confident tone of someone with mastery of content. I think they're sort of playing on the city slicker vs. rootsy country guy dichotomy, here. It captures a moment where knowledge of rural things is starting to matter less, and there are more and more citified people that would, in the joke, be unable to recognize how silly and BS this all is. I'm still kind of stuck on the "plan to commit suicide" angle. These notices commonly appeared after a farm owner's death. There's something interesting about the notion of planning ahead for it. And maybe it fits into the pretty classic folklore trope of having a country person get one over on a supposedly smarter city slicker - like, I'm going to sell all this before I'm dead instead of after, and convince you it's worth a lot using my fancy language, and cash in and laugh all the way to the bank. posted by Miko at 9:09 PM on May 6 [3 favorites] Here's as many more as I can figure: Calves dont have pups, and the weather wouldn't influence what day they did, Leghorns are a chicken breed, not a pig breed, and pigs don't have long golden hair growing down their backs, A wood saw doesn't need instructions, I don't know if triple extension bicycles existed but I'm sure they didn't have patent (leather) jeweled levers, (Not sure about the plow) I doubt a dung fork could have a useful fly net, but I'm sure they wished to could, I don't think you can trot, pace, or gallop a wheelbarrow, Horses are dapple grey, not chickens, Olive chilled plow with velveteen flounces- why would you chill a plow or put flounces- on it? Flounces go on dresses. (Dunno about a jassac) Double breasted is a type of jacket, not cupboard. All baking ovens would have likely been "stationary" except Dutch ovens Bob sleds aren't mechanical, they don't need automatic cutoffs of anything Cross eyed fountain pen for a left handed person... Come on... Canine constructed on the Hibernian plan (in the Hibernian style) I guess means an Irish setter? No such thing as a "Willie" goat and goats dont have red whiskers "a-la-mode" (in the modern style, or, with ice cream?) and certainly can't be made to work in teams, And if you were going to commit suicide you sure wouldn't put it on an auction flyer. Not sure what the sale time means. posted by windykites at 9:14 PM on May 6 [1 favorite] Anyways, I think it's just a silly thing someone did for laughs. I don't think there's a big deep meaning to it. People have always liked to troll. It's funny because it's absurd. posted by windykites at 9:20 PM on May 6 [1 favorite] Not sure what the sale time means. There's a humor in just saying "next week" or "Eleven AM PDQ" because, like, when? It's an auction, so you have to be there at the precise day and time in order to buy anything at all. So I think that's part of the joke. But I don't quite get "froze to death" and the rest. It really is in soooo many newspapers - this thing was widely printed. I found a bunch more searching on "bulltoad road." Each phrase I search yields a different newspaper version. posted by Miko at 9:26 PM on May 6 Okay, cool. I'm glad I'm not the only one who finds this interesting. But I don't quite get "froze to death" and the rest. Is there something in "froze to death" being part of Oh, Susanna, given that that's also kind of nonsense-y? posted by Apropos of Something at 9:31 PM on May 6 Poland China is also a pig, not a cow. posted by Miko at 9:33 PM on May 6 But I don't quite get "froze to death" and the rest. A sideways reference to the Year Without a Summer. posted by Knappster at 9:34 PM on May 6 I doubt it; that was two generations earlier. posted by Miko at 9:37 PM on May 6 Some Google-investigating of the full phrase "1900 and froze to death" suggests that it's a not-very-common bit of vernacular, a way of humorously saying "a long time ago but I'm being intentionally vague about the exact date." Possibly originating as a reference to the winter of 1918, which was supposedly especially harsh. posted by soundguy99 at 10:00 PM on May 6 [1 favorite] Ah, looks like that's referring to 1816, the year without a summer, "(also the Poverty Year, the Summer that Never Was, Year There Was No Summer, and Eighteen Hundred and Froze to Death)". posted by moonmilk at 5:51 AM on May 7 And I see knappster got there first! posted by moonmilk at 5:52 AM on May 7 soundguy99, good sleuthing. After poking around Google Books and some idiom sites, it's clear that "1900 and froze to death" can be the equivalent of "Since God was a boy" - eg, a way of colorfully saying "a really long time ago." Or also an indeterminate time: I found a citation from a 1913 convention of factory inspectors who were saying they needed some sort of resolution or legislation and "we can't wait until 1900 and froze to death before we get it." A pretty witty saying when you think about it. I think I'll start using it! posted by Miko at 6:53 AM on May 7 [2 favorites] And (further poking), even though a lot of time had gone by, moonmilk and knappster are right about the connection to the year 1816. Through the later 19th century people started referring to that year as "1800 and froze to death," and it looks like people who grew up hearing it transitioned easily to updating it for "1900 and froze to death." posted by Miko at 6:58 AM on May 7 [2 favorites] Cross eyed fountain pen is likely a joke about Cross pens. posted by zamboni at 7:47 AM on May 7 It might be a pun on Cross pens, too, which is funny, but I think another thing at play is that "handedness" and left-handedness being not only OK but having products designed for it was a relatively new concept at the end of the 19th century, and it was really progressive educators like John Dewey and people like that who promoted it. So, you now had a bunch of common household and school items like scissors and tools that newly came in left- and right-handed versions. posted by Miko at 8:09 AM on May 7 « Older Chicagoland Dog Behaviorist Recs   |   bounded compassion among buddhists Newer » You are not logged in, either login or create an account to post comments Related Questions Stores in San Francisco November 17, 2015 Fun 1-hr activities around the bay area?

The Hollywood Reporter Movies TV Business Style Politics Tech Culture Awards Video Sites Heat Vision Live Feed Esq The Race Behind the Screen Bastard Machine Rambling Reporter The Fien Print Subscribe Site Tools Newsletters Daily Edition Behind The Screen Digital Power YouTube CEO Apologizes to Advertisers: "We Can and We Will Do Better" 5:00 AM PDT 5/5/2017 by Natalie Jarvey FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of Getty Images YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki In her NewFronts pitch, Susan Wojcicki directly addressed the backlash by top brands over some ads appearing next to racist or offensive content. In the years since YouTube held its first Brandcast pitch to advertisers in New York, the Google-owned streamer’s message has gotten increasingly easier to sell: What brands wouldn’t want to pay for access to YouTube’s influential set of homegrown stars and its more than 1 billion users?  But at the Javits Center on Thursday night, it was time for the streaming giant to issue a mea culpa. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart, Dish and several other big brands had all previously announced plans to suspend their advertising from YouTube following reports that their ads and others were appearing alongside violent, inappropriate or racist content.  "The last couple weeks have been challenging for some of you," CEO Susan Wojcicki acknowledged to the room full of advertisers early during YouTube's hourlong presentation. "I want you to know that we have taken your feedback to heart. We work hard every day to earn our advertisers' and agencies' trust. We apologize for letting some of you down. We can, and we will, do better." YouTube had already apologized for the issue and said that it was going to change its policies to monitor content. It also previously announced plans to give advertisers more control over where their ads go. But the controversy still loomed large over the annual event, part of the two-week pitchfest called as NewFronts, where YouTube is known for throwing one of the most lavish parties. (Past performers have included Sia and Bruno Mars.) Throughout the NewFronts several digital companies took aim at YouTube by discussing their platform's "brand safety," including Conde Nast Entertainment, which promised that advertisers would know exactly what they were getting when they advertised on its portfolio of brands like Vogue or GQ.  But YouTube has the scale that many of the NewFronts presenters will never reach, and after her apology Wojcicki made sure to remind the Brandcast audience of that. She rattled off several stats about the streamer, including that there are 75 percent more channels with over one million subscribers than there were last year, and that watch time of TV channels on YouTube has grown by 50 percent. Wojcicki also highlighted Google Preferred, a program that allows advertisers to buy against the top 5 percent of channels on YouTube, which gives brands more control over where their ads go and has recently been expanded into more than 20 countries.  The presentation then proceeded to make the case that YouTube is a better buy than television. "YouTube is not TV and we never will be," she proclaimed, noting the diversity, authenticity and community of endemic YouTube creators. "Our users don't come to YouTube for polish. They come for texture."  Filmmaker and vlogger Casey Neistat, who it's worth noting recently sold his company to CNN and is building a new digital business with the cable news network, came onstage to share his experience with YouTube. Halfway through the talk he literally dropped his microphone on the ground, saying "my hand is old media ... and the floor is YouTube."  But YouTube does still seem to be chasing television when it comes to original programming. The streamer announced a slate of seven new, ad-supported originals from a mix of traditional stars with big YouTube channels like Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart and digital talent like Rhett & Link — all which will help YouTube target the advertising dollars that have traditionally flown into television. The projects are already winning over brands. The company announced that Johnson & Johnson — which previously told The Times that it was suspending its YouTube advertising — would sponsor Ryan Seacrest-produced competition series Best.Cover.Ever. YouTube not only used Brandcast to smooth things over with advertisers, but also with creators. The company's annual Creator Summit, held the same week as Brandcast, turned into an opportunity for it to address YouTuber's questions about declining revenue following tweaks YouTube made to its ad products in response to advertiser concerns. Sources tell THR that the issue was top of mind when creators spoke to Wojcicki on Wednesday ahead of Brandcast, but that the conversation was ultimately open and productive. And YouTube — whose parent company Alphabet just reported revenue increases of 22 percent to $24.75 billion during the first quarter of the year — didn't seem to have any problem packing hundreds of buyers and media executives into its Javits Center event Thursday night, which featured appearances by James Corden and Kevin Hart and a surprise performance by Katy Perry.    FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Natalie Jarvey Natalie.Jarvey@thr.com NatJarv Comments comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter © 2017 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Not at the plate, where his batting average is .246, certainly not indicative of the lasers he has been spraying around the field early on this season. No, Castellanos is going through an early season slump at third base, where defensively, he hasn’t been making the kind of plays he’s been expected to after such an improvement last season and this spring. “Just a little bit of a slump,” Ausmus said. “Defensive slumps happen. They don’t happen as often as offensive slumps, but they do happen.” Castellanos committed his sixth error of the season in Friday night’s win over the Athletics. In 2016, he committed nine total errors, though that campaign was shortened by a six-week injury.

Have the same confidence despite the recent struggles.” The view from the press box is this: Castellanos’ defensive strides last season, and certainly this spring, were real. They will show up soon enough. For some time, he has made most of the necessary plays at third base. The same could not be said this season, too often botching routine plays. He’s shown improved range and should snap out of the defensive slump sooner rather than later. Contact Anthony Fenech: afenech@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @anthonyfenech.

Every nation prefers to think of itself as productive, in the sense of hard working and smart, not just fertile. What makes America great? The standard answers to this question point to qualities that the United States is said to have in greater abundance than its peers in Europe and Japan. There are the innovations that pour out of Silicon Valley companies and Ivy League schools, the flexibility of a work force relatively unconstrained by unions, the dynamism of entrepreneurs less hamstrung by an oversize welfare state, a mobile population willing to move to cities where cutting edge jobs are mushrooming. In short, the standard flexibility theory of American exceptionalism is all about qualities that make workers more productive. Today , nearly all the discussion about how to make America great again focusses on ways ­ like cutting red tape and taxes ­ to revive flagging productivity growth. Though this discussion remains critically important, it downplays a big shift. The underlying growth potential of any economy is shaped not only by productivity , or output per worker, but also by the number of workers entering the labour force. The growth of the labour force is in turn determined mainly by the number of working age people and of immigrants entering the country.Over the last two decades, the US advantage in productivity growth has narrowed sharply , while its population advantages, compared to Europe and Japan, have held steady. What makes America great is, therefore, less and less about productivity than population, less about Google and Stanford than about babies and immigrants. The growing importance of the population race will be hard for any politician to accept. Every nation prefers to think of itself as productive, in the sense of hard working and smart, not just fertile. But population is where the real action is. I found, comparing six of the leading developed countries ­ the US, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and the UK ­ that in recent decades productivity growth has not only been slowing across the board, but that the gaps in productivity growth between these rich nations are also narrowing sharply .Before 2010, productivity was growing much faster in the US than in Germany or Japan, but that advantage has largely disappeared since. The reasons for this convergence are complex, including the rapid spread of technology across borders, but the trend spans the developed world. This should raise doubts about how any one country can regain a distinct economic advantage by focussing only on reviving productivity. Like productivity, population growth has been slowing worldwide, the big difference being that the gaps between rich nations are widening. In the 1960s the US population growth rate (including migration) was 50% higher than Europe's and about the same as Japan's. By the end of that decade, population growth peaked worldwide, but it has slowed very unevenly. Since 2005, America's population growth rate has been eight times higher than Europe's, and Japan's population has not grown at all. Increasingly, then, the underlying difference between the fast and slow growing economies is explained more by the differences in population growth than productivity . In fact, since 2005, per capita GDP has grown on average by 0.6% a year in the US, exactly the same rate as in Japan and virtually the same as the Eurozone. In other words, if it weren't for the boost from babies and immigrants, the US economy would look much like those supposed laggards, Europe and Japan. Moreover, breaking down population growth, immigrants have a surprisingly big impact. In the US, immigrants have accounted for a third to a half of population growth for decades. In other Anglo-Saxon countries ­ Canada, Australia and Britain ­ immigrants have accounted for more than half of population growth over the past decade. Those economies have also been growing faster than their counterparts in the rest of Europe or Japan. But much of that advantage would also have disappeared without their population advantage. Politically, the irony of this moment is stark. Population growth is increasingly important as an economic force and is increasingly driven by immigration. Yet now, along comes a new breed of nationalists, rising on promises to limit immigration. And they have been especially successful in countries where immigration has been especially important to the economy, including the US and Britain. History is littered with examples of emerging nations that have failed to generate enough jobs for a booming young population. But virtually no nation has ever sustained rapid economic growth without strong population growth. Today, when every major country including the US faces continued decline in population growth, workers are an increasingly precious source of national economic strength. Consider this: if, over the last two decades, the population of the US had been growing as slowly as Japan's, US share of the global economy would be just 15%, not the 25% it holds today. It would be unrealistic to imagine that hard economic logic will turn the anti-global, anti-foreign tide any time soon. The likely result is that the US and Britain will go ahead and limit immigration. To the extent they do ­ and their rivals do not ­ they will undermine their key economic edge, and cede much of the growth advantage they have enjoyed over Europe and Japan. {The writer is an author and global investor. © 2017 The New York Times (distributed by The New York Times Syndicate)} Comments(0)Add Comments View: American exceptionalism is less about Google and Stanford, more about babies and immigrants To post this comment you must Log In/Connect with:Indiatimes Network or Fill in your details: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed Share this Comment:Post to Twitter Also Read Recent violence in US not indicative of whole country: Former Stanford dean Martin Walsh Apollo Hospitals inks pact with Stanford University Stanford scientist believes the end of sex for reproduction is coming Stanford University announces Knight-Hennessy scholarship program READ MORE ONUSStanfordimmigrantsGooglebabies Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App.DOWNLOAD NOW FROM AROUND THE WEB 10 Indian Divas Who Never Got Married CRITICSUNION Profitable option in Bangalore property market Property Share Best Luxury Senior Living Apartments in Clifton Luxury Senior Apartments - Sponsored AdsMORE FROM ECONOMIC TIMES Seven Indian-origin people who made it big on a global scale 6 interesting things about the new UP CM, Yogi Adityanath Actress Kalpana given state funeral, celebrities pay homage From Around the WebMore from The Economic Times 9 Worst US States To Retire Due to Taxes, Living Expenses,..

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Guest How chatbots transform how we work Rick Nucci, Guru@ricknucci May 7, 2017 10:19 PM Last year I talked about how Browser Extensions are changing the way we work. The ability to reduce the number of places we need to go during our work day can directly improve company performance metrics and help business scale faster and more efficiently, all while creating a better experience for your customer. Some examples include: – Minimizing the time it takes to reply to a customer support issue reduces your issue resolution rate and improves NPS. – Answer prospect questions without leaving your inbox. The faster you can respond to inbound leads, the more likely you are to connect. – Know when your prospects are engaging in the content you send them to better understand their interest. Slack launched their platform in December 2015, allowing anyone to develop a bot on top of Slack. Since then, the number of bots for the workplace has exploded, creating a robust ecosystem of ways to work faster and more efficiently. Additional platform offerings were announced as well from Facebook, Microsoft, and most recently Google, creating the potential for a good ecosystem of new bot-driven experiences at work. Like browser extensions, bots live where you work, providing exciting new ways for teams to transform the way they work. Bots are not without their challenges Bots are steeped in the upward slope of the Hype Cycle these days, and many like to talk about the failure of bots. However, when you boil down most of the negativity, it has more to do with the scope of the problem, rather than the bot itself. For example, we can’t (yet) expect a bot to “replace” a human. And, while I won’t conjecture whether or not that will ever be possible, the fact of the matter is that most bots don’t succeed because they go far too wide on the problems they are trying to solve. Because bots rely on NLP (natural language processing), like other fields of AI, you are only as good as your training data. There is a direct corollary between the breadth of the problem you want to solve, and the amount of high quality training data you have access to. Many of us have probably experienced the limitations of some sort of broadly defined “personal assistants”. We try to treat the bot like an assistant, and then it doesn’t work, and we get mad! It’s not the bots fault, even though I want to blame “it”. It’s a mile wide and an inch deep problem, where the bot just doesn’t have a chance for success because it is being asked to do too many things. Much like a human and the way we learn, we don’t simultaneously try to teach ourselves to code, to sell, to do customer support, etc. We tend to optimize and get really good at a relative few things. Same idea with bots. Bots in the workplace are already working But in the workplace, it’s a different story. The approaches being taken with bots that help us do our jobs better are already showing early signs of success. Why? For decades enterprise software has been seen as the “ugly and hard to use” kind of software, always desperately trying to compare itself to “beautiful and easy to use” consumer software. And it’s this reality that actually makes bots an immediate success in the workplace. Think about the enterprise software you use today to do your job. And the bigger the company you work at, the worse it is! The products are confusing, hard to use, slow, etc. Now imagine a bot that allows you to complete a task in a fraction of the time it normally takes, without leaving Slack, in a few keystrokes. The value of the bot here is the comparable experience; you are taking a task that was long, distracting, and unpleasant into one that is a much better, faster simpler experience. And this is the opportunity that is so exciting. Think about all those different tasks across the workplace where this “before and after” opportunity exists. It’s everywhere right? Everything is up for grabs, again. In the early 2000’s everything started changing in the enterprise software world with the move to the cloud. Company workflows all got rewritten as vendors could now offer their customers a simple web browser experience. Compared to the on-premise, client server alternative they were used to, this new world of SaaS “just worked”. Oh and upgrades “just worked” as well. There are still to this day many enterprises stuck on old unsupported software stacks because they were customized in a one off manner, in such a way that they can never be upgraded without major surgery to critical company business processes. In the SaaS world this was not possible. You had to productize the ability to customize so that it worked across all your customer channels. Very hard to do, but once done, there’s a massive upside on the other end as you can just keep releasing upgrades and your customers get the benefit immediately. However, while we certainly improved the user experience in this last rewrite, we didn’t make it that much better. Many of these SaaS apps are still complex, with many modules and features that only grow more complex over time. While we did get good at “productizing customization” as mentioned above, it came at the price of bloating the UI’s of those SaaS apps, with more and more features getting added over time, and an ever growing checklist and options to choose from so you can accommodate an ever growing customer base. So what if there was no “UI”? What if you didn’t have to use these interfaces at all? What if you could have a simple conversation to accomplish your task? So something like filing a receipt for your expense report is as simple as uploading a picture to your Concur expense bot. Need to update your pipeline? A simple conversation with the Troops bot and you’re done. Does your team run daily standups? Let the Standuply bot take that over, and replace the manual process of asking for updates, capturing notes, and sending them out. These examples are all real, working bots. You can try them today. The other important thing you will notice as you try some of these things out is they are very purpose built and narrowly focused on improving a specific workflow. As mentioned above, this is an important success factor. These bots are taking a few workflows, and really working to make them much better experiences. I think it’s an exciting time. Just like with the move to the cloud, once again all of these workflows are being rewritten again. This time, we will see a dramatic change in the user experience. Combining bots with AI brings our daily tasks right into the places we are already working, it guides us through what we need to do proactively, and helps us get answers to questions that previously would require huge manual effort across numerous internal systems.

On May 5, Russia’s internet regulator Roskomnadzor published a list of prohibited online services that included WeChat, the popular Chinese chat app. Some users in Russia reported they could no longer use the app as usual, according to Russian tech site VC.ru. An official on a Tencent microblog reportedly apologized to affected users. In a statement to Quartz, Tencent said that as an entity involved in “online information distribution,” it was required to provide Russian authorities with information when requested. “We are in discussions with relevant authorities regarding the situation,” it said, without elaborating further. A spokesperson for Roskomnadzor told AFP that the agency blocked WeChat because it did not provide its “contact details” to the register. However, the true cause of the block likely lies in a Russian law passed in 2014 requiring all foreign internet companies to store Russian user data on servers located inside Russia, a requirement China has also imposed. To date, few major internet companies have complied with the requirement and have faced no consequences as a result. Google and Facebook remain unaffected by the law and continue to operate normally in Russia as they do in most other countries. But not every company has gotten off easy. In 2016 Russian authorities blocked access to LinkedIn, which at the time had 6 million users in the country. In March, Roskomnadzor told media that LinkedIn submitted a letter to the agency saying it had no intentions of storing domestic user data on domestic servers, which “confirmed its lack of interest in working with the Russian market.” It also tweeted out a message announcing LinkedIn’s “death” in Russia. R.I.P. https://t.co/g9st9q3PDW pic.twitter.com/S0sqCunlQa — Роскомнадзор (@roscomnadzor) March 7, 2017 Since then, Russia has acted more aggressively against foreign internet companies operating in Russia. Early last week it published a notice announcing that several chat apps, including Blackberry Messenger and Japan’s Line, had been blocked. The WeChat block in particular rings of irony, since China itself is known for imposing tough regulations on foreign internet companies, and enforcing them with ever more vigor. Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter, which operate in Russia largely without issue, remain blocked in China primarily due to qualms about freedom of information. Over the past few years the Chinese government has also blocked Instagram, Snapchat, Flickr, Line, Dropbox, iCloud, Pinterest, and several established news media, like The New York Times. In recent weeks, ahead of a major Communist party conference in the fall that will shape the future leadership, China has issued new requirements related to online news publishing and said it will exert more control over search engines. Meanwhile, the Chinese government, much like Russia, has required foreign companies to keep local user data inside the country’s borders. For the most part, younger companies have obliged, perhaps wary of a swift strike against them if they resist. LinkedIn, Uber, and AirBnb have each committed to using domestic servers to store Chinese user data. Amid this, Chinese president Xi Jinping has justified the policies under the slogan “cyber sovereignty“—the notion that nation states should have the authority to govern the internet as they see fit, rather than respect it as a transnational highway for spreading information and commerce. Of course, just because China and Russia share a similar philosophy about internet governance doesn’t mean that they will roll out the red carpet for each others’ internet companies. Governments that rally for an internet with borders (or “splinternet”) ought not be surprised or dismayed when their firms get shut out of the market, with or without good reason. With the WeChat block, China is merely getting a taste of its own medicine.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 May 2017 | MYT 11:44 AM US far-right activists, WikiLeaks and bots help amplify Macron leaks Twitter declined to comment on whether it had taken any specific action in response to the Macron leak. Pictured are French nationals living in Australia. — Reuters WASHINGTON: US far-right activists helped amplify a leak of hacked e-mails belonging to leading French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign, some researchers said on Saturday, with automated bots and the Twitter account of WikiLeaks also propelling a leak that came two days before France's presidential vote.  The rapid spread on Twitter, Facebook and the messaging forum 4chan of e-mails and other campaign documents that Macron's campaign said on Friday had been stolen recalled the effort by right-wing activists and Russian state media to promote hacked documents embarrassing to Democratic US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton last year. It also renewed questions whether social media companies have done enough to limit fake accounts or spammed content on their platforms and how media organisations should report on hacked information. Twitter declined to comment on whether it had taken any specific action in response to the Macron leak. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Analysis conducted by The Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab published on Saturday found that the hashtag #MacronLeaks reached 47,000 tweets in three and a half hours after it was first used by Jack Posobiec, a writer in Washington for the far-right news organisation The Rebel. Posobiec's online biography said he coordinated grassroots organising for a group that supported US President Donald Trump's campaign. Posobiec's initial tweet on the Macron documents was retweeted fifteen times within one minute and 87 times in five minutes, Atlantic Council senior fellow Ben Nimmo wrote in a blog published on Medium. Posobiec is prolific on Twitter, where he has a large following of more than 100,000 accounts. Contacted by Reuters, Posobiec said he did not operate bots and that he used his account to share a post he saw on 4chan. Bots helped move the hashtag from the United States to France, according to Nimmo, where surveys show far-right leader Marine Le Pen trailing Macron by more than 20 points heading into Sunday's election. French electoral law forbids candidates from commenting during Saturday and until polling stations close on Sunday. WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group that published hacked e-mails belonging to Democrats during the 2016 presidential election, provided the largest boost of attention on Twitter to the Macron emails, Nimmo said. The group did not publish the information itself but tweeted about the leak at least 15 times. "As the dominant publication in the field we were hours ahead of all other major outlets," WikiLeaks said in a private Twitter message to a Reuters reporter. "That's what our readers expect." Difficult to attribute Some researchers also observed the use of identical phrasing in blogs about the leaks, which they alleged was aimed at driving Alphabet Inc's Google search result rankings. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. About nine gigabytes of data purporting to be documents from the Macron campaign were posted on Pastebin, a site that allows anonymous document sharing. Other recent high-profile political leaks, including those during the US presidential election, have often been dumped by WikiLeaks, which has a sizeable online following and international recognition. "There is a noticeable lack of a persona taking credit for this," said John Hultquist, a cyber researcher at FireEye, adding that such an absence made attribution more difficult. The US cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint told Reuters late Friday that an initial review of the Macron leaks indicated that APT 28, a group tied to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence unit, may be behind the leak, though evidence was not yet conclusive. Among other indicators, the firm said metadata contained in one of the leaked files showed it had been modified by someone who works in the technology industry in Moscow. But other cyber researchers said that analysis was premature, and western security officials contacted by Reuters were cautious about assigning any attribution. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied accusations it has attempted to use cyberattacks to meddle in either the French or US elections. The Macron leaks prompted swift alarm in the United States, where many believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was again trying to put his thumb on the scales of a Western election. US intelligence agencies concluded that Putin ordered the hacking of Democratic e-mails during the US election to benefit Republican Trump, who has been at times dismissive of those findings and resurfaced his claim earlier this week that China could have been responsible. US Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement to Reuters that the Macron leak demonstrates the urgency of his panel's investigation into Russia's alleged interference in last year's US election. Noting the Macron dump may contain fake documents mixed in with authentic material, as some analysts have suggested, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the leak may represent "yet another dangerous escalation of cyber interference in a Western nation's democracy." — Reuters   Related Stories You May Be Interested New phone?

GDP is down, employment is up. Apple confounds the analysts with a financial report worthy of corporate envy, but the analysts were not happy, and seem to blame Apple for the analysts bad guesses! And then there’s printing shipments: let’s change the subject… it seems many printers are doing just that by changing the process. Do policies in your company insulate you from the detection of market changes and opportunities? It’s not always denial, it’s procedure. That’s not a good thing. By Dr. Joe Webb Published: May 8, 2017 Gee, the Economy is Slow... … but if you’ve been following this column and the webinars, you’re not surprised. Real GDP for the first quarter came in at +0.7%, lower than economist estimates and lower than trend. We prefer to look at the year-to-year comparisons rather than quarter-to-quarter, and to also look at the data without inventories. The fluctuations in inventories can make the underlying pattern in the data harder to see. Indeed, there was an inventory correction in the last quarter, and taking that into account the economy is still in the unsatisfying +2% range.  For those who like to compare how their business is doing against the economy, to equal GDP you need to grow at the rate of about +4.25% unless you adjust for inflation, and that would be about a +2.2% growth rate. Our recovery indicators had a slowdown in two of its six factors. The one item to be concerned about is our small business indicator or proprietors’ income, up +1.3% at an annual rate, which is actually negative after you subtract inflation. The NASDAQ is probably overdone in relation to various economic but its driven mainly by Apple and FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google). Much was made about the NASDAQ being at all-time highs, but it actually needs another 500 or so points for it to be there after inflation. A while ago we showed that investing in the NASDAQ starting at its true peak on a dollar-cost-averaging basis, ignoring dividends, through all those years of decline and its slow rise, the average annual return was 8%. It’s yet another case of ignoring the indexes and avoiding the quest for “the right time” to invest turning out better than it seems. Printing Shipments: Should “Everyone” be Worried? March shipments were not good. March has a history of being the best month of the year or among them. On a current dollar basis, it was barely over $7 billion, down more than $500 million compared to last year. That’s a -6.7% decline, and -8.9% after factoring in inflation. The negative pattern really got going with September’s shipments. The chart shows the period of October through March for the last five years. The latest period is down -4.9% in current dollars and -6.9% adjusted for inflation. I’ve been poking around the industry over these last weeks, and looking at various data sources. There are businesses doing well, absorbing the volumes of their deceased and struggling brethren, and the stream of “tuck-in” activities. It does seem that big and long-run printers are having another round of demand declines. Because they still represent a large share of industry shipments, declines there may overstate what small and mid-size print businesses are going through. It’s in those sectors of the market where I get positive reports from data-immersed digital printing operations. Traditional offset operations are in more trouble lately than they already were. There is the question about whether print in general is having problems, or if volume is just going elsewhere like corporate offices (no, more digital communications), inplant departments (many are closing, others are changing their services and print offerings), office superstores (many stores closing or about to), copy shops (not growing here either), and other places.  This is a chart of the year-to-year percentage change in CPI-adjusted US paper shipments. It’s not the best measure because it includes all paper, not just paper used in printing, but it does show that the value of shipments has been contracting every month since Spring of 2015. The steadiest sector of commercial printing has been screen printers. For some of the projects we’ve been working on lately, we’ve actually had to exclude the screen printing data from the industry wide data to work through the details of our analysis because it’s been so resilient compared to the rest of the industry. A lot has to do with their adoption of ink jet processes like wide format for some of their applications, but also because many corporate communicators are staging events and using with a lot of branded promotional goods. As for offset taking it on the chin, many of the digital printing businesses are doing better. Digital print smartly mingles in the expanding culture of marketing automation and analytics. These businesses should not be worried, but they should stay out in front of the trends. Everyone else should be worried, perhaps. The next big date for shipments data is May 18 when the Commerce Department issues revisions that may date as far back as but probably as far back as 2013. Revisions to other data series seem to indicate that the statisticians are raising 2015 and lowering 2016 data. All of this activity leads to revisions to historical GDP at the end of July. Managers can’t wait for the statisticians to get 2014 right. They have to make decisions about today. Employment Continues an Upward Muddle; Printing Consolidates The press made a big deal about payroll increasing by +211,000 after a bad prior month that was revised down. Long-term payroll employment is still mired in the +150,000 to +175,000 range, which affirms a slow and sluggish economy.  The unemployment rate fell to 4.4%, but as we have written previously that is no longer a good measure of the health of the labor market. What was good news, not reported, of course, was that full time employment was up by +480,000, and the household survey of all jobs was up by +314,000. Therefore, about 166,000 part time positions were replaced by full time ones. That tempered some of the negative aspects of the report, such as -162,000 leaving the workforce, one of the factors that nefariously improves the unemployment rate calculation. For the last 12 months “no longer in labor force” has averaged only -28,000 per month, so this reading was considerably higher. The labor participation rate, which is where we will see true labor market improvement (if and) when it occurs fell back to 62.9%. It’s been range-bound between 62.4% and 63.0% since April 2014. When the recession started it was 66.0%, more than nine years ago.  Commercial printing employment is down -10,500 workers since last year (-2.3%) and is now at 437,700. Non-production workers continue a general long term trend of declining faster than production workers (-2.2% vs. -2.8%), mainly the result of consolidation whether acquisition or closure. Growth in public relations employment looks like it's topping out, perhaps the result of more companies taking charge of their content marketing initiatives by bringing it inside and hiring freelance writers on their own. Ad agency employment is up, in recent months. Graphic design employment seems to be in growth mode again. Data, Expectations, and Reactions Apple’s financials were interesting, as usual, but what always fascinates me is the reaction of the markets and the stock analysts. The company’s stock price is often penalized because the analysts make incorrect guesses about the company’s sales and costs and seasonal patterns. Their same silly act goes on every quarter. Does your business run on hard data or guesses? Every manager has rules of thumb or assumptions based on their experiences, but these stock analysts seem to be in a much different place. As managers, when our rules of thumb or assumptions are not correct, our interest is piqued, and we find out what’s different. The stock analysts seem to blame Apple for not meeting their analyst numbers. That’s strange. Remember, as managers, we look at economic data because they are available, and we want a sense of whether what we are seeing is what’s happening elsewhere. What we do with our own businesses and our own customers and prospects is what really matters. Strongly held assertions create opportunities when businesses and their executives stick with their assumptions even though realities indicate otherwise. This creates a misallocation of resources and opportunities for competitors. One might say that about entrepreneurship. There is a strongly held assertion about an opportunity in the marketplace that others cannot see. But even entrepreneurs allow for those risks and the natural lag before data start to affirm their direction. The real problem is in larger businesses where there are organizational territories to protect and procedures and policies that reinforce out-of-date market assumptions. Yes, that’s you, company bonus and commission programs, built on existing products and capabilities that put blinders (sorry, I meant to say “encourage people to focus like laser beams on their jobs”). When marketplaces change, one of the first places that problems arise is in the compensation of bonused and commissioned workers. Sales fall, so those workers and top executives focus more on the jobs and customers they know. Difficulties in making forecasts are blamed first on the quality of the efforts and skills of those workers. By the time the business realizes that something else is the cause, they have already wasted time and resources trying to solve a problem for which they did not diagnose a proper cause. Yes, people need to focus on their jobs, but they also need to be encouraged to learn things from their interactions with the marketplace. They might not be able to interpret them, but they need to be able to report them to management. Both sides need to make sure that the information is not an excuse for poor performance but data that when added with other news and information helps management do their jobs better. Sometimes sales problems are sales problems, but sometimes sales problems are the company producing and selling the wrong things. Many printers and businesses misdiagnose changes business levels as fluctuations in general economic conditions. Media markets are changing: be aware and open to the reasons why and the extent of those changes, and what opportunities and challenges they bring to your business and your staff.

I was particularly excited as I’d managed to scorch myself the previous day and thought I’d try it as a sunburn remedy. Funny how things don’t always go according to plan... The first challenge was to try to actually manage to yank up a leaf, away from the scrutiny of the omnipresent security guards. It certainly wasn’t just like picking a daisy. But I did it! Then, back in the room, quite proud of my endeavours, I tentatively sliced the end off with a dinner knife. It looked okay to me. A bit fleshy and nondescript really. I left it on the table while I went to get something. On my return, however, something rather alarming had happened. My previously innocent-looking Aloe Vera leaf had unexpectedly morphed into something that would not be out of place in a sci-fi horror movie – curling up alarmingly and spewing evil-looking bright yellow sticky liquid everywhere…. with a matching indescribably evil smell as a surprise added bonus! ‘You’re not putting that on your back are you?’ said Mike nervously. Undeterred, I soldiered on, following instructions on Google and YouTube and deftly scooping out the clear, greenish flesh with a teaspoon. The smell was showing no signs of abating – imagine cheese and onion crisps mixed with fish gut – and the yellow liquid was now also making impressive psychedelic, possibly indelible, patterns all over the white marble table top. My fingertips now looked like I’d been a heavy smoker of roll-ups since I was a teenager. The hotel – with its white bedspread and fluffy white towels - would love me. I gave up. We bundled ‘Vera’ into a carrier bag and, under the cover of dusk, made a furtive trip to the dustbin two floors down and vowed never again. I’ll stick to the green goo you buy in Boots from now on. JUST A SIMPLE ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT Last week Buckingham Palace declared it was making ‘an announcement’. The entire royal household’s staff were assembled, the world’s media waited with baited breath. Britain debated what could possibly make such a newsworthy impression. Clearly no-one of eminence had popped their clogs as there was no TV blackout and solemn music. Was the Queen abdicating? What could warrant such a major staff meeting? Mystery solved. Prince Phillip is ‘retiring’ at the age of 96. I really like Prince Philip and his stoic refusal to bow to political correctness. But surely just a simple announcement without any preamble would have been sufficient. SERVICE WITH A SMILE? IT WAS MORE LIKE SERVICE WITH A SNARL Yesterday in the supermarket I was served by a rather surly young lady who clearly would have preferred not to be there. She barely managed a word and did everything without eye contact. I’d obviously interrupted her ‘deep and meaningful’ with a neighbouring cashier. How very rude of me! Service with a smile? More like service with a snarl. A similar experience happened the other week with a cashier with a somewhat ironic badge proclaiming her name was ‘Joy.’ Now they may have had things going on in their lives to make them less than cheerful. But surely leaving a positive – or at least, a neutral – impression is part of what they’re being paid for. A little pleasantness wouldn’t go amiss.

Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM news.com.au May 8, 20172:44pm Video Image Apple shares fall on surprise dip in iPhone sales1:24 Apple has reported a surprise fall in iPhone sales for its second quarter, indicating that customers may have held back purchases in anticipation of the 10th-anniversary edition of the company's most important product later this year. David Pollard reports May 3rd 2017 5 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products in Cupertino, California on Wednesday, May 3, 2017. Picture: Marcio Jose Sanchez ARTIFICIALLY intelligent home speakers who talk to you and carry out internet-based tasks at your behest are the new big thing in consumer tech. And Apple is expected to finally join the party in the coming months. According to a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (dubbed the “best Apple analyst on the planet” by some), the tech giant is tipped to launch its own version of a smart home speaker with its famous AI assistant Siri at your beck and call. The report speculates that Apple will position the device as a more premium product than others on the market with superior acoustics and computing power, and a higher price tag to match. KGI’s report was reticent to speculate on an exact release date but said it could be as early as next month. Meanwhile Melbourne-based Apple leaker Sonny Dickson has predicted the company would launch the Siri speaker at its annual developers conference in early June, for the device to go on sale in the second half of the year. Apple has been working to majorly overhaul Siri and it's capabilities, for all devices, but most notably their upcoming smarthome device.— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) May 1, 2017 The potential home speaker — the likes of which are designed to be the focal point of a connected lounge room — would directly compete with Amazon Echo and Google Home which have carved out a dominant stake in the emerging market. And this week, we got a hint that Apple’s potential offering might look rather different to the home speakers put out by Google and Amazon. A young boy plays with an Amazon Echo. Picture: Ian CurrieSource:News Corp Australia Google Home had a strong focus on design.Source:AP In an interview with Gadgets360, Apple executive Phil Schiller espoused the benefits of having a voice-controlled smart assistant which includes a screen in the design — a feature missing from the Amazon Echo and Google Home speaker. “There is a lot of talk in the industry about voice-driven assistants and we believe deeply in voice-driven assistants that’s why invest in Siri,” he said. But the senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple said in terms of user experience, he didn’t think such products functioned optimally without a screen. “There’s many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn’t mean you’d never want a screen. So the idea of not having a screen, I don’t think suits many situations,” he said. “For example if I’m looking for directions and I’m using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that’s really convenient but it’s even better if I can see that map.” Apple’s developers conference, known as WWDC, will take place on June 5 to 9, 2017 in California.

We can't solve this problem alone so we are supporting third party fact-checkers during the election in their work with news organisations, so they can independently assess facts and stories.” READ NEXT WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for May 8 WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for May 8 By WIRED Subscribe to WIRED These third-party organisations include Full Fact and First Draft and, under this partnership, Facebook said it will work with journalists to address rumours and misinformation spreading online during the UK general election. Google has also signed up to this partnership, and more details will be announced “in due course.” Educational adverts From today, a notice will be shown across Facebook news feeds in the UK with ten tips on how to spot false news. This builds on the eight tips unveiled in April which include checking dates, URLs and sources. All 10 tips can be found in Full Fact's toolkit. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Monetising misinformation: inside the fake news capital of the world Monetising misinformation: inside the fake news capital of the world By Samanth Subramanian Removing fake accounts Facebook claims that since April it has removed “tens of thousands of fake accounts”, but would not be drawn on an exact number. The site said it's made improvements to recognise fake accounts faster and more easily by identifying patterns of activity, without assessing the content itself. For example, Facebook said its systems may detect repeated posting of the same content or an increase in messages sent. “With these changes, we expect we will also reduce the spread of material generated through inauthentic activity, including spam, misinformation, or other deceptive content that is often shared by creators of fake accounts,” the site said. Informed sharing Facebook is changing the way it ranks stories though what it has dubbed Informed Sharing. “We’ve found that if reading an article makes people significantly less likely to share it, that may be a sign that a story has misled people in some way,” the site said. For example, people sharing an article without clicking on it could be a sign that it's a false story (or the headline is potentially misleading.) Alternatively, if people are clicking on the link and choosing not to share it, a red flag is raised. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT From Doctor Who to ordering pizza, our pick of the best bots From Doctor Who to ordering pizza, our pick of the best bots By Libby Plummer Facebook did not go into detail how this would work but it is likely to expand on its clickbait ranking update, introduced in August. Under that scheme, articles with headlines that don't tell the reader the full story – those leaving a 'curiosity gap' – are penalised by the system that ranks posts by Pages. The headlines are used by publishers to entice readers to click on an article's link to find out more; registering the page view for advertising revenue. According to Facebook, examples of clickbait headlines include: 'When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions And Saw THIS… I Was SHOCKED!' and 'He Put Garlic In His Shoes Before Going To Bed And What Happens Next Is Hard To Believe'. Facebook began tests to incorporate the latest "fake news" signal into its rankings in December, specifically for articles that are outliers where people who read the article are significantly less likely to share it, and is now expanding this to Great Britain. Facebook Journalism Project These UK-focused changes will join the online initatives including the Facebook Journalism Project, set up to offer "deeper collaboration" with news organisations.

These come with a certificate curriculum. Facebook also offers training for local newsrooms with Knight Foundation, Detroit Journalism Cooperative, Institute for NonProfit News, Local Independent News Online (LION) and Institute for Journalism in New Media. Facebook has been on the defensive in recent months. Following the furore surrounding Donald Trump's presidency, the site was accused of being explicit in helping spread fake news about the US presidential election. More recently, it's faced scorn for the way Facebook Live is being used to broadcast murders and suicides. As a result of the latter, the site announced plans to hire 3,000 extra moderators to track offensive content. This will bring the team total to 7,500. “Over the last few weeks, we've seen people hurting themselves and others on Facebook – either live or in video posted later," Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. "It's heartbreaking, and I've been reflecting on how we can do better for our community.” The team looks at reports of hate speech and child exploitation, two issues the social network has been under pressure to dramatically improve upon. Zuckerberg added that Facebook needs to respond faster to reports, and is building new ways to make reporting simpler, and the review process faster. ADVERTISEMENT Elsewhere, Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, recently announced a community-driven online news service in response to the widespread distribution of deliberately misleading information masquerading as news. Jimmy Wales goes after fake news with Wikitribune – a crowdfunded site for reporters Jimmy Wales goes after fake news with Wikitribune – a crowdfunded site for reporters Wikipedia 24 Apr 2017 The project, Wikitribune, is a hybrid model in which paid journalists work with a broad network of contributors. “We want to bring some of that fact-based, fact-checking mentality that we know from Wikipedia to news,” Wales told WIRED. Wikitribune will be financed through a crowdfunding campaign that will determine the size of the initial team. “Humans haven’t fundamentally changed from the way we were 100 years ago or 500 years ago,” Wales continues. “People have a thirst for quality information.” He describes the core editorial mission of the platform as “facts matter” and intends that the site will be able to support “original reporting and investigative journalism”.
