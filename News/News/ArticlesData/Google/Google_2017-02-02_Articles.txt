Under the terms, Snap is required to spend at least US$400mil (RM1.77bil) a year on Google cloud services. A portion of these payments can be delayed, during the first four years of the deal. In return for this commitment, Snap said it will get discounted pricing from Google, without being more specific.  The deal is a big win for Google’s cloud division, which under Diane Greene, is trying to catch leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp. Snap was an early customers of Google’s cloud services, and the social media company remains one of its largest spenders, people familiar with the companies have said. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology You May Be Interested New York sues Charter, alleges Time Warner fraud on Internet speeds Indian IT firms to meet Trump officials on visa reform concerns Snap signed five-year, US$2bil deal to use Google’s Cloud Here’s Apple’s challenge in India Facebook, Microsoft said to circulate immigration open letter Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

The BRC-Google Online Retail Monitor for the fourth quarter of 2016 found that the volume of overseas customers making online searches for UK retail brands was up by 23% across all devices in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the same time in the previous year. Search volumes on mobile devices were up by 16%. Martijn Bertisen, retail director at Google [IRDX VGOO], said: “Overseas interest in UK brands was up 23% in the last quarter of 2016. Foreign exchange rates have continued to position UK brands favourably internationally, with particularly strong growth from our European neighbours. “Slowing tablet sales has meant that increased demand is largely coming from smartphones, with triple digit growth observed in some regions. In this mobile-first world, having a great user experience is crucial for our retailers. A recent Google study found that only five of the top 20 UK retailers’ mobile sites load in less than two seconds.” The most popular categories that overseas shoppers looked for via mobile were apparel (+64%) and beauty (+50%). The strongest interest came from Croatia (+106%). At home, said Bertisen, searches were directed towards consumer electronics across all categories. “Driven by Black Friday and Christmas deals, UK consumers still demand the latest product releases and tech gadgets,” he said. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium [IRDX VBRC], said: “Digital continued to play a pivotal role in driving sales for UK retailers in the final quarter of 2016. In December, the online penetration rate for non-food remained above 20 per cent for the fifteenth consecutive month and the channel won its greatest share of Black Friday and Christmas sales to date. It is no surprise therefore that today’s figures, which show high double digit growth of mobile search volumes across most UK brand categories, are consistent with this trend. “At home, the top trending searches reveal that seasonal occasions and events prompted the highest volumes of browsing activity. Meanwhile, the attention of overseas consumers was drawn to the apparel and beauty brands which demonstrated the strongest growth in category searches on a mobile device, with an impressive 64 per cent and 50 per cent increase respectively. “This quarter’s figures provide further evidence that the EU is an increasingly important market for UK retailers and that consumers from the continent are increasingly likely to be experiencing the British retail offer through their smartphones. The challenges and opportunity for UK retailers to capitalise on this rapid growth persist and British businesses remain focussed on tailoring their ecommerce offer to utilise the strength and popularity of UK retail beyond our own borders, which shows little sign of diminishing.” Mentioned in this piece… Google IRDX: VGOO Google is an American multinational corporation specialising in Internet-related services and products.

Sign up now Menu ARN Snap is paying Google $400M a year for cloud services Snap is paying Google $400M a year for cloud services Snap has agreed to a minimum annual cloud bill roughly equal to its 2016 revenue Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 03 February, 2017 16:16 - - - - print email Comments Over the next five years, the company behind Snapchat will pay Google at least US$2 billion in cloud bills. On Thursday, Snap revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it signed a five-year contract to pay Google at least $400 million a year for cloud services. That's a steep figure, considering that Snap made roughly $404 million last year.  In return for the massive commitment, Snap will receive reduced pricing, though it’s not clear how deep the company’s discounts will be. Sinking a bunch of money into Google Cloud makes sense, because Snapchat began its life built on top of Google’s AppEngine platform-as-a-service offering. Furthermore, Snap’s commitment to Google is a massive vote of confidence in the latter’s cloud capabilities, at a time when there’s heavy competition in the cloud market. Right now, Google’s cloud is an underdog compared to Microsoft and Amazon. But being tied to a rising star in the social media landscape like Snapchat could help draw other companies to at least give Google’s platform a chance. However, the contract is not without risk. If Snap doesn’t use $400 million worth of Google Cloud services in a year, it’s still on the hook for the full value of the contract. What’s more, the company said in the filing that it uses Google for the “vast majority” of its “computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” If something goes wrong with Google Cloud, or if the tech titan gets out of the public cloud business, it could be bad news for Snap. That last scenario seems highly unlikely, considering that Google continues increasing its investment in its cloud platform. Urs Hölzle, Google’s vice president of technical infrastructure, said last year that the company plans to launch new cloud data centers at the rate of roughly one each month this year. All of this is tied to Snap’s plans to pursue an initial public offering in the near future. The filing released on Thursday is one of the company’s steps along that path. Snap’s IPO is being closely observed by the tech industry because of the company’s high-flying status. It remains to be seen how Wall Street will receive the company, especially since it’s far from profitable and its losses have widened year over year. Plus, the deal with Google means that Snap will be saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in liabilities for the foreseeable future.

According to Brand Finance’s Global 500 2017 report, Google’s brand value surged as much as 24 percent last year to $109.4 billion. Cupertino-based Apple’s brand value, however, fell 27 percent to $107.1 billion, and it dropped to the second place. “Google remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income,” the report said. The Google brand benefitted from the numero uno position it enjoys in the maps space, and its other products—Android, Chrome and YouTube—also retained their individual brand value. However, the report also mentioned that Google is attracting scrutiny over the erosion of personal privacy and potential monopolistic behaviour, and that a mono-branded approach here may not work in its favour. Google had made attempts to move away from this approach in 2015 when it went through corporate restructuring and became a division of new parent Alphabet. Diversifying its brand portfolio helps Alphabet avoid excessive scale and divert regulatory attention, mentioned the report. On the other hand, Apple has “failed to maintain its technological advantage and repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected,” the report said. Other top brands Tech brands continued to enjoy superlative brand value, followed by the banking sector, telecommunications, retail and auto. E-commerce firm Amazon was third ($106.4 billion) on the list, followed by telecom company AT&T ($87 billion), which came in fourth. The fifth position was held by Microsoft ($76.3 billion), followed by South Korean electronics giant Samsung, telecom firm Verizon, US-based retailer Walmart and social media company Facebook. Amazon’s brand value grew 53% in 2016 as it continued capturing market share in several geographies. Facebook saw 82% growth in brand value, but Chinese tech brands Alibaba, WeChat and Tencent grew faster at 94%, 103% and 124%, respectively. Like this report?

For more on the Marshmallow leak, take a look at this full rundown from XDA-Developers. It reviews the update’s early performance. For a set of photos, take a look at these Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow photos. Verizon’s run down of the Marshmallow update will also give you a feel for the changes.

These issues have extended to the Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.o.1 update. Verizon users are already starting to complain about battery drain, Wi-Fi problems and more. We expect complaints to pick up as the roll out picks up speed. It’s not clear how these problems will impact the overall speed of the roll out (it doesn’t appear to have slowed it down yet) but Galaxy Note 5 users will want to be cautious when Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow arrives.

Samsung Galaxy S7 Marshmallow Update As expected, the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge both run the company’s Android 6.0.1 software. The two devices run a unique version of the operating system. You can get a feel for their version of Marshmallow software in the hands-on video above. It’s worth noting that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge do not support Android 6.0’s Adoptable Storage feature, a concern given the fact that it only comes with 32GB of internal storage space in the United States.

The company’s official Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android Nougat roll outs have begun though the release is limited to select models in select regions around the world. We expect that to change soon. Samsung’s promised several Nougat updates in the first half of 2017 and we expect all of these upgrades to deliver new features, tweaks and fixes for lingering Marshmallow issues. For more information on the Android Marshmallow’s successor, take a look at our Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat roundup and our Android Nougat walkthrough. Samsung’s Android Nougat update will bump devices from Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0. It’s not clear when or if Samsung will bump its devices to Android 7.1.1, the most up-t0-date version of Nougat. 10 Things to Do Before Installing Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow Get Familiar with Android 6.0.1 & Marshmallow   1 / 10 Let's start with something very important.  One of the first things you'll want to do is get familiar with the changes coming with your version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Each update is going to be a little bit different (carriers can't help themselves) but there some core elements to each.  There are a number of resources around the web but we'll provide you with some great starting points right here.  We've taken a deep dive into the differences between Lollipop and Marshmallow and you'll want to check the basics out so that you're comfortable with the changes.  Android 6.0.1, the version of Marshmallow rolling out to Galaxy devices, is a little different than Android 6.0. You can get familiar with some of Android 6.0.1's basics right here. And then we get to the device level. That is to say that the Galaxy S6 Marshmallow update is a little different than the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update. We've outlined some of those differences and you can find them at the links provided.  Things will be different at the carrier level as well and you'll want to look into those changes as well.

The hype and the hype over a few stupid changes is crazy. You guys in the media have to stop making things bigger than what they are, When a MAJOR change occurs, then hype and push it. Marshmallow is not a big deal. 01/12/2016 mnet Reply Marshmallow is hug Ben. It is huge because of the features you will get to control app permissions. The “wild west” days of Android apps with their crazy permissions is coming to an end. If you have not discovered all the features of 6.0 yet its because you have not looked into what is really there but instead troll the web. 01/26/2016 Emma William Reply Samsung starts rolling out January security update for its flagship smartphones including Galaxy S5 04/03/2016 Elijah Abeyta Reply You’re mistaken. This update is about the marshmallow 6.0.1 and you must be talking about marshmallow 6.0 04/18/2016 William Ernst Reply The update sucks if you have an S5, as it has eliminated the feature that lets you transfer applications to the SD card 05/19/2016 Jamario Souza Reply The worst thing after this update is that I simply lost LTE connection. Only acces 3G. With Android 5 I could manage Network Band and select my prefered band, but now I have no access to it. In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone. It seems to me that Android M has taken a step backwards with my device.

Here’s what I’ve been doing>> USA Jobs Resort 04/14/2016 Robert Reply I disagree. I’ve had my S6 for several months on Lollipop, finally got the update to Marshmallow from Verizon a couple weeks ago and I’m really enjoying it. My S6 has much better battery life and it performs much better in benchmarks and normal use. It’s smoother (not as laggy), apps load faster, messaging is more streamlined (no more waiting to take and send pics through text), and total control of app permissions (finally). Marshmallow is a major update and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s just a shame it took so long to actually get it. 06/21/2016 laurarussell532 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

If it’s not resolved within the two year update I’m moving to iOS. I rather deal with a company that updates regular and is more restrictive about what you can have than a company that takes months and months to update their devices. 01/11/2016 Taha Reply Chuck. Buying a nexus gives you instant apple style hardware and software updates. Cheers 01/12/2016 mnet Reply I agree with you to a point. But you have to ask yourself are you looking for updates for the sake of just getting something “new”? Most updates are minor, granted 6.0 is no minor update.

I think that it’s going to be another couple of months before I see it on my Note 4. But some great additions I didn’t expect…they’ve added scrolling screenshot functionality & the Edge is, at last amazing with half screen functionality and loads upon loads of Edge improvements. Battery life seems far better. I haven’t really dug in to fund everything yet, but so far as great improvement.

Samsung needs to stop making dozens of devices with then dozens of variants of the same device! This is why they can’t update in a timely manner. If Google and Apple can make their device line up simple then so can Samsung! If Apple and Google can bypass carriers for updates and send them direct to users then so can Samsung. Until Samsung smartens up, they have lost me as a customer! Next phone will either be a Google Nexus device or (I hate to say and even think it but) iOS. I left Apple for Android but Google hates sd cards, all other manufacturers are slow to update. It’s ridiculous! Also the fact Samsung is removing the “adoptable storage” feature from their Android 6.0.1 updates is ridiculous! It’s a Google feature and Samsung and LG should have no right to remove/disable it. Give us the choice FFS! F U SAMDUNG! 02/25/2016 Too Squat Reply Note 4 owner…I think this is my last Samsung. I bought it because of the pen. Used to be an HTC buyer, they converted me to Android.

This is like reading the same thing over and over and over again. 4 months into Marshmellow and barely any devices have recieved it. Pathetic. Carriers suck with the added bloatware but it shouldn’t be this damn complicated. The real reason for the wait, S7 and S7 Edge. Gotta make sure as many people buy the latest and greatest before taking care of their actual customers first. Yes, its a business but wow…get the ball rolling Samsung or you’ll be losing about 100 people I know who’d love to try Apple.

Sir….. 02/29/2016 ThisGuyEntitledMuch Reply wow 02/29/2016 Charles Reply To the coders, thanks and all that… I’m sure that you busted a gut over this thing. but, Marshmallow doesn’t appear to be worth the risk of bricking your phone. You got Lollipop working ok.. You even dumped out a security patch. It works… It works well… The phone works as advertised. 6.0 and/or 6.0.1 for all the fanfare and hooplah… just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk. Maybe after 6.0.1 gets debugged… and/or maybe a 6.0.2 rolls out – or, maybe after the security fixes for it hit the bricks… It’ll be mature to a point where it’ll install and do what it’s supposed to do without doing any harm…. That could be a year away. Hell, there is even super hype blurting out over Android N… – and, they haven’t delivered 6.0.1… Why not talk about O and P while you’re at it…. There are still a lot of un-used letters in the alphabet. There is little or no talk about a USA release… thank god. It has to start out in S. Korea… and work its way west thru Bangladesh and Botswana. Sure, fine… brick pygmy phones if you have to. Don’t release the >1Gb bloat code here – until it works… It doesn’t even have to deliver the BS hype… just don’t brick my phone. and, If at all possible – don’t gut any useful functionality – that I had in Lollipop… We all know BS when we hear it. We know it won’t do all that you say it will do…. In short.. Do no harm… Don’t release an OS that is worse than the one we got. 02/29/2016 Bharath Reply Any chance of Touchwiz update on note 4? 03/01/2016 Young_Android_Runner Reply 29Feb2016 > Marshmallow isn’t here yet but we’re already hearing about a potential successor to the Marshmallow update Huh?

Like, now I cannot define the pattern of vibration when a phone rings. Bummer. I liked that. Second, while waking up the phone, the screen-light come on really slowly. Third, the Settings aren’t all same like Galaxy S7. There is no triple-press home button for one-hand use feature. Fourth, Galaxy Labs is absent. Oh well, can’t think of more at the moment. There are many more, though. Disappointing, Samsung.

Google search for your correct way of entering recovery. Then when you do get there, use volume keys as directionals to select clearing system cache. OK that by the power key.

If you don’t have it and don’t care, you still didn’t need to post. Let us rant and why don’t you stay quiet? Samsuck is notorious for sending out upgrades late, thanks to their crappy touchwhiz garbage. They have to make sure the newest OS is working with that and thus it takes the longest. This is my first and last samsuck device, not only because of late OS updates (and N is right around the corner), but also because of their rapid charging mode. It wears out their batteries and people have to go buy new ones after about a year. My iPhone 5 that I gave my wife, I bought at launch and it is still working flawlessly on the same battery. My samsuck nope 4 is not holding the charge it once did because of its battery issue. I won’t be buying a new battery, however, I will be buying a new phone. And if I have to sell a kidney to afford and iPhone then so be it. 03/22/2016 Mathew Bolles Reply I received my update on my US Cellular S6 two days ago.

From what I can tell…. No one involved in the process seems to know what the process is. Supposedly, it is really rolling out some where… Botswana… Bangladesh… the Punjab in India. It is rolling of obscure tele-cos… with 10s of 100s of customers… The smaller the better. No projected or predicted or implied delivery dates have been met – any where. Those that got it – and, it worked – don’t seem to have a problem with it… even if it comes with its own completely new set of anomalies. Those that got it and it bricked their devices… simply disappear into non-digital existence. There seems to be some people that may or may not have it… that just love it to death. They are others seeing it as a cure for imagined ills. Then their are a few walking wounded that actually did get it… And, it didn’t deliver as promised. Bottom Line…. So far, it’s a huge non-event… and, that may be the good news… Some devices are skipping this promised land – for the next new – not quite there – version N. Which one must assume will be as nebulous as the nearly existent Marshmallow. This would all be a horrible fate if there was a problem with Lollipop to begin with. Fortunately, Lollipop isn’t all that bad. These promised improvements are like chasing mirages in the dessert… That can be a real problem if you are dying of thirst. The problem for the Android Overlords is that they can’t get any one thirsty for the new products…. Rumors, innuendos, and power of suggestion will only get you – but, so far. Plus, if you deliver one of these half-baked products – and, it bricks millions of devices… that a hell-of-a-lot of negative advertisement to get over. So, the latest update on the update… is that it is still kind of there but not there. No carrier has a completed roll out for all their devices. No device manufacturer has a completed roll out for all their makes and models on all carriers. There isn’t even a single device that is up and running on all carriers. It’s just one very specific make, model, – possibly even a specific block of serial numbers – within a model… pops up with a roll out on – one very specific carrier – usually some where outside the US. This is touted as progress…. Where – in comparison – Apple pulls a roll out and gets 80% of their products updated in a month… Still, ya have to admit…. Marshmallow is worth every penny ya paid for it. 03/24/2016 Jeffrey Gohlke Reply US Cellular S6 updated to 6.0.1 today 3-24-16 03/24/2016 Thersathomas Reply 203=1m­­­­­­­­­y neigh­­­­­­­­­bor’s mo­­­­­­­­­m m­­­­­­­­­akes $80 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e int­­­­­­­­­ernet .

However the update to 6.0.1 on the note 4 has a few issues so far, after the upgrade all my Bluetooth connections were wiped out and reconnecting is an issue because I have to reboot the phone and restart the headset 1 or 2 times before the phone sees the headset, I also found that one of tge greatest additions in marshmallows has been left out of the update and that is the theme engine, I mean really what sense does it make to leave out one of the best features, please put out an update that adds this feature back.

Sure, no one wants to rush anything… Why risk bricking your phone? The customers didn’t demand this. The customers aren’t really feeling the burn here… Yet, the vaguest reference of a siting in the most obscure of countries and the smallest of carriers – gets absurd pronouncements. It’ll happen when it happens. About the only good thing you can say about it – is – that it’s worth every penny you paid for it. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Here’s my 2¢. I’m glad my Note 4 got it as it is an update, it looks OK and works. I don’t like that Sammy took away the ability to move apps to the SD card and that I’ve gotta put the password in every time I reboot the phone. Other methods like fingerprint scan won’t work till after it’s fully rebooted via entering the password. I don’t think I’ve got extra emoji or wherever the modified battery saver was. It did come with a generous supply of Sprint/TouchWiz bloat as usual, but maybe a bit lighter by a few percentage points. I’m glad I didn’t pay for it though. And the next device for me will be called Nexus. See what you get for 2¢. :-P 03/30/2016 Wilson Reply After running the new update my S6 now randomly re-starts itself and I would say roughly half the phone calls are going directly to voicemail.

The pundits sell great snake oil…. btw… And, what’s wrong with snake oil – you might say. When was the last time you saw a squeaky snake? oh… well… There is always April – then May – then June…. Maybe some country some where with a sizable telecom – will roll this thing out and get it to work. Buyer be ware… If you got it “on” your new device – don’t panic… it’ll probably work just fine. Upgrading older devices – is always a bit of a crap shoot. If you bought older legacy hardware and update prior to loading your old apps…. that might work ok, too.. Marshmallow isn’t all that evil… It just can’t cope with all the possible combinations of footprints left over from old OS’s and legacy apps. Nothing ever has. Nothing ever will. The glacial roll out is probably a blessing – in that it is sparing you from the infinite new anomalies that you will encounter… The purported enhancements/improvements – may – or, may not – work as advertised. but, At least, you have gotten used to the quirks in your current device. Why suffer the trials and tribulations of different quirks – whilst Beta testing the lasted flavor. I guess that I long for the daze when one could stone false prophets. Back in the good ole daze, if the prophet spoke and got it wrong – they took him out to the gates of the city and stoned him… Not much of a retirement plan… But, it really cut down on people making idiot claims and speculations. 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Verizon has already inflicted/infected the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 users with Marshmallow…. Batteries dying… WiFi croaking… no access to the AppStore… BlueTooth disconnecting…. Who will be the next victim? Will they bless the 6s class? What did they ever do the Verizon… other than subscribe. The good news here – is – that as glacial as Android is with the updates, they aren’t all that essential. The updates sell features that you have never had… you are being told that you want them. Also… it’s great that it’s free… The update is worth every penny that you paid for it. So – not getting something that you don’t need and didn’t ask for – for money that you never paid… isn’t all that bad of a deal… Then Verizon steps in with its non-value added contribution. This slows the process even further. By the time Verizon is finished bloating the code, even more lettered releases appear on the horizon… N, O, P, etc. Which may displace the much exalted M – all together… and, Is that bad? You are still not paying for it. You still didn’t ask for it. You still don’t need it. So, does it ever matter, which version of the next shiny new OS that you aren’t actually getting? The hype seems totally unaffected. These are the same guys that barely got KitKat and Lolipop to stop coughing up blood… and, those two combined only pulled 37% of the market share for Samsung. Marshmallow is languishing at 2.3% – after 4 months. This is almost as much fun to watch as MicroSloth WinWoes rolling out their free WinWoes Tin…. 03/31/2016 Amy Sweet Reply Did the Marshmallow update and I can no longer lock my phone.

Now my autocorrect replaces REAL words that I have spelled CORRECTLY with words it THINKS I meant and makes me look stupid. Someone can text and ask how I am. I reply “I’m good!” And it corrects the word good and changes it to “not” so I wind up sending “I’m not!” It’s beyond agitating!!! And if I turn it off completely, then I’m left with it correcting nothing at all. So now I’ll have to download a less idiotic keyboard to use and eastern space on my note 5 to do so. this is BS.

My update was just short of 1.4 GB. It has improved my Note by making it feel smoother and more intuitive. It seems to also be a bit lighter as in not so bloated, but I’m unable to confirm that as a fact. The only area I’m disappointed, and it’s a great disservice to us owners in my opinion, I no longer can move apps to the SD card. It’s not even accessable, as in moving apps to it, unless I’m missing something. This in my opinion is a real failure by Sammy. It just confirms my previous plan to go Nexus next time around. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Sorry for my redundancy at the end there. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply OK so there actually IS a way to transfer files from phone memory to a mounted SD card.

Standby… 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply This may help some or all who have received Marshmallow and are having issues with the apps not acting right, the Wi-Fi or etc. This is worth trying once. Learn where you do this on your particular phone as I don’t know about all is of them. I do know I did this to my Sammy Note 4 on Sprint and it helped with crashing apps after updating. Clear all cache. Then reboot. See if it helps. Hint: some devices have a setting menu for this, others you shut off the phone then get to the restore screen to clear cache. Afterwards in either, do a reboot if possible. 04/09/2016 Landon R Caviness Reply Come on AT&T… By far the slowest carrier for updates… 04/10/2016 Ehsan Reply I am overall pleased with the marshmallow update in note 5 features are great interface just goto better, the only thing annoying to me is the grey strip on the top notification panel where battery indicator time etc are located.

Size: 1474.19 MB Version: N915PVPU4DPD1/N915PSPT4DPD1/N915PVPU4DPD1 · OS upgrade – Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow · To get the best from your device, please keep your phone up to date and regularly check for software updates. ※ Fingerprints are securely protected. An alternative unlock method (pattern, PIN, or password) is required to add fingerprints. ※ Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow does not support the Decrypt device function.

Go to Galaxy Apps or Play Store to update apps. 04/21/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow… 6.0.1 – over hyped… bloated… non-plused…. overall = not bad. For a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+ / with Verizon, it’s not all that bad. My phone did not brick. My phone is not coughing up blood. The battery does not die… though – I’m not quite sure that the super enhanced improvement is there… The battery is doing ok.. not noticeably worse. The graphic depiction of projected duration is longer… I haven’t tried running it out to 12 hours yet… I don’t run enough BlueTooth peripherals to show a problem… It says its still there… I’m taking it at its word. The WiFi… may have had a problem – or, not…. The home WiFi didn’t skip a beat. The historical archive of pre-existing connections did ok, too… Scanning for potential – new – WiFis could be a problem – or, not… it could just work differently. I’ve had to re-register on a couple of hubs… So far, no big deal. The phone does not get mysteriously hot… or, cold… It does not randomly buzz, vibrate, reboot – or, speak in tongues. All the apps seem to have made it. The app store(s) are still there… — there is a special permission for non-PlayStore apps… Click a button and the Amazon apps, etc… are good to go. The GPS is doing ok. It appears to be doing every bit as well as the old Lollipop… It may be a schoosh faster – snappier. Schoosh…is a technical digital device term = barely noticeable. The user interface “is” slightly different… enough to annoy… I can’t see much of a wow factor in it. The “edge” feature is different… (? better ?)… It’s only better if you were a heavy user to begin with. If you had never bonded to the feature to begin with.. this probably isn’t going to get you anymore involved. So far, Marshmallow is a benevolent improvement. It has done no noticeable harm. I haven’t lost any capabilities. It may even be an improvement – overall. I can’t dodge the feeling that I am missing something… with all the fanfare, there should be some sort of wow-factor that justifies all the hype… Sometimes ya just have to take it as it is… at least, it didn’t set me back. I would recommend it – if I only knew – why? 04/21/2016 Elle Reply Thank you 04/22/2016 Lisa Miceli Reply UGH…not a fan of the update at all.

Like the notifications are gone, developer options says “it doesn’t work for this user”, multitasking app doesn’t work, home and back button is the only one the works. Please help. 05/02/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow 6.0.1 doesn’t seem to be all that bad…. Eventually, it automatically downloaded, then the annoying window was there for about a week every time you unlocked the screen. I finally consented for it to install… (Verizon Samsung Galaxy s6 edge plus) It blinked and buzzed… blinked some more.. went dark… for awhile… lit back up… did some more blinking… buzzed…. – after a bit, it looked like it was gunna actually do sumthun… The start screen lit up and it jingled its jangle… Then there was much flashing and an occasional buzz…. Once it finished convulsing, I went for a shut down, which it did. After a few moments of calm, I started it back up again. This time it started with less fan fare… about as quickly as Lollipop… It still wanted to do some tweaking… So, for the first half hour or so – it was clunky. Whatever the upgrade is – it takes time to digest. Over the following week or so… mileage has varied. Nothing bad… = but, no wow factor either. The battery usage is some where between psychotic and bewildering. Sometimes it predicts 8 hours… sometimes 3 days. There are weird slopes in the discharge curve, which effect the battery life prognostications. It may depend on signal strength, whether or not WiFi is enabled… and/or the strength of the WiFi signal.. It may also be effected by back ground app updates and the relative signal strengths during those processes.. and, There may be god knows what going on with apps optimizations. I have not let this thing go for 3 days and attained the promised duration… Before I could get 8hr, 12hrs… maybe 16 hrs… before an auto shut down. The best to date with marshmallow – I’ve gotten down to around 30 – 40% in power savings mode in about 22 hrs…. which is an improvement. I just don’t know if I can believe it. The digital services seem to be a bit snappier, quicker. No big difference with calls, gps, bluetooth, or WiFi… The searching and notifications of “new” WiFi signals may be different – but, the devices seems to connect to the old connections – ok. Basically, It hasn’t screwed much of anything up…. I have a very undemanding regimen for the device. What I had it doing – it still does, which is all I asked for. The new “can’t live without features” – eh… just not all that into them, yet. They aren’t bad… I bought the edge plus for the bigger screen – not so much for the edge technology. There’s nothing wrong with it… just wasn’t a big deal to begin with. With all the tapping, dragging, swiping, pinching, spreading… another way of doing the same stuff just adds another layer of confusion to the process… Still, the edge stuff works… The edge bar is bigger.. If I used it, it would be helpful. I can definitely say, that it was worth every penny I paid for it. It has done no damage. No data lost. No performance lost. No functionality lost. The learning curve for the new features is negligible. This positions the device to take advantage of new features in my existing apps. So far – so good…. It may be a benefit for battery usage and charging It will probably be better on my Samsung Galaxy Tab s2… 05/02/2016 Dustin Hall Reply My S6 updated to Marshmallow this morning and I’m getting all these errors: messaging app totally not working, laggy overload for every app, not recognizing my thumbprint, battery draining exceptionally fast.

They are providing no details to their users and it is causing an uproar on their forums with no official notice.

I bought the Galxaxy S6 just to I could use VR Gear .Other than VR, I don’t see any practical iuse for it. Even the most basic things (like finding the IMEI were difficult) and it doesn’t seem to flow s fluid as iPnone does. No iCloud, no iTunes, no FaceTime, no seamless integration with Mac. I will say this: I love being able to add extra stprage to the Android, and though Google Maps and YouTube works great on the Android, gut not on the iPhone. It’s almost as if they crippled the Google apps on iPhone to make it seem lie iPhones sucks.

Try powering off the phone, then boot to recovery mode (hold the home button, the volume up button, and power at the same time) when recovery mode appears, select “wipe cache partition” then reboot. Hope that helps, if not, go back to recovery and do a factory reset. 05/08/2016 Andy Tan Reply just want to know that when can get the update for malaysia ? and in malaysia , S5 will get 6.0 or 6.0.1.. thx 06/03/2016 Ed Reply You’re better off without the update.

I like to keep my phone on silent 24/7 so I don’t bother others, so before I updated it, it had a solid long vibrate and was able to feel it to let me know I got a message but now it’s just 2 really fast buzzes that I can barely feel….it tells me I can set the vibration to the pattern I want but it’s still the 2 quick buzzes….can anyone help me or has anyone had the same problem happen to them??? 05/10/2016 Zachary Munden Reply I wanted to tell everyone that U.S. Cellular has sent out the 6.0 update! 05/11/2016 Brian Reply I wanted to pass this along to owners of the Galaxy Note 4 SM-N910AZKEATT. I am an AT&T customer and like many of you I have been awaiting the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update, but I have been waiting for it for very different reasons. Some owners of the phone may be waiting for it for the same reasons as well. Here is the problem:   Since the internet released that AT&T rolled out the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update overseas, Google App vendors have been upgrading their softwares for the Note in anticipation of the Marshmallow Platform Update. If you are like me and you have been paying attention, these Google Play Apps update sometime 1 to 5 times weekly. With the updates being installed, the phone begins to freeze in certain applications. The phone may allow you close out the application so you may relaunch it, but in my instance this also means removing the battery cover (waiting for a time) and restarting the device. The reason I have now been told 5 times by AT&T tech reps is that the phone has not been updated with the software needed to support the updated Apps. So basically, between 1 to 6 times daily my device freezes.   Now, when I became upset about this was when I was told to upgrade to a new device, instead of being told when the Marshmallow Update would be released. Basically, my device is acting like it has a virus but is actually working as intended but is having a problem with software in Apps versus Platform issue. This meant I was being told upgrade a perfectly good working phone when there was nothing actually wrong with it. I got to thinking about how many AT&T customers are being told this, who may not be asking the right questions and I became even angrier, as they are throwing money at the company for a problem that is easily fixed:   1.       Either they indicate the Galaxy Note 4 is not going to be upgraded in the US, which causes vendors to stop notifying your phone to upgrade Apps. 2.       Or, they upgrade the phone to Marshmallow Software in the US post haste.   Basically I am outlining a very poor customer service issue. This is either due to AT&T’s negligence, Samsung’s negligence, or Googles. When you call to speak with anyone about this, they point the finger elsewhere as the problem. Warranty sent me a refurbished device to see if it will work better for me. It is on its way. I doubt it will, because of the issues I have been having. I thought I would pass this along to encourage all with a Galaxy Note 4 to call AT&T if you have been told to upgrade your device unnecessarily.   I upgrade, normally to a new phone 1x a year. As a present to myself on my birthday. This is the first time I did not upgrade as I was not happy with the lack of expandable memory in the Note 5. So I kept the phone. So now almost 2 years later, I am having all of these problems with a perfectly good phone and due to lack of SOFTWARE SUPPORT.  I hope me explaining this issues helps address your problem if you are having the same issue yourself. I encourage you to complain. Perhaps this will induce them to release the software, or finally release that they have no intention of doing so. Which also fixes the problem. 05/16/2016 Eric Johnson Reply Very nicely said. You brought out all the problems I was having. After I read your very long message, I was really with on most points. My final thought was I’m going to have to complain and complain. So like you said, complain about these issues were having. Maybe, just maybe that will work. Let’s hope that works. 05/11/2016 Shanna Hall Reply My Galaxy S6 Says That It Is Up to date But My Phone Is Still On lollipop. I haven’t even gotten the option to get marshmallow yet. I have at&t by the way. 05/13/2016 George Reply Why does this site keep showing it’s been updated with new information and staying at the top of the search engine list. Is it because of people leaving comments? It’s pretty dumb if that’s the case. There is nothing new here to read about, it’s the same info over and over again as well as people saying they got the update or complaining that android sucks and the marshmallow update ruined their phone 05/16/2016 Mike Reply Look at the date of the post. I searched it today (the 16th of May) and it says it was updated…today. I bet if I come back tomorrow and refresh it will say it was updated on the 17th.

Google customers are already running Android 7.0 while the rest of use wait for 6.0.1 which really offers no great new features unlike N which has inline replies split screen for multi tasking, night and day modes and hundreds of new features Samsung won’t ever get. Most Samsung’s still run lollipop, while I run the new modern OS Android 7 which came via an OTA as soon as I got my lg nexus which runs pure Android not some dodgy rip off touch wiz crap. Samsung’s owners are some of the last to ever get updates even smaller brands already have marshmallow out of the box. I also get updates before any other brand for the life of the phone not for a limited time like none Google branded phones. I like to get my updates fast not years after its release. 05/17/2016 Brodie Yg Reply And I can’t believe how people think it’s hard to find an imei number in Android it’s a 5 digut dialler code *#06# it’s that simple unlike Apple were you have to go through multiple screen to get such information. 05/17/2016 TBen Reply Te reason why most people buy Samsung phones and not Nexus is because Nexus is just a piece of crap.

The battery blather… – all the hype about improved battery performance – is a bit weird. The prognostications as to when it will die are all over the place. Sometimes it thinks that it can run for daze on the existing charge… sometimes just 6 to 8 hours… It “does” seem to re-charge faster. It doesn’t seem to be overheated when it does so. So far, it has been benevolently benign…. No lost data… No lock ups. It still works about like it did with Lolipop… I have noticed an occasional re-boot, on its own.. No boot loops. Some apps are a bit snappier and faster… some aren’t… some are the same. It could just be the calm before the storm… The chargers, the cables, the device hardware and OS have come into temporary alignment. We all know that it won’t last…. Sooner or later 5G will drop… = new hardware, new chargers and new cables… the OS will be gawd knows what by then.

Mashmallow,go get toasted. You have caused my phone to overheat, slow its connection to almost anything, freeze so I can’t see my unlock pattern with the keyboard constantly coming up on my Homecreen. Finally the best bit, I always clean out old apps and crap to stop security issues and the CPU slowing down, and I no tech geek. So I should get more than five hours out of a battery charge, when all I doing is leaving it switched on? Samsung – Happy for you to send me a new phone. Otherwise I have no choice but to revive my old Galaxy 4. Kinda sux after paying it off over 12 months. 08/12/2016 Shereen Reply I did my update on Galaxy A5 and love the look. I just have a few concerns, I have checked all my settings and I don’t have restricted data active and my whatsapp come through only when I am in wifi or when I go into whatsapp. This wasn’t like this before I did the update. Not sure what went wrong. I also noticed that when I go into my gallery it hangs before showing me the folders so I can view my photos. 08/13/2016 Mrticklesz Reply Its because they’re trying to sell their new products which is no any different than the note 4.. damn you samsung! 08/14/2016 Dee Reply Still no marshmallow for Galaxy Alpha… 08/18/2016 Dwan Sadler Reply Why didn’t the Sprin’ts Marshmallow update come with video calling? ATT, Verizon, and T-Mobile all have Samsung video calling S M H 08/23/2016 fux Reply Galaxy Alpha – waiting is the hardest time! 08/23/2016 Charles Reply ??? Lollipop worked ??? Marshmallow worked. The security patch worked… Worked = didn’t brick the phone. Differences in performance = negligible. Additional features almost unnoticeable. Improvements = possibly… then again – maybe not. At least, this stuff does no harm… and, It’s worth every penny ya paid for it…. Will the next security fix – really – fix anything… It won’t matter. The guys out there hacking code are so far ahead of the security patches – that they aren’t loosing sleep over the security patches. The security patches only patch found leaks anyway. Will Nougat fix the security issues… = probably not… but, it will make life difficult enough on the device owners to make them think that security has improved.. The hackers are way ahead of the process. They’ll have Nougat leaking while it’s still in beta. So.. we will get yet another candy flavor – this year… That will fulfill our un-expressed desires… They’ll add stuff that we didn’t ask for, telling us that we can’t live without it. They’ll sell it as a security necessity, whilst working on all the dozens of known security compromises. And, roll out a bug fix / security patch weeks after they drop the barely out of beta Nougat. All this does not matter to me. I’m in this for the damn phone. So long as I can make calls / receive calls – I’am ok with all the update/patch bull$hit… Just don’t brick the phone. 08/25/2016 sadsds Reply who can tell me when malaysia will get marshmallow update for galaxy a8(-a800f)? 08/26/2016 Ray Reply I just got the Marshmallow update for my AT&T S5 today.

I also just received the update for the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 tablet. I’m glad they supported this tablet but they clearly did as minimal work as possible. There’s almost no visible change whatsoever. No change in notifications or app drawer at all. Some very slight changes in the Settings menu and that’s about it. I am eager to try bonding the SD card with the main storage memory though as the 16 GB tablets have never cut it. 09/12/2016 MarshmallowForcedFacortyReset Reply I was woken up this morning around 1:30 to my phone making the tmobile sound. I get up and it said the update failed, I selected to have it try again and it forced a factory reset on my phone. All my contacts and out of my 200+ contacts I have 11 now. None of my bookmarks for internet browsers are there. I can’t seriously be the only one. I have a Samsung J7, model number SM-7J00T, and I’m in Washington State. Even things some of the things I had saved on my SD card got wiped. So you can imagine I’m beyond many colorful expressions, especially with the line of work I’m in and the fact I’m also in school right now.

Home Industry Technology Google might stop Gmail service on your computer: here’s why Google might stop Gmail service on your computer: here’s why Tech giant Google has announced that its Gmail service will stop working on some Chrome browsers by the end of 2017. By: FE Online | Published: February 3, 2017 1:15 PM According to a blog posted by Google, it has informed that Gmail will stop working on 53 or lower version of its Chrome browser. The process of stopping Gmail for working on these versions will start from February 8 itself. Tech giant Google has announced that its Gmail service will stop working on some Chrome browsers by the end of 2017. According to a blog posted by Google, it has informed that Gmail will stop working on 53 or lower version of its Chrome browser. The process of stopping Gmail for working on these versions will start from February 8 itself. This move by Google, essentially means that it’s time for Windows XP and Windows Vista users, to start worrying, as they will not be able to use the emailing feature of Google on their Chrome browser. According to Google, the Chrome browser’s versions lower than 53 are open to security risks, mainly because Microsft had stopped the OS support for Windows XP and Vista. This means that if you are still using Chrome v53 or lower, be ready to likely get affected by attacks. Moreover, there will be no bug fixes or security patches available to you. According to Google, you will be able to continue using the Chrome browser till the end of the year, but it will be in the basic HTML version only. Google wrote on the blog, “Gmail users that are still on Windows XP and Windows Vista are the most likely to be affected because v49 was the last released version which supported those operating systems.” Also read | Beware! A new Gmail scam has tricked even computer experts; here’s how you can avoid losing your password Google said that Gmail users who are still on Chrome browser v53 or below will be flashed a message or banner on their screens. In the blog post, Google said, “Google does not typically announce when we discontinue support for older versions of Chrome browser because of our current supported browser policy, which states that only the most recent versions of Chrome are supported. This announcement was made given the expected impact on Windows XP and Windows Vista users and known security risks.” Also read | Now sign into Gmail via Yahoo: Top 5 key features It is important that users should migrate to more secure and supported systems, Google says. If you are still using the Windows XP or Vista OS, you should now upgrade to a new OS. You may also use other browsers to open your Gmail account but it would still leave it highly vulnerable to attacks. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Google makes its security patch available to the OEMs every month with bug fixes and security improvements to the Android build but this time around Sony has definitely surprised the industry with its speed of rolling out the update. The Japanese consumer electronics giant has started rolling out the firmware update, with build number 39.2.A.0.417, for the Xperia XZ and X Performance, which includes Google's February Android security update, Xperia Blog said in its report. Additionally, Xperia X and X Compact have received the February patch as well with their latest update (build 34.2.A.0.311). LG Puts Up January Security Bulletin Before Google Usually it's the Nexus or Pixel smartphones that get the update first due the backing provided by Google but this time around, Sony has made a strong statement by rolling out its update this early in the month. Considering that there have been several vulnerabilities associated with Android that have been exposed by security firms and researchers in last few months, this can be seen as a welcome change from the company. Notably, the search giant earlier fixed the "Dirty COW" vulnerability with its December Android security update. Google has previously encouraged OEMs to push out the security updates in a timely manner in order to keep the devices secure and updated.

Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. Also Read: Snapchat files for one of the biggest tech IPOs in years: Report The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 per cent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc.Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. Tight control Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Also Read: Snapchat parent selects New York Stock Exchange for IPO Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. Paying Google Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage.

Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform.

Snap’s publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap’s daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 per cent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6m in 2016 from $372.9m the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. “What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money,” said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first US company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20b to $25b, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a US technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google. “The industry has been crying out for new advertising units” says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. Tight control Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503, 205 in salary, with a $1m bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat’s chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2m bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3m worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap’s stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn’t predict if the structure would “result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations” in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can “vote with their feet” by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. “Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?” said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. Paying Google Snap had $404.5m in sales in 2016, up from $58.7m in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459m, compared with $292.9m in 2015. Snap’s biggest losses stem from “hosting fees” which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2b over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company’s costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. “They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses,” said SharesPost’s Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | January 31, 2017 -- 20:32 GMT (12:32 PST) | Topic: Developer Google said it will move its Chrome for iOS code into the open source community and may have gotten a few digs into Apple while it was at it. special feature Securing Your Mobile Enterprise Mobile devices continue their march toward becoming powerful productivity machines. But they are also major security risks if they aren't managed properly. We look at the latest wisdom and best practices for securing the mobile workforce. Read More In a blog post, Google noted that Chrome iOS "was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform." Now Google is moving it into the Chromium project's open source repository. Google noted that to move the code it needed to do "careful refactoring." Specifically, Google said Chrome on iOS had to support WebKit's rendering engine as well as Blink, a engine supported by Chrome for other platforms. TechRepublic: Apple iPhone 7 is being hardened to handle military-grade secrets Google said development speed will be faster for tests of Chrome on iOS. Reading the blog post, I couldn't help but notice that Google mentioned complexity and constraints when referring to Apple iOS. The subtle phrasing obviously is rooted in Google's contention that its Android platform is better for developers. In any case, Google had two variations of the word complex and one mention of constraints in the first 97 words of a blog post.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Friday, February 3, 2017, 8:00 [IST] Mobile malware is on the rise and your device could be at risk. These tips could help you stay safe and keep your personal information out of the hands of cybercriminals. Well, if you currently analyze the smartphone market then you can see that the adoption rate of mobile devices has skyrocketed and evidently Android is leading the way. The open-source operating system that has been developed by Google is now found on more than half of all smartphones. In fact, according to a report from Strategy Analytics, about nine in 10 smartphones shipped in the latest quarter ran Google's mobile operating system. In addition, Android accounted for a record 87.5% of the 375 million smartphones shipped in the third quarter, ending September 30, 2016. So you can clearly see from the stats that Android continues to dominate the smartphone market. However, because of its popularity and a massive user base, it has now caught the attention of cybercriminals. Currently, Android mobiles are being targeted by virus and malware developers. Moreover, these malware developers are targeting Android mobile devices to accomplish their goals or illegally obtain personal information from Android owners. SEE ALSO: Android 7.1.2 adds swipe for notifications gesture to Nexus 5X and 6P While this is the present scenario in the Android world, with the advancement of mobile technology, mobile malware and viruses are becoming more advanced and thus are infecting millions of mobile worldwide. On the other hand, it is highly recommended that you stick to apps from the official Google Play Store only. If you do you are unlikely to encounter any of the dangerous malware out there. Just to let you know, malware lives and thrives in unofficial app stores, which are largely unregulated. Having said all that, here are the worst malware types you should be aware of and also keep your mobile away. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Ransomware Ransomware is basically a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom to be paid off to re-gain access back to your files. An example of ransomware would be an app called Simplocker. Simplocker is basically a Trojan malware that disguises itself as an app suitable for adults only. If Simplocker is downloaded and as it enters your smartphone it scans your smartphone's SD card for documents, images and videos. After the scan is complete it encrypts those files using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Then it displays a fake FBI message in Russian that accuses the victim of downloading and viewing child pornography on their device. And to get the files back, Simplocker demands some amount to be paid within 24 hrs. It claims that failing to pay the ransom will result in removing all of the files that it has encrypted. However, it has been said that the app doesn't have the functionality to do so. If you are infected with Simplocker, you can download Simplocker Decryptor that was created by ESET. Another type of ransomware which has gained lot notoriety is the "svpeng", which combines ransomware with credit card theft. Svpeng works by presenting a screen to input credit card details every time a user accesses Google Play Store, which then sends the credit card details to the criminal behind this malware. Moreover, once spveng is on your smartphone, it would check to see whether you have a banking app installed. The good news is the Russian police arrested the creator of spveng in April after he stole more than 50 million rubles ($930, 000) and infected more than 350, 000 Android devices. Mobile Shutting Down Android/PowerOffHijack discovered by AVG, is a type of malware that takes control of the process responsible for shutting down your smartphone. With this malware, your phone appears to be off when in fact it's on and functioning. Interestingly, the malware even plays the shutdown animation to show that your device is really turning off. And what this power off hijack really does is it secretly takes pictures, makes calls, and sends messages while you think that your phone is turned off. On the bright side, this type of malware only affects Android versions under 5.0, requires root access and has been found only on apps outside of Google Play Store.

According to experts, "HummingBad" has already attacked more than 10 million Android devices worldwide. Dangerously, this malware has the power to take control of devices; it forces users to click advertisements and download apps by using a multistage attack chain. Moreover, the malware tries to gain access to your device through certain websites and infect it. Once it gets through the device it then tries to gain root access to the device by running software. If it succeeds to get the root access, the attackers will gain full access to your mobile. In case if the malware fails to gain root access, it uses a fake system through which it sends an update notification to your mobile to get system-level permission. Viking Horde This virus can be pretty devastating and harmful for your device. Why we say that is because "Viking Horde" has been created for Google Play Store apps. Through these apps, the virus creates a place in Android devices. Moreover, the virus can infect both rooted and non-rooted devices. So, whenever a user downloads an infected app from Google Play Store, the device gets infected by the malware. The risks of rooted devices are bigger compared to non-rooted devices. In rooted devices, "Viking Horde" installs software and executes code remotely to get access to the mobile data. If it does, then the data of your mobile is at risk. The reason behind launching this app is for conducting ad clicks, spam messages, and others. SEE ALSO: Google Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will not get Android Nougat 7.1.2 update Phishing Apps While mobile browsing of the internet is growing with smartphone and tablet penetration, fraudsters and cyber criminals are now creating mobile phishing sites that look similar to a legitimate service. And with the existence of such sites these attackers are stealing users' credentials or worse. The fact that mobile devices come with smaller screen is making malicious phishing techniques easier to hide from users. As such it is less sophisticated on mobile devices than PCs. Moreover, phishing schemes use rogue mobile apps, programs which can be considered "trojanized", while hiding their true intent as a system update, marketing offer or game. Some of these malware infect legitimate apps also with malicious code which can be only discovered after installing. Malware Symptoms Having looked at the different types of mobile malware, you might have an idea on how they spread and infect devices. While the do come in various ways, they all can produce similar symptoms. Well, signs of a malware infection can include unwanted behaviors and degradation of device performance. Stability issues such as frozen apps, failure to reboot and difficulty connecting to the network are also common. In addition, mobile malware can drain your battery or processing power, hijack the browser, send unauthorized SMS messages, freeze or spoil the device entirely. SEE ALSO: Google rolls out Android Nougat 7.1.2 Developer Preview for Pixel and Nexus phones How to be Safe? So if you are wondering how you can avoid and be safe from such malware then there are several best practices that all mobile users should follow to prevent Android malware infections. In essence, some malware cases may require special prevention and treatment methods, but following these recommendations will greatly increase a user's protection from a wide range of mobile malware. #1 Download apps only from official app stores like Apple's App Store or Google Play. The vast majority of malicious apps are found on unofficial app stores or websites, many based in China or Russia. #2 Do some research on the developer and their reputation. Read user ratings, paying special attention to reviews from disgruntled users, and seek out app recommendations from reputable sources. #3 Think twice before granting "permissions" when installing new apps for the first time. Often, malicious app developers are counting on that level of carelessness to sneak malware onto your device. Always make sure to carefully read the end user agreement before clicking to understand exactly what permissions the app is asking for. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Nexus 5X gets fingerprint swipe, Nexus 6P might follow JC Torres - Feb 3, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Android platform is already notorious for its fragmentation and Google may have contributed to that even further. When it launched its own Google Pixel, it introduced some features that may never reach its other Nexus devices, even if the hardware were capable of supporting it. Google’s tune has changed a bit after much criticism, at least for one particular feature. Fingerprint swipe down, first seen on the Pixel, are coming and, at least according to some reports, has already landed on some Nexus 5X devices. Google has been using a hardware excuse for some of the Pixel features it has decided not to provide other Nexus devices. That, however, has largely been debunked and even Google would later admit that the Nexus 5X, and even the Nexus 6P, have capable fingerprint scanners. It was all a matter of updating firmware and software. Google did say it was doable and would investigate the matter. Apparently, they were able to actually make it happen. That’s happening now with the roll out of the Android 7.1.2 maintenance update to the Nexus 5X. A new “Moves” option appears after installing the update, allowing users to roll down the notification panel by simply swiping down on the fingerprint scanner on the back. What hasn’t happened yet, however, is the same update for the Nexus 6P. It would definitely be painful irony if the more powerful Nexus is left out of this feature, which will surely rouse even more vocal complaints. Chances are, the Nexus 6P will follow suit soon. Hopefully. While it’s indeed good that Google has decided to bring the feature down to the Nexus, its implementation is actually quite limited compared to third-party alternatives. Especially when you have a rooted Nexus phone. Now if only Google would do the same for Night Mode.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Android Android 7.1.2 Nougat Update: Here Are The Phones Getting First Roll Out By Michael Jay Toledo on February 3 2017 03:53 PM Share Tweet Share Share Email On Monday, Google announced that Android Nougat 7.1.2 is already rolling out to their devices. Although it will only be available on their handsets, it will still be great to know what the inclusions of the update are. Here are the things to expect in Nougat 7.1.2. It can be recalled that back in November, consumers were asking why previous Nexus devices did not receive the “Swipe for notifications” gesture. At that time, Google said they were still “evaluating” the feature. But with the recent update, the feature has arrived on Nexus 5X. It is expected to be on Nexus 6P soon as well. The “swipe for notifications” allow users to swipe across the sensor to bring up their app alerts, instead of doing it on the device’s screen. For 5X users, you can see this under “Moves” in Settings. Aside from 5X, the update has also arrived on Pixel XL and Pixel XL Smartphones. As of writing, update 7.1.2 is only available for Google’s handsets. According to Express UK, Android Nougat 7.1.2 also includes redesigned app shortcuts and better image keyboard support. It has a size of 1.25 GB, so it will be more practical if you are connected to a Wi-Fi network before downloading the update. Details about the update’s arrival on other brands, however, are still not available. Hopefully, mainstream brands will disclose the information soon. Android Nougat 7.1.2 On Other Devices Most consumers know that it was Samsung just recently started launching Nougat 7.0 on their handsets. The update only arrived on Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge last month because the company had to test the software first. The main aim of the test was to fix any bug in the system, if there were any. This was also the case for HTC and Sony. Both companies tested Nougat first before rolling it out to their users. It gave them time as well to add some of their own apps, skins, and services in the system. Unfortunately, Samsung, HTC, and Sony seem to be testing 7.1.2 once more before releasing it. Consumers should expect it to be ready in the next few months. These are the latest news and rumors about Android Nougat 7.1.2 so far. Hopefully, it will arrive on other devices soon so no one will be left out. Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

In the smartphone side of things, the Mountain View company's virtual assistant has been exclusive to the Pixel and Pixel XL, but talks about it going beyond the two aren't anything new, as the LG G6 has already been reported to feature it. Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P Major Update To Expand Google Assistant Devices This news comes from Stephen Hall of 9to5Google, and according to him, he was told about this bit included in the next major update. Was recently told that Assistant is finally coming to Nexus 5X/6P soon with next “major” update. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) February 2, 2017 However, that's about it. There aren't that many details surrounding the topic just yet, but that shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering this is a rumor after all. On an interesting note, Google recently introduced the Android 7.1.2 beta to supported Nexus and Pixel devices, putting the factory images up for download too. This is probably not the major update that comes with Assistant, though, not to mention that it's not available for the Nexus 6P just yet, but who knows. More Devices Expected To Get Google Assistant Other Than Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P Aside from the LG G6, the new Nvidia Shield is also set to support Google Assistant sometime in the future. But what about the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9? Well, it's hard to say since they aren't even getting Android 7.1.2, which Google has already confirmed. For those who can't wait to tinker with Google's virtual assistant, there are already guides (via XDA-Developers) on how to have it up and running on Android 7.0 Nougat or higher devices, but it's not exactly for the faint of heart. Some Google Assistant Features To Look Forward To Back in January, the beta version of the Google App contained clues to some notable features that Assistant could offer, which came to light thanks to some users who dug through the codes. First off, it could have keyboard input and gesture support. Second, it could become capable of letting users make payments with voice commands. To boil things down, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P will likely get Google Assistant soon enough, but seeing as this is just a rumor at this point, it's better to take it with the proverbial grain of salt for now. Also, whether or not the major update is referring to Android 7.1.2, 7.1.3, 7.2, or even 8.0 — aka Android O — is unclear. Regardless, this is still a good sign that the AI is about to start making its way to more devices other than the Pixel and Pixel XL. Are you amped-up to have Google Assistant on your phone?

Twitter Facebook Snap is paying Google $400M a year for cloud services Snap has agreed to a minimum annual cloud bill roughly equal to its 2016 revenue Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 03 February, 2017 16:16 - - - - print email Comments Over the next five years, the company behind Snapchat will pay Google at least US$2 billion in cloud bills. On Thursday, Snap revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it signed a five-year contract to pay Google at least $400 million a year for cloud services. That's a steep figure, considering that Snap made roughly $404 million last year.  In return for the massive commitment, Snap will receive reduced pricing, though it’s not clear how deep the company’s discounts will be. Sinking a bunch of money into Google Cloud makes sense, because Snapchat began its life built on top of Google’s AppEngine platform-as-a-service offering. Furthermore, Snap’s commitment to Google is a massive vote of confidence in the latter’s cloud capabilities, at a time when there’s heavy competition in the cloud market. Right now, Google’s cloud is an underdog compared to Microsoft and Amazon. But being tied to a rising star in the social media landscape like Snapchat could help draw other companies to at least give Google’s platform a chance. However, the contract is not without risk. If Snap doesn’t use $400 million worth of Google Cloud services in a year, it’s still on the hook for the full value of the contract. What’s more, the company said in the filing that it uses Google for the “vast majority” of its “computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” If something goes wrong with Google Cloud, or if the tech titan gets out of the public cloud business, it could be bad news for Snap. That last scenario seems highly unlikely, considering that Google continues increasing its investment in its cloud platform. Urs Hölzle, Google’s vice president of technical infrastructure, said last year that the company plans to launch new cloud data centers at the rate of roughly one each month this year. All of this is tied to Snap’s plans to pursue an initial public offering in the near future. The filing released on Thursday is one of the company’s steps along that path. Snap’s IPO is being closely observed by the tech industry because of the company’s high-flying status. It remains to be seen how Wall Street will receive the company, especially since it’s far from profitable and its losses have widened year over year. Plus, the deal with Google means that Snap will be saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in liabilities for the foreseeable future.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile LG Watch Style With Android Wear 2.0 Leaks In Images, Expected To Retail At $249 By Zara Ali Jan 30, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit With Android Wear 2.0 just around the corner, LG is gearing up to bring in two Android Wear smartwatches. In one of his latest leak, Evan Blass took the wraps off LG’s Watch Style that is expected to ship with Google’s Android Wear 2.0. In the leaked pictures, the Watch Style can be seen in three color variants. In the leak, Evan Blass has just posted the pictures of the Watch Style. However, various rumors about the upcoming wearable suggest that it will feature a 1.2-inch P-OLED display with a resolution of 360 x 360 pixel. It will come with 4GB storage and 512MB of RAM. Also, the smartwatch will be dust and water resistant with the IP67 rating. A 240mAh will power the smartwatch. According to a report by Android Police, LG could price the Watch Style around $249. While LG has not confirmed any info regarding the upcoming smartwatch, but the sources suggest that it will have just one variant available in different colour options. LG had been one of the original partners for Google’s Android Wear program and LG’s G Watch was developed under Google’s guidelines. Advertisement Besides, LG is also working on other smartwatches as well. The other one is Watch Sport, which is rumored to come with better specs than the Watch Style. It is expected to feature a 1.38-inch display with a resolution of 480 x 480 pixel, 736MB of RAM, and IP68 rating. The Watch Sport will come with connectivity options such as LTE, NFC, and GPS. With the upgraded specs, the Watch Sport will most likely be priced higher than the Watch Style, around $100 more. The Watch Sport bears similar specifications as LG’s Watch Urbane second edition that was priced at $359.99 (for AT&T) and $449 (for Verizon). So, we could expect the starting price of the Watch Sport around $350 or more. Apple Garners 104% in Smartphone Profits – Other Android Phone Giants Struggling With Losses Regarding the launch of the new range of smartwatches by LG, Evan Blass tips that the company might unveil them ahead of MWC event, on February 9. Going by the design, the Watch Style and Watch Sport do look a little like Google’s upcoming smartwatches. We will get to see both the smartwatches in their glory when LG makes them official. Stay tuned with us for more info.

Thailand Press Release News search General Business Entertainment IT Stcoks Lifestyle Telecom Energy Properties Automotive Heathcare Events ฝากข่าวประชาสัมพันธ์ Its 2017 And This Is Why Its Time for Your Online Tourism Marketing to Get Real General Press Releases Friday February 3, 2017 13:08 Bangkok--3 Feb--ScottAsia Communications Destinations, hotels and tourism businesses should seize the opportunities of digital democracy created by the semantic search revolution that has only just begun, says Bronwyn White, co-founder of MyTravelResearch.com, which is launching a free webinar series for tourism marketers WHEN Google switched its algorithm to semantic search in 2013 it began to clear away dodgy SEO practices and leveled the playing field for small operators and destinations. It made it easier for small businesses to create an honest strategy to rank well online in Google and the search engines. A few years on, the main outcome is that page one of a Google search will be different for every user, every location and every desktop or mobile device. Today, tourism businesses and destinations therefore have the opportunity to rank well for their ideal customer in Google's organic search results – as long as they commit to building online trust, reputation and authority over time. Relevance and trust are the new currencies in town. They have given travel businesses and destinations opportunities that we are unlikely to see again. It's like being at the beginning of time once more, a time when tourism businesses can not only survive online, but thrive. However, there's no quick fix. If you want to be on the first page of your ideal customer's Google search – as MyTravelResearch.com has done for the terms "travel research" in certain regions – you have to be consistent in your online marketing. This means consistency in branding and content marketing. Post relevant, good quality content and post often. To get results you have to be clear about who your customers are and have a well-defined brand that guides your visual choice and gives you a consistent tone of voice and messaging. The Five Steps Clear branding and customer targeting are the baselines. In addition, there are five steps you have to also take: 1) Make sure you're on Google My Business (it's free). 2) Ensure your site is mobile friendly (you can check here for free – and Google gives you tips how to make your site mobile compatible). 3) Realise that content is king. Create content that is useful, relevant and meaningful. Ensure quality over quantity 4) Make sure your web site and your social media platforms are soundly branded in terms of content, language and image choice. 5) Ramp up the number of images and videos you have on your site (Google loves this). For visual content don't think you need to spend big money on video production. You don't. Videos uploaded from smart phones are often deemed more 'authentic'. For example see "Whale of a Time" or "Who are Roo Looking At?" at http://www.news.com.au/travel/australian-holidays/tourism-australias-favourite-social-media-posts-of-2015/news-story/1ec3b7a4183886142db1cf5e5e474e66. Importantly, to achieve a strong online presence in the brave new world of semantic search all the above elements have to work together. Remember, travel related content is the most watched content on YouTube. In western countries people spend about 13 hours doing online research before making a travel purchase (22 hours in China). People everywhere are perplexed and overwhelmed by the abundance of digital marketing choice. If customers are confused by your brand, search engines will be too. So focus your online branding, messaging and be consistent. Turn the above insights into action and put an end to 'hope marketing'. The full Five-Step Tourism Marketing blog can be read at http://www.mytravelresearch.com/5-step-tourism-marketing-system/. * MyTravelResearch.com will launch free webinars where they teach destination marketing organisations and tourism businesses the methodology to successfully implement the five-step tourism marketing system.

Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million (roughly Rs. 3,467 crores) in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first US company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion (roughly Rs. 1,34,754 crores to Rs. 1,68,441 crores), according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a US technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of Internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. Tight control Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. Paying Google Snap had $404.5 million (roughly Rs. 2,725 crores) in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP.

Snap’s publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap’s daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. “What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money,” said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s Google. “The industry has been crying out for new advertising units” says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. Tight Control Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat’s chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap’s stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn’t predict if the structure would “result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations” in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can “vote with their feet” by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. “Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?” said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. Paying Google Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015.  Snap’s biggest losses stem from “hosting fees” which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company’s costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. “They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses,” said SharesPost’s Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook’s Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap’s aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG are leading the offering as underwriters.

And that’s left their Hamptons-style home in Vaucluse all but redundant. But no longer. This week the Parsley Bay property hit the market with a $5.5 million to $5.9 million guide through Michael Pallier, of Sotheby’s International. Held in Temsamani’s name, the 565-square-metre property that backs onto Parsley Bay Reserve last traded in 2010 for $4.75 million after a major renovation by former owners Ord Minnett’s investment advisor Chris Mathews and communication consultant Jane Mathews. Google’s Karim Temsamani is selling his Vaucluse home. Photo: Supplied At the time France-born Temsamani was heading up of Google’s mobile operations, and the couple were trading up from their former Kensington property they sold in 2010 for $2.7 million. Records show the five-bedroom, three-bathroom home has been an executive rental in recent years, earning $3000 a week. What’s in the stars Renowned astrologer Richard Sterling was compulsory reading for many truth seekers of the Australian Women’s Weekly in the 1970s and 1980s, best known for his sometimes vaguely correct annual predictions for the royal family and tips on gardening by the stars. The Katoomba home of the late astrologer Richard Sterling. Photo: Supplied Sterling, who was also an accomplished pianist, was a long-time Blue Mountains resident, where he bought his clifftop home overlooking the Jamison Valley in 1968 for $16,000. Almost 50 years later the two-storey property is for sale by his widow Joy following his death in 2013. The four-bedroom house was built in 1950 and includes panoramic views, multiple living areas and a zodiac garden as featured in Burke’s Backyard in 1992. Tailor Patrick Johnson and his interior designer wife Tamsin are selling their Darling Point apartment.

Fashionistas make a move Patrick Johnson, of bespoke tailor P. Johnson Tailors, and his interior designer wife Tamsin Johnson are trading in their Darling Point apartment for $3.85 million house in Tamarama. Records show the couple’s plan to redesign the beachside home is already underway, having purchased the former family home of Philip Green, until recently the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore. Fashion designer Lizzie Collins and her husband Peter are selling their 1950s-era home in Woollahra. Photo: Supplied It was a similar story on the couple’s Darling Point apartment, which they purchased in 2012 for $1,065,000 and have completely redesigned, no doubt thanks to Tamsin Johnson’s interior design skills. The whole-floor spread in a boutique block of three goes to auction on February 23 for between $1.3 million and $1.4 million through Gavin Rubinstein, of Ray White Double Bay. Meanwhile, iconic ’80s fashion designer Lizzie Collins and her husband Peter are selling their 1950s-era home in Woollahra for some $7 million. Painaustralia chief and founder Lesley Brydon is selling her designer townhouse in Tamarama. Photo: Supplied The five-bedroom home with a private garden and swimming pool is set on more than 1000 square metres and is billed as having a “Palm Springs-style aesthetic” in the marketing by Michael Dunn, of Richardson & Wrench Double Bay. Having purchased the Edgecliff Road home in 1987 for $850,000 from the Bloom family, it is set for auction on February 22. Brydon lists home to downsize It is with a heavy heart that Lesley Brydon, founder and chief executive of the Painaustralia charity, has listed her Tamarama home to downsize to something local by the beach. The Longueville property of the late Rod Macdonald and his widow Robin is for sale for between $3.5 million and $3.8 million. Photo: Supplied Brydon’s four-bedroom, three-bathroom townhouse is one of three in a row designed and built by architect Jake Dowse, which she purchased from supermodel-turn-fashion designer Gail Elliott and her husband Joe Coffey for $2.8 million in 2005. At the time the glamorous fashionistas purchased Dowse’s home next door for $3,175,000, and then sold it three years later for $4.82 million. Depending on where buyer’s agent Dennis Kalofonos finds her downsizer digs, the sale is likely to end Brydon’s 37 years as a Tamarama local, having first bought into the suburb in 1980 on Wonderland Avenue with her then husband, the late TV presenter and journalist Peter Wherrett. Alexander Phillips, of Phillips Pantzer Donnelley, is asking $4.6 million for Brydon’s Fletcher Street home ahead of a February 25 auction. Mosman’s Kirkoswald Avenue residence designed by architect Bill Payne is for sale. Photo: Supplied Another chance for Nirvana The historic Longueville home of the late obstetrician and gynaecologist Rod Macdonald and his widow Robin is for sale ending 44 years of family ownership of one of the suburb’s oldest remaining residences. The Macdonalds are only the third owners of the grand 1898-built property, Nirvana, which was first owned by the family of Alfred Paine Fox for 68 years. It was bought by medico Frank Sharpe in 1958, and sold to the Macdonald family in 1973. The childhood home of ABC Radio presenter Sarah Macdonald has been a long-term restoration project by the family in the decades since, with architect redesigns in 1978 and 1986. Set on a battle-axe block next door to Longueville’s historic Carrum Carrum (which sold to Chinese buyers 2014 for $5.01 million and has remained largely unoccupied ever since, it goes to auction on February 25 for $3.5 million to $3.8 million through Brent Courtney, of McGrath. Going retro in Mosman Lovers of 1960s architecture take note: Mosman’s retro home of modernist commercial architect Bill Payne and his late wife Margaret is up for grabs for the first time since the couple built it in 1965. The Kirkoswald Avenue property was built on a block, since subdivided, on which Payne also designed the house next door before he sold that off in 1993. Payne and Jim Whitehead co-founded Whitehead & Payne architecture firm, designing such landmarks as Roselands Shopping Centre and Top Ryde Shopping Centre. Tim Foote, of Belle Property Mosman, is asking $4.5 million to $5 million for the Kirkoswald Avenue property. Domain Home Price Guide Find out what your property's worth Find out now!

In addition to being able to see photo albums from your Google Photos account, youll be able to scroll to the left to see photos saved internally. The actual Photos on device screen also looks a bit different, more like a traditional gallery, rather than displaying six photos of each folder. Photos: Albums view (2.7)  Device folders (2.7)  Albums view (2.8)  Photos on device (2.8) In the past, If you wanted to see (for instance) a screenshot that you took a couple of weeks ago, you would need to tap the burger menu, and tap Device folders. Its easy for a seasoned smartphone user to poke around and find the menu, but not for those folks who arent particularly inclined to welcome changes in their user interface.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. 13 clever jokes from Google that probably went right over your head Avery Hartmans Jan. 30, 2017, 10:38 AM 337,672 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Google frequently makes us giggle with the geeky ways it handles things. Like the time it rewarded the man who managed to buy the "Google.com" domain for one minute: Google gave researcher Sanmay Ved $6,006.13, choosing that specific amount because it spells out Google, numerically — "squint a little and you'll see it!" the company said. This kind of quirky antic has become almost par for the course for the search giant, which has long been down for a little nerdy fun. "Googleyness" is all about intellectual creativity, after all. Here are some of our other favorite times that Google did or responded to something in a particularly silly way. Jillian D'Onfro contributed to an earlier version of this story. View As: One Page Slides It all started with the IPO. Google used a funny string of numbers in its initial S-1 filing for how much it hoped to raise. Google The first 10 digits of the mathematical constant "e" are 2,718,281,828. Then, a year later, Google collected a bit more than $4 billion by selling 14,159,265 million of its shares. Flickr / Bill Ward Get it? Because "14,159,265" are the first eight digits after the decimal point in the number pi. The search giant showed off its numerical whimsy again in 2011, when it bid $1,902,160,540 and $2,614,972,128 for some wireless patents. REUTERS/Peter Power In case those numbers don't instantly ring a bell: They're Brun's constant and the Meissel-Mertens constant, respectively. Google didn't end up winning the patents, but it definitely mystified other bidders. In another auction, Google spent $25 million to buy the entire ".app" domain. But the clever part came when we followed up with the company about it. REUTERS/Guadalupe Pardo "We've been excited and curious about the potential for new top-level domains (TLDs) for .soy long," a Google representative told Business Insider in a pun-riddled email. "We are very .app-y with .how, at a .minna-mum, they have the potential to .foo-ward internet innovation." The company has also responded to press questions with memes. It sent The Verge this one when it revealed that a weird skull showing up in people's Gmail accounts was caused by a bug in its own in-house debugger. Google Source: The Verge Google once even got a little risqué with this response. Inverse Read the story at Inverse. And once it addressed an issue where Google Maps was showing Sauron's tower from "The Lord of the Rings" as appearing in Australia with a comment ... in Elvish. Google "If your Elvish is a bit rusty, here is a rough translation," the representative said. "We encourage users to contribute their local knowledge and updates using Google Map Maker, even the whims of Sauron will not compromise our quest to provide useful and accurate maps." Google has recruited new developers using super-cryptic challenges that people can only access through a secret website. Google And when Business Insider reached out to Google about this recruiting technique, we received the following response: " import string z=string.ascii_lowercase m=''.join([z[6],z[11],z[7],z[5]]) print(m) " The message? "GLHF," which stands for "Good luck, have fun!" A few months after Google became Alphabet in 2015, it bought the entire alphabet as a domain name, with the URL abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com. Flickr / Scott Veg "We realized we missed a few letters in abc.xyz, so we're just being thorough," a representative told Re/code. In the same vein, Alphabet also bought back a bunch of stock for $5,099,019,513.59. Thomson Reuters That's the square root of 26, the number of letters in the alphabet, times a billion. Not about numbers, but pretty funny: In its official code of conduct, Google declares itself a "dog company"... Amy Lombard/VSCO "Google's affection for our canine friends is an integral facet of our corporate culture," reads the company's code of conduct on its investor-relations site. "We like cats, but we're a dog company, so as a general rule we feel cats visiting our offices would be fairly stressed out." ... a fact that the company made sure to reference again in 2015 after the press noted that new parent company Alphabet didn't include Google's famous "don't be evil" line in its new code of conduct. Thomson Reuters After The Wall Street Journal's Alistair Barr caught the change, the company sent him a cheeky response. "Individual Alphabet companies may of course have their own codes to ensure they continue to promote compliance and great values," a Google spokesman said. "But if they start bringing cats to work, there's gonna be trouble with a capital T." When a report surfaced from WWD earlier in 2017 that Google could potentially buy Condé Nast, Google's communications team took the opportunity to write a clever response. WWD While some people found Google's response pretty funny, WWD made a wisecrack of their own, responding: "Maybe they Googled how to write a witty response" SEE ALSO: The meteoric rise of Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in photos More: Features Google Alphabet Easter eggs facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru 13 clever jokes from Google that probably went right over your head 13 clever jokes from Google that probably went right over your head Google frequently makes us giggle with the...

Twitter Facebook Snap is paying Google $400M a year for cloud services Snap has agreed to a minimum annual cloud bill roughly equal to its 2016 revenue Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 03 February, 2017 16:16 - - - - print email Comments Over the next five years, the company behind Snapchat will pay Google at least US$2 billion in cloud bills. On Thursday, Snap revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it signed a five-year contract to pay Google at least $400 million a year for cloud services. That's a steep figure, considering that Snap made roughly $404 million last year.  In return for the massive commitment, Snap will receive reduced pricing, though it’s not clear how deep the company’s discounts will be. Sinking a bunch of money into Google Cloud makes sense, because Snapchat began its life built on top of Google’s AppEngine platform-as-a-service offering. Furthermore, Snap’s commitment to Google is a massive vote of confidence in the latter’s cloud capabilities, at a time when there’s heavy competition in the cloud market. Right now, Google’s cloud is an underdog compared to Microsoft and Amazon. But being tied to a rising star in the social media landscape like Snapchat could help draw other companies to at least give Google’s platform a chance. However, the contract is not without risk. If Snap doesn’t use $400 million worth of Google Cloud services in a year, it’s still on the hook for the full value of the contract. What’s more, the company said in the filing that it uses Google for the “vast majority” of its “computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” If something goes wrong with Google Cloud, or if the tech titan gets out of the public cloud business, it could be bad news for Snap. That last scenario seems highly unlikely, considering that Google continues increasing its investment in its cloud platform. Urs Hölzle, Google’s vice president of technical infrastructure, said last year that the company plans to launch new cloud data centers at the rate of roughly one each month this year. All of this is tied to Snap’s plans to pursue an initial public offering in the near future. The filing released on Thursday is one of the company’s steps along that path. Snap’s IPO is being closely observed by the tech industry because of the company’s high-flying status. It remains to be seen how Wall Street will receive the company, especially since it’s far from profitable and its losses have widened year over year. Plus, the deal with Google means that Snap will be saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in liabilities for the foreseeable future.

On Thursday, Snap revealed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it signed a five-year contract to pay Google at least $400 million a year for cloud services. That's a steep figure, considering that Snap made roughly $404 million last year.  In return for the massive commitment, Snap will receive reduced pricing, though it’s not clear how deep the company’s discounts will be. Sinking a bunch of money into Google Cloud makes sense, because Snapchat began its life built on top of Google’s AppEngine platform-as-a-service offering. Furthermore, Snap’s commitment to Google is a massive vote of confidence in the latter’s cloud capabilities, at a time when there’s heavy competition in the cloud market. Right now, Google’s cloud is an underdog compared to Microsoft and Amazon. But being tied to a rising star in the social media landscape like Snapchat could help draw other companies to at least give Google’s platform a chance. However, the contract is not without risk. If Snap doesn’t use $400 million worth of Google Cloud services in a year, it’s still on the hook for the full value of the contract. What’s more, the company said in the filing that it uses Google for the “vast majority” of its “computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” If something goes wrong with Google Cloud, or if the tech titan gets out of the public cloud business, it could be bad news for Snap.

Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors.   TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook.   PAYING GOOGLE Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.

A billboard displays the logo of Snapchat above Times Square in New York March 12, 2015. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. PAYING GOOGLE Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG are leading the offering as underwriters.

As explained by Google: “Now when you’re searching on the Google app for a particular recipe, you’ll see a carousel of tappable suggestions to make sure you catch the best recipe to suit your taste buds and kitchen skills.” Look familiar at all? That’s because it’s almost exactly the same as Pinterest’s ‘Guided Search’. Pinterest launched Guided Search back in 2014, and they’ve been refining it ever since. The development of Guided Search has lead to Pinterest now facilitating more than two billion searches every month – in fact, just this week Pinterest announced new search ads to capitalize on this rising interest. Google clearly has some concerns about losing search traffic – which makes sense, two billion searches on another platform are two billion less its facilitating. Combine that with search activity on other platforms (Facebook sees more than 1.5 billion searches a day) and it’s no surprise that Google would be looking at ways to innovate in line with audience trends. The announcement underlines the growing relevance of social as a search and discovery tool, and an innovator in the online space. Like with Instagram copying Snapchat Stories, the platforms are starting to become more aligned, as dictated by user response - if there’s a function that works and another platform can adapt it, they will. The risk is that we lose differentiation and innovation, but the leading platforms know that they do need both of these elements to progress. It just might be that someone else comes up with them first, effectively doing the R and D work on their behalf. Google’s new ‘Recipe Search’ is available now in the Google app. Author Information Andrew Hutchinson Writer/Moderator @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. PAYING GOOGLE Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Snap shoots for the sky, promises little in $3 billion IPO pitch By Lauren Hirsch and Liana B. Baker (Reuters) - Snapchat owner Snap Inc shot the opening salvo in its $3 billion initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product.

Alex Barinka Snapchat’s net loss widened to $515 million in 2016, on revenue of $404 million, according to the prospectus filed on Thursday. Photo: Bloomberg New York: Snap Inc., the maker of the disappearing photo app Snapchat, filed publicly for an initial offering, the first US social-media company to do so since Twitter Inc. more than three years ago. The company filed with an initial size of $3 billion, a placeholder amount used to calculate fees that may change. Snap plans to raise as much as $4 billion in the IPO, people familiar with the matter have said, for a market value of as much as $25 billion. The company’s net loss widened to $515 million in 2016, on revenue of $404 million, according to the prospectus filed on Thursday. That compares with a loss of $382 million in 2015, on revenue of $59 million. Snapchat has more than 158 million daily active users, the prospectus shows. Quarterly average revenue per user on a global basis climbed to $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with 31 cents in the fourth quarter of 2015. Snap plans to use proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, the filing shows. The company said it relies on Alphabet Inc.’s Google for most of its computing, storage and bandwidth, and any disruptions to Google’s cloud functioning could “seriously” hurt its business. Snap said it plans to spend $2 billion with Alphabet over the next five years to use Google’s cloud-computing services. It also noted that because Snapchat is used primarily on mobile devices, it relies on Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc.’s operating system, over which it has no control. Snap also competes with those companies. Facebook, Twitter In addition to Google and Apple, Snap named Facebook Inc., including its WhatsApp and Instagram applications, and Twitter Inc. as significant competitors. Last year, Snapchat filed confidentially for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The Jobs Act is a venue for companies with revenue of less than $1 billion to file privately and work out details with the SEC away from the public eye. The IPO prospectus is the first opportunity for outsiders to get a closer look into a company that’s known for, among other things, its culture of secrecy. The next step will be the roadshow, in which chief executive officer Evan Spiegel and his management team will endeavor to explain the company’s strategy and prospects to potential investors. Benchmark Capital holds 12.7% of Class A shares and 22.8% of Class B shares, for a total voting power of 2.7% before the offering. Lightspeed Venture Partners holds 8.3% of Class A shares and 15% of Class B stock, for total voting power of 1.8%. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are leading the offering with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG. Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG and Allen & Co. are also on the deal. Snap plans to list its Class A shares on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol SNAP.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Jabin Botsford. By Matthew Campbell, WP Bloomberg Jan 30, 2017 at 8:29 am | Print View President Donald Trump vowed to end business as usual in Washington. Global companies are now learning just what that means. What began before his inauguration, with attempts to cajole corporations like Toyota into keeping jobs in the U.S. with critical tweets, is now escalating into a crucial test for business leaders trying to maintain the cross-border flows of people and goods that underpin commerce in the 21st century. Trump’s Friday signing of an executive order barring the citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., on the heels of his war of words with Mexico over trade, alarmed executives from big employers including General Electric, Google and Microsoft. A chaotic weekend of protests, emergency court hearings and White House rebuttals left executives with a tricky choice: speak out and risk drawing fire from an outspoken president, or stay silent and face criticism from employees and activists. GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt’s response underscored the delicate balance business will have to strike. “We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region,” he said in an internal email. While he called those staff “critical to our success,” he avoided direct criticism of Trump’s policy. GE “will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and congress and reiterate the importance of this issue,” he said. Trump’s order shut the door to nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — including refugees, visiting scholars and, at least temporarily, even permanent American residents who happened to be abroad for work or holidays. Confusion reigned in the first 48 hours of its implementation, with border agents and airlines unsure how to interpret the rules. The decision, termed a “Muslim ban” by critics, fulfills a campaign promise that even Trump allies had suggested shouldn’t be taken literally, signaling the White House’s new occupant is committed to at least some of his most controversial pledges. “We would never think this would become any kind of an issue,” Ludwig Willisch, chief executive officer of North American operations at Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, said at an automotive conference on Saturday. “This country is a melting pot, freedom of speech, everybody gets together and creates this great country. So, we were not prepared for this kind of thing.” Criticism from pockets of corporate America, which was matched by statements from the leaders of Germany, France, and Canada, stood in stark contrast to the warm words toward Trump just a week ago. Executives at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Switzerland, including AT&T’s Randall Stephenson and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon, praised Trump’s promises to overhaul corporate taxes and invest in infrastructure. Optimists suggested he would quietly drop pledges to tear up trade deals and reconsider defense commitments to allies. Trump has “had this extraordinary honeymoon where Wall Street has kind of discounted all the negative aspects,” Richard Fenning, the CEO of consultancy Control Risks, told Bloomberg Television. As companies react to the migrant ban, “perhaps that honeymoon is starting to be over,” he said. The about-face was epitomized by Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk; last week he praised Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, as a potentially “excellent” pick. On Sunday, Musk tweeted that migrants “don’t deserve to be rejected” and asked his 6.89 million Twitter followers to read the immigration order and suggest changes. On the other hand, U.S. auto companies, whose home state of Michigan has a large Arab community, have yet to make their views known. Wall Street has also largely stayed out of the fray. At some of its biggest banks, executives said they were struggling to understand whether the order will ultimately apply to employees who work in the U.S. with green cards or legal work permits. If it doesn’t hit visa holders, few major companies’ employees will be affected, according to one executive who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to comment. On Sunday, JPMorgan said it was working to assist affected staff. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said Trump’s move left him with “deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise.” The coffee chain will redouble efforts to hire as many as 10,000 refugees over five years in 75 countries, he wrote in a note to employees Sunday. Reaction was sharpest from the technology industry, with Twitter awash in reminders that Apple’s late co-founder, Steve Jobs, was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Among the first to speak out was Google CEO Sundar Pichai, himself an immigrant from India, who called the policy “painful.” Another India-born CEO, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, took to LinkedIn to highlight “the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, for the world.” Trump should expect sustained challenges from the tech industry in particular, said Ian Bremmer, CEO of political consultancy Eurasia Group, because it differs significantly with him on issues from net neutrality to immigration. “While most every CEO wants to just ‘get back to business’ after Trump’s election, that’s going to prove much harder” for technology leaders, he said. “There’s going to be a fight.” Compounding business leaders’ unease was the order’s confused implementation, which included unclear directives on how border agents should treat lawful permanent residents, and contradictory statements about how it would affect those who hold passports from two countries — for example, a dual citizen of Iran and the U.K. For now, lawyers are advising such individuals not to travel to the U.S., or to stay put if they already live there. The new rules came into force with no transition period, leaving carriers like Emirates and American Airlines Group Inc. unsure what to do with passengers booked to fly to U.S. airports, or already in the air. “We are committed to protecting our people and will provide whatever support is necessary to protect them and their families,” Michael Roth, CEO of advertising firm Interpublic Group of Cos., wrote in an email. --With assistance from Mary Schlangenstein Christopher Palmeri Gabrielle Coppola Deena Kamel Yousef Eric Pfanner Richard Clough Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell Your next Nation & World articles Starbucks to speed up hiring of vets ami ...

The submission was made in an affidavit placed before Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva by Google which has contended that even if it disables or blocks a site in its search engine, that webpage will remain on the original website and would be accessible on other search engines. This view was also echoed by the court while hearing an NRI’s plea seeking he be “delinked” from information regarding a criminal case involving his wife in which he was not a party. He has also sought removal from the records of the trial court order which mentions him. “If you post something on social media, it will never get deleted,” the court said and added if the man’s plea was allowed then all courts may have to destroy their records in matrimonial disputes. In his petition, filed through advocates Rohit Madan and Zoheb Hussain, the NRI has claimed the online availability of the criminal case, despite it being settled amicably, affects his right to privacy and reputation apart from affecting his employment opportunities. His petition has raised the question “whether data controllers or intermediaries such as Google, are required to delete information that is inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant if they receive a request for removal of such data”. Claiming that the plea was not maintainable against it or its Indian entity, Google has said, “If a content is adjudicated to be defamatory or its goes beyond the principles of law of privacy, same can be directed to be removed pursuant to being adjudicated by the court. “However, there is no reason or justification for creation of a separate statute or legal framework under right to be forgotten.” Google has also said that the petitioner should have approached the trial court, which had passed the order, to seek confidentiality and non-reporting of the order. The company has contended that the petition is not only “misconceived” but also “legally untenable”. The court, meanwhile, asked the Centre to state its stand on whether such information can be de-linked from the Internet and listed the matter for further hearing on April 24.

It’s also borrowing from the playbook of traditional media companies to create a small circle of power in its top ranks. Using three classes of stock, founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy will hold majority voting rights after an initial public offering, according to the company’s prospectus. That sort of control is rare outside the media business or the hottest technology companies. Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Photographer: J. Emilio Flores/Corbis via Getty Images The Snapchat app maker intends to go a step further than most newly public companies by selling Class A shares in its IPO with no voting rights. As a result, Spiegel and Murphy can avoid losing power while raising capital. “Snap is doing something I have not seen before: creating and issuing non-voting shares at the IPO,” said Jesse Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School. “After the IPO, Snap can issue additional non-voting stock to employees or other parties without eroding the founders’ control rights.” The use of multiple voting classes has been a common way for media moguls to retain power over their businesses while reducing their financial stakes. Rupert Murdoch uses the strategy at News Corp. and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc., as does the Ochs-Sulzberger family at the New York Times Co. and Sumner Redstone at CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. These arrangements come with their share of resistance from stockholders. Media barons have said the ownership structure is necessary to protect their companies’ editorial independence or creative freedom, said Paul Gompers, a professor at Harvard Business School. “Outside shareholders understand that the insiders have the ability to call the shots,” he said. Tech companies can thank Google for legitimizing the practice in their industry. To sell the idea to prospective investors, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin compared their business with newspaper publishers and Wall Street favorite Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which owns several papers. When Google filed to go public in 2004, they acknowledged that dual-class structures were unusual for tech companies but typical among publishers that wanted to focus on the long-term task of “serious news coverage, despite fluctuations in quarterly results,” according to their IPO paperwork. They cited the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, as well as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire. “We want Google to become an important and significant institution,” Page and Brin wrote. “That takes time, stability and independence. We bridge the media and technology industries, both of which have experienced considerable consolidation and attempted hostile takeovers.” Since then, several tech companies have adopted dual-class shares, with mixed results. Under Mark Zuckerberg’s control, Facebook Inc. has weathered several technological upheavals, including the shift from desktop to mobile, and more than tripled its share price. However, some investors still chafe at his unchallenged power. Facebook is currently trying to fend off a shareholder lawsuit, including allegations that board member Marc Andreessen helped advise Zuckerberg at the expense of shareholders. The founders of online coupon site Groupon Inc. and social game maker Zynga Inc. employed dual-class shares to give top executives majority voting control. Each founding CEO was ousted less than two years after their IPOs, and their market values have dropped by more than two-thirds since going public in 2011. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Snap is asking investors for even more faith by introducing a third class of stock. The Class A shares have no votes; the Class B have one vote per share; and the Class C have 10, according to the filing. Spiegel and Murphy own the Class C stock, giving them “the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval,” the company wrote. That could nix a merger or acquisition of Snap that other shareholders might support and let the founders make other long-term strategy decisions that may not work out, it warned. “To our knowledge, no other company has completed an initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock exchange,” Snap wrote. “We cannot predict whether this structure and the concentrated control it affords Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy will result in a lower trading price.” Google, now owned by Alphabet Inc., was sued over the issuance of non-voting stock and later for creating a third class of stock cementing Page and Brin’s voting control for good. It settled both cases. “You’ll continue to see this trend happening until there is something really negative as a result,” said Thomas Ivey, partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The money-making side of Snap is fairly young, but it’s increasingly positioning itself to take advertising dollars from media companies. It’s aiming to keep the eyes of its largely millennial audience glued to its app, interspersing ads into video reels and in publishers’ Snapchat content. The company has warned that its financial performance will be “lumpy” as it continues to grow, people familiar with the matter have said. In its IPO filing, Snap reported a 2016 net loss of $515 million, versus a loss of $373 million in 2015. Snap is asking potential investors to trust a couple of twentysomethings to figure out how to capitalize on user engagement, keep growing and eventually reach profitability -- without shareholder intervention.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Friday, February 3, 2017, 8:00 [IST] Mobile malware is on the rise and your device could be at risk. These tips could help you stay safe and keep your personal information out of the hands of cybercriminals. Well, if you currently analyze the smartphone market then you can see that the adoption rate of mobile devices has skyrocketed and evidently Android is leading the way. The open-source operating system that has been developed by Google is now found on more than half of all smartphones. In fact, according to a report from Strategy Analytics, about nine in 10 smartphones shipped in the latest quarter ran Google's mobile operating system. In addition, Android accounted for a record 87.5% of the 375 million smartphones shipped in the third quarter, ending September 30, 2016. So you can clearly see from the stats that Android continues to dominate the smartphone market. However, because of its popularity and a massive user base, it has now caught the attention of cybercriminals. Currently, Android mobiles are being targeted by virus and malware developers. Moreover, these malware developers are targeting Android mobile devices to accomplish their goals or illegally obtain personal information from Android owners. SEE ALSO: Android 7.1.2 adds swipe for notifications gesture to Nexus 5X and 6P While this is the present scenario in the Android world, with the advancement of mobile technology, mobile malware and viruses are becoming more advanced and thus are infecting millions of mobile worldwide. On the other hand, it is highly recommended that you stick to apps from the official Google Play Store only. If you do you are unlikely to encounter any of the dangerous malware out there. Just to let you know, malware lives and thrives in unofficial app stores, which are largely unregulated. Having said all that, here are the worst malware types you should be aware of and also keep your mobile away. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Ransomware Ransomware is basically a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom to be paid off to re-gain access back to your files. An example of ransomware would be an app called Simplocker. Simplocker is basically a Trojan malware that disguises itself as an app suitable for adults only. If Simplocker is downloaded and as it enters your smartphone it scans your smartphone's SD card for documents, images and videos. After the scan is complete it encrypts those files using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Then it displays a fake FBI message in Russian that accuses the victim of downloading and viewing child pornography on their device. And to get the files back, Simplocker demands some amount to be paid within 24 hrs. It claims that failing to pay the ransom will result in removing all of the files that it has encrypted. However, it has been said that the app doesn't have the functionality to do so. If you are infected with Simplocker, you can download Simplocker Decryptor that was created by ESET. Another type of ransomware which has gained lot notoriety is the "svpeng", which combines ransomware with credit card theft. Svpeng works by presenting a screen to input credit card details every time a user accesses Google Play Store, which then sends the credit card details to the criminal behind this malware. Moreover, once spveng is on your smartphone, it would check to see whether you have a banking app installed. The good news is the Russian police arrested the creator of spveng in April after he stole more than 50 million rubles ($930, 000) and infected more than 350, 000 Android devices. Mobile Shutting Down Android/PowerOffHijack discovered by AVG, is a type of malware that takes control of the process responsible for shutting down your smartphone. With this malware, your phone appears to be off when in fact it's on and functioning. Interestingly, the malware even plays the shutdown animation to show that your device is really turning off. And what this power off hijack really does is it secretly takes pictures, makes calls, and sends messages while you think that your phone is turned off. On the bright side, this type of malware only affects Android versions under 5.0, requires root access and has been found only on apps outside of Google Play Store.

According to experts, "HummingBad" has already attacked more than 10 million Android devices worldwide. Dangerously, this malware has the power to take control of devices; it forces users to click advertisements and download apps by using a multistage attack chain. Moreover, the malware tries to gain access to your device through certain websites and infect it. Once it gets through the device it then tries to gain root access to the device by running software. If it succeeds to get the root access, the attackers will gain full access to your mobile. In case if the malware fails to gain root access, it uses a fake system through which it sends an update notification to your mobile to get system-level permission. Viking Horde This virus can be pretty devastating and harmful for your device. Why we say that is because "Viking Horde" has been created for Google Play Store apps. Through these apps, the virus creates a place in Android devices. Moreover, the virus can infect both rooted and non-rooted devices. So, whenever a user downloads an infected app from Google Play Store, the device gets infected by the malware. The risks of rooted devices are bigger compared to non-rooted devices. In rooted devices, "Viking Horde" installs software and executes code remotely to get access to the mobile data. If it does, then the data of your mobile is at risk. The reason behind launching this app is for conducting ad clicks, spam messages, and others.

And with the existence of such sites these attackers are stealing users' credentials or worse. The fact that mobile devices come with smaller screen is making malicious phishing techniques easier to hide from users. As such it is less sophisticated on mobile devices than PCs. Moreover, phishing schemes use rogue mobile apps, programs which can be considered "trojanized", while hiding their true intent as a system update, marketing offer or game. Some of these malware infect legitimate apps also with malicious code which can be only discovered after installing. Malware Symptoms Having looked at the different types of mobile malware, you might have an idea on how they spread and infect devices. While the do come in various ways, they all can produce similar symptoms. Well, signs of a malware infection can include unwanted behaviors and degradation of device performance. Stability issues such as frozen apps, failure to reboot and difficulty connecting to the network are also common. In addition, mobile malware can drain your battery or processing power, hijack the browser, send unauthorized SMS messages, freeze or spoil the device entirely. SEE ALSO: Google rolls out Android Nougat 7.1.2 Developer Preview for Pixel and Nexus phones How to be Safe? So if you are wondering how you can avoid and be safe from such malware then there are several best practices that all mobile users should follow to prevent Android malware infections. In essence, some malware cases may require special prevention and treatment methods, but following these recommendations will greatly increase a user's protection from a wide range of mobile malware. #1 Download apps only from official app stores like Apple's App Store or Google Play. The vast majority of malicious apps are found on unofficial app stores or websites, many based in China or Russia. #2 Do some research on the developer and their reputation. Read user ratings, paying special attention to reviews from disgruntled users, and seek out app recommendations from reputable sources. #3 Think twice before granting "permissions" when installing new apps for the first time. Often, malicious app developers are counting on that level of carelessness to sneak malware onto your device. Always make sure to carefully read the end user agreement before clicking to understand exactly what permissions the app is asking for. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Snapchat owner Snap Inc shot the opening salvo in its US$3 billion initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to US$514.6 million in 2016 from US$372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between US$20 billion to US$25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling US$130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc, Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned US$503,205 in salary, with a US$1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned US$241,539 last year with a US$5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received US$145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. PAYING GOOGLE Snap had US$404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from US$58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of US$459 million, compared with US$292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google US$2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG are leading the offering as underwriters.

The tech giant is creating a $2 million crisis fund for immigrant causes, which can be matched by up to $2 million from Google employees, potentially amounting to $4 million in donations that would benefit four organizations. Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, detailed the fund in a memo sent out to all staff on Sunday, reported USA Today. A Google spokeswoman confirmed the report Monday morning. The fund's creation follows Pichai's criticism of President Donald Trump's immigration order, issued Friday. The executive order puts in place a temporary ban on entry into the US by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries as a deterrent to potential acts of terrorism. It created uncertainty at many airports over the weekend as federal agencies worked to interpret the requirements and sparked widespread protests across the US by people who saw the move as excessive and "un-American." The immigration order has garnered strongly worded criticism from across the tech industry, with Apple, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook and many others joining the chorus of voices condemning Trump's decision. The fund will be Google's largest crisis campaign ever. It would provide funds to the American Civil Liberties Union, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, International Rescue Committee and UNHCR. Google also encouraged more than 100 employees to return from traveling overseas immediately for fear they would not be allowed back into the US.

Instead, Korematsu, like 115,000 other people of Japanese descent living in the US, was ordered to an internment camp per an executive order signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Korematsu refused to hand himself and instead went into hiding. He was arrested in 1942 and sent to Central Utah War Relocation Center until the war ended in 1945. The timing of the doodle doesn't seem to be a coincidence. On Sunday, Google announced that it's launching a crisis fund to help immigrant causes in the wake of Donald Trump's immigration order, which bans citizens of seven Muslim countries from entering the US for 90 days. The order, issued Friday, also bans refugees from entering the country for 120 days and places a permanent ban on refugees from Syria. Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, has been openly critical of Trump's executive order. One of the organizations its immigration fund is set to benefit is the American Civil Liberties Union, which in the 1940s fought to prevent Korematsu from being incarcerated. Plenty of people had thoughts on the doodle's subject and timing. President Gerald Ford officially overturned and apologized for the order that affected Korematsu in 1976, and his conviction was also finally overturned, but not until 1983. In 1998 President Bill Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contribution to fighting for civil rights. Clicking through from the doodle pulls up a quote from Korematsu. "If you have the feeling that something is wrong, don't be afraid to speak up," it says. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

According to Re/code, the tech giants are reaching out to other tech companies, including Uber and Stripe, as well as companies outside of the tech space. BREAKING: Big tech giants like Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook along with CPG, manufacturing cos working on letter opposing Trump ban — Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) February 2, 2017 Tone and Approach Re/code published a draft of a letter the companies plan to send the White House. That draft directly makes the case that America was built on immigration. It indirectly makes the case that the rule of law and predictability is important to business. It also strikes a markedly conciliatory tone, making much of changes to the initial executive order forced by courts. The companies also make repeated offers to work with the White House to find better ways of achieving the stated goals of the Trump administration. Social media reaction to the news has been mixed. Many have praised the companies for taking a stand, while others have criticized the letter as inadequate. @karaswisher @mumper A letter you say? I sure hope it’s a sharply worded correspondence. — Rod Von Hugendong (@Oxpocket) February 2, 2017 Supporters of Donald Trump have, naturally, criticized and attacked the companies (and Re/code) in any number of ways. Corporate Action Executives at all the above-listed companies have criticized the executive order. Apple CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that his company was weighing its legal options. It’s possible—perhaps even likely—that this letter is the first public-facing action of a coalition. The tech giants want business response to be broad and comprehensive. It’s one thing for the White House to dismiss Silicon Valley response as a product of an irrelevant Left Coast. It’s another for companies from all over America to be part of the message. But…the tech world is leading this for a reason. Being left of center isn’t a big risk in Silicon Valley, but there are obviously many parts of the country where it is, regardless of the business case to be made against the executive order. With that in mind, getting companies to sign off on a mealy-mouthed letter is a far easier first step than getting them to sign on to, say, a lawsuit. Text of the Draft, from Re/Code Dear President Trump, Since the country’s birth, America has been the land of opportunity — welcoming newcomers and giving them the chance to build families, careers and businesses in the United States. We are a nation made stronger by immigrants. As entrepreneurs and business leaders, our ability to grow our companies and create jobs depends on the contributions of immigrants from all backgrounds. We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today’s security needs and keeps our country safe. We are concerned, however, that your recent executive order will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United States and contribute to our country’s success. In a global economy, it is critical that we continue to attract the best and brightest from around the world. We welcome the changes your administration has made in recent days in how the Department of Homeland Security will implement the executive order, and we stand ready to help your administration identify other opportunities to ensure that our employees can travel with predictability and without undue delay. Our nation’s compassion is a part of what makes it exceptional, and we are committed to helping your administration identify approaches for thorough screening without a blanket suspension of admissions under the U.S. Refugee Admissions program. While security and vetting procedures can and should always be subject to continuous evaluation and improvement, a blanket suspension is not the right approach. Similarly, we stand ready to identify ways of helping to achieve your stated goal of bringing clarity to the future of the 750,000 Dreamers in this country under the protections of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in a way “that will make people happy and proud.” Removing these protections by barring renewals would effectively end the program and eliminate the ability for these Dreamers to work and live without the fear of deportation. The business community shares your commitment to growing the American economy and expanding job creation across the country. We hire both thousands of Americans and some of the most talented people from abroad, who work together to help our companies succeed and expand our overall employment. As you contemplate changes to the nation’s complex and interconnected immigration policies, whether business and employment-based visas, refugees or DACA, we hope that you will use us as a resource to help achieve immigration policies that both support the work of American businesses and reflect American values.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Snap shoots for the sky, promises little in $3 bln IPO pitch By Reuters Published: 21:31 EST, 2 February 2017 | Updated: 21:31 EST, 2 February 2017 e-mail By Lauren Hirsch and Liana B. Baker Feb 2 (Reuters) - Snapchat owner Snap Inc shot the opening salvo in its $3 billion initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. "What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money," said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost. Snap had confidentially registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO late last year. It kept the filing under such tight wraps, even some of its IPO underwriters had not seen it prior to publication on Thursday, sources familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Snap said in the IPO registration document published on Thursday it would become the first U.S. company to go public with shares on offer not granting voting rights to stock market investors. Its founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, will keep control of the company. Snap could be valued at between $20 billion to $25 billion, according to sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. That would give the company the richest valuation in a U.S. technology IPO since Facebook Inc. Snap, which launched itself in 2012 with an app that sends disappearing messages, rebranded itself last year as a camera company and started selling $130 video camera glasses. It generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, seeking to challenge the dominance of internet giants such as Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google. "The industry has been crying out for new advertising units" says Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of ad agency Deep Focus, referring to the tight hold Facebook and Google have on the digital advertising marketplace. In its IPO registration document, Snap cited Apple Inc , Google, Twitter Inc, Facebook and its photo-sharing platform Instagram as its competitors. TIGHT CONTROL Spiegel, the 26-year-old Snap co-founder, last year earned $503,205 in salary, with a $1 million bonus. Imran Khan, Snapchat's chief strategy officer whom it hired from investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG in 2014, earned $241,539 last year with a $5.2 million bonus. In 2015, Khan also received $145.3 million worth of Snap shares as a sign-up bonus. Spiegel and Murphy will maintain tight control over Snap's stock through a unique three-share class structure. The structure will give Spiegel and Murphy the right of 10 votes for every share. Existing investors will have one vote for each of their shares, while new investors will have no voting rights. Snap said it couldn't predict if the structure would "result in a lower trading price or greater fluctuations" in the stock. Keeping tight control is common in companies closely associated with their founders, who often prefer to grow their business without being questioned by a broad array of investors. Still, offering a class of stock with no votes in an IPO is unprecedented. Though the structure has drawn some criticism for not giving stock market investors the opportunity to have input, some people close to the company have argued that investors can "vote with their feet" by not buying into the IPO if they are not comfortable with the arrangements. "Investors have to decide, am I going to avail myself of the opportunity to buy the stock, and forget about the fact that somewhere down the road they are likely going to run into trouble?" said James McRitchie, an independent corporate governance activist who has pressed for more equal voting rights at companies including Facebook. PAYING GOOGLE Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from "hosting fees" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. "They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses," said SharesPost's Kulkarni. Some companies such as Facebook have their own hosting platforms, though this model can be more costly. Facebook's Instagram, which recently introduced disappearing video content similar to Snapchat, had 600 million users as of late last year. Like Snapchat, Instagram sells advertising on its platform. Snap's aggressive expansion is reflected in its staff numbers. By the end of last year, it had increased its number of employees to 1,859 from 600 in 2015. Snap said it would use the proceeds from its IPO for general purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Snap said it will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SNAP. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG are leading the offering as underwriters.

By: Samden Sherpa Published: Friday, February 3, 2017, 8:00 [IST] Mobile malware is on the rise and your device could be at risk. These tips could help you stay safe and keep your personal information out of the hands of cybercriminals. Well, if you currently analyze the smartphone market then you can see that the adoption rate of mobile devices has skyrocketed and evidently Android is leading the way. The open-source operating system that has been developed by Google is now found on more than half of all smartphones. In fact, according to a report from Strategy Analytics, about nine in 10 smartphones shipped in the latest quarter ran Google's mobile operating system. In addition, Android accounted for a record 87.5% of the 375 million smartphones shipped in the third quarter, ending September 30, 2016. So you can clearly see from the stats that Android continues to dominate the smartphone market. However, because of its popularity and a massive user base, it has now caught the attention of cybercriminals. Currently, Android mobiles are being targeted by virus and malware developers. Moreover, these malware developers are targeting Android mobile devices to accomplish their goals or illegally obtain personal information from Android owners. SEE ALSO: Android 7.1.2 adds swipe for notifications gesture to Nexus 5X and 6P While this is the present scenario in the Android world, with the advancement of mobile technology, mobile malware and viruses are becoming more advanced and thus are infecting millions of mobile worldwide. On the other hand, it is highly recommended that you stick to apps from the official Google Play Store only. If you do you are unlikely to encounter any of the dangerous malware out there. Just to let you know, malware lives and thrives in unofficial app stores, which are largely unregulated. Having said all that, here are the worst malware types you should be aware of and also keep your mobile away. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Ransomware Ransomware is basically a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom to be paid off to re-gain access back to your files. An example of ransomware would be an app called Simplocker. Simplocker is basically a Trojan malware that disguises itself as an app suitable for adults only. If Simplocker is downloaded and as it enters your smartphone it scans your smartphone's SD card for documents, images and videos. After the scan is complete it encrypts those files using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Then it displays a fake FBI message in Russian that accuses the victim of downloading and viewing child pornography on their device. And to get the files back, Simplocker demands some amount to be paid within 24 hrs. It claims that failing to pay the ransom will result in removing all of the files that it has encrypted. However, it has been said that the app doesn't have the functionality to do so. If you are infected with Simplocker, you can download Simplocker Decryptor that was created by ESET. Another type of ransomware which has gained lot notoriety is the "svpeng", which combines ransomware with credit card theft. Svpeng works by presenting a screen to input credit card details every time a user accesses Google Play Store, which then sends the credit card details to the criminal behind this malware. Moreover, once spveng is on your smartphone, it would check to see whether you have a banking app installed. The good news is the Russian police arrested the creator of spveng in April after he stole more than 50 million rubles ($930, 000) and infected more than 350, 000 Android devices. Mobile Shutting Down Android/PowerOffHijack discovered by AVG, is a type of malware that takes control of the process responsible for shutting down your smartphone. With this malware, your phone appears to be off when in fact it's on and functioning. Interestingly, the malware even plays the shutdown animation to show that your device is really turning off. And what this power off hijack really does is it secretly takes pictures, makes calls, and sends messages while you think that your phone is turned off. On the bright side, this type of malware only affects Android versions under 5.0, requires root access and has been found only on apps outside of Google Play Store.

According to experts, "HummingBad" has already attacked more than 10 million Android devices worldwide. Dangerously, this malware has the power to take control of devices; it forces users to click advertisements and download apps by using a multistage attack chain. Moreover, the malware tries to gain access to your device through certain websites and infect it. Once it gets through the device it then tries to gain root access to the device by running software. If it succeeds to get the root access, the attackers will gain full access to your mobile. In case if the malware fails to gain root access, it uses a fake system through which it sends an update notification to your mobile to get system-level permission. Viking Horde This virus can be pretty devastating and harmful for your device. Why we say that is because "Viking Horde" has been created for Google Play Store apps. Through these apps, the virus creates a place in Android devices. Moreover, the virus can infect both rooted and non-rooted devices. So, whenever a user downloads an infected app from Google Play Store, the device gets infected by the malware. The risks of rooted devices are bigger compared to non-rooted devices. In rooted devices, "Viking Horde" installs software and executes code remotely to get access to the mobile data. If it does, then the data of your mobile is at risk. The reason behind launching this app is for conducting ad clicks, spam messages, and others. SEE ALSO: Google Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will not get Android Nougat 7.1.2 update Phishing Apps While mobile browsing of the internet is growing with smartphone and tablet penetration, fraudsters and cyber criminals are now creating mobile phishing sites that look similar to a legitimate service. And with the existence of such sites these attackers are stealing users' credentials or worse. The fact that mobile devices come with smaller screen is making malicious phishing techniques easier to hide from users. As such it is less sophisticated on mobile devices than PCs. Moreover, phishing schemes use rogue mobile apps, programs which can be considered "trojanized", while hiding their true intent as a system update, marketing offer or game. Some of these malware infect legitimate apps also with malicious code which can be only discovered after installing. Malware Symptoms Having looked at the different types of mobile malware, you might have an idea on how they spread and infect devices. While the do come in various ways, they all can produce similar symptoms. Well, signs of a malware infection can include unwanted behaviors and degradation of device performance. Stability issues such as frozen apps, failure to reboot and difficulty connecting to the network are also common. In addition, mobile malware can drain your battery or processing power, hijack the browser, send unauthorized SMS messages, freeze or spoil the device entirely. SEE ALSO: Google rolls out Android Nougat 7.1.2 Developer Preview for Pixel and Nexus phones How to be Safe? So if you are wondering how you can avoid and be safe from such malware then there are several best practices that all mobile users should follow to prevent Android malware infections. In essence, some malware cases may require special prevention and treatment methods, but following these recommendations will greatly increase a user's protection from a wide range of mobile malware. #1 Download apps only from official app stores like Apple's App Store or Google Play. The vast majority of malicious apps are found on unofficial app stores or websites, many based in China or Russia. #2 Do some research on the developer and their reputation. Read user ratings, paying special attention to reviews from disgruntled users, and seek out app recommendations from reputable sources. #3 Think twice before granting "permissions" when installing new apps for the first time. Often, malicious app developers are counting on that level of carelessness to sneak malware onto your device. Always make sure to carefully read the end user agreement before clicking to understand exactly what permissions the app is asking for. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: CLOUD One thing holding back Snap in China? Google Jordan Novet@jordannovet February 2, 2017 6:34 PM Tags: Alphabet, Google, infrastructure as a service, public cloud, Snap, Snap IPO, Snapchat Above: Google signage Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat An interesting cloud story is tucked inside Snap Inc.’s S-1 filing for an initial public offering (IPO). It turns out that Google, considered the No. 3 player in the public cloud infrastructure market, has a hefty $5 billion deal with the company behind messaging app Snapchat. According to the terms of the deal, Snapchat must spend $400 million on the Google Cloud each year beginning on January 30, 2017, and if that doesn’t happen, for each of the first four years, as much as 15 percent of the $400 million can be rolled over to the following year. Assuming that Snap will do the full $400 million each year, that works out to more than $33 million per month — a huge cloud spend. For some context, public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) last year succeeded in getting Salesforce to agree to spend $400 million over four years. It’s not as if Snapchat is new addition to Google’s servers. The app has been hosted on Google infrastructure for four years or more; nowadays the “vast majority” of Snapchat runs on Google, according to today’s filing. The thing is, while Google has been opening up new data centers around the world for its public cloud, it doesn’t currently have the geographical reach that other clouds do. To narrow down the focus to one country, it does not have a footprint in China. AWS does, and so does Microsoft Azure. Both rely on partners based in China (Sinnet and 21Vianet, respectively) to operate their data center infrastructure in the country. But more generally, Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010 as a result of censorship issues. “Access to Google, which currently powers our infrastructure, is restricted in China, and we do not know if we will be able to enter the market in a manner acceptable to the Chinese government,” Snap said in the filing. Plus, Snap only recently opened an office in China. “We have very limited access to the China market, as we have not yet established an operating presence in China to support Snapchat,” Snap said in the filing. China is important because it’s a place where there’s lots of advertising spend — second only to the U.S., according to the IDC data Snap included in its filing — and that’s important because Snap’s primary revenue stream is from ads. So it’s probably safe to say Google not being there is at least an inconvenience. Because of the contract Snap signed with Google, which comes with discounts but does allow for a reduction in payment in the event of “a significant revenue decline,” it’s not really in a position to very easily transfer to another cloud or hosting provider. “Any transition of such services to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement, and may cause us to incur significant time and expense,” Snap said in the filing. But that isn’t to say Snap isn’t being smart and preparing for a future without Google. “We are currently negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations. In the future, we may invest in building our own infrastructure to better serve our customers,” Snap said.* That’s not unheard of. Dropbox switched off AWS and onto its own infrastructure. But it is, I would guess, a few years away. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. *It’s got to be either AWS or Azure. If you know, tell me!

Tsering Topgyal The Associated Press i By the Editorial Board There is surely no shortage of U.S. workers in Silicon Valley. But if President Donald Trump wants to get more Americans hired in tech, the solution isn’t to threaten work visas or to ban travel by immigrants and refugees. He should tackle the problem at its source – in American public high schools, where math, science and technology education lags that of other nations. The problem isn’t that employers won’t “hire American,” as Trump puts it. It’s that too many American students, disproportionately students of color, aren’t being adequately prepared. Trump has been fragging America’s tech sector in what can only be described as an act of epic stupidity, economically speaking. His executive order last weekend to restrict visas and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries sowed international fear and chaos, and struck at the secret weapon that gives U.S. tech its edge – the ability to freely recruit and retain top talent internationally. Immigrants are inextricably bound up with the success of tech in this country. Elon Musk came from South Africa to build Tesla, SpaceX and PayPal. Pierre Omidyar of eBay was born in Paris to Iranian parents. Yahoo founder Jerry Yang came from Taiwan at age 12 knowing one word of English. Apple’s Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian refugee. But as if throwing huge employers such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft into turmoil weren’t sufficient, the administration said this week it is drafting another executive order aimed at severely limiting visas for foreign workers. The H-1B skilled visas most commonly requested in tech do need some tweaks, in part to stop offshore outsourcing firms from undercutting U.S. workers, but there’s no earthly reason that shouldn’t be done the normal way, by Congress. Trump’s edicts – one already in force, the other, for now, only under discussion – have been denounced by tech executives in California and across the country, and for good moral and financial reasons. Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin, a former Soviet refugee, joined demonstrators at San Francisco International Airport. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said his company was exploring its own legal challenges, and joined Microsoft and Expedia in support of a Washington state lawsuit. Travis Kalanick, the head of Uber, quit Trump’s business council this week amid threats of boycott. Several top executives are circulating an open letter asking Trump to work reasonably with them on this issue. But reason doesn’t seem to be driving policy in this administration. Last weekend’s train wreck of an order was said to have been the brainchild of two of Trump’s most ideologically rigid lieutenants – Steve Bannon, a self-described “nationalist” and former head of the alt-right platform Breitbart, and Stephen Miller, a former aide to Trump’s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions. Bannon has told audiences he believes the “Judeo-Christian West” is preparing for a war with Muslims, and has complained that American “civic society” is being overrun by Asian CEOs and immigrant tech workers. Miller’s speeches and writings are riddled with similar crackpottery. Such bigotry has no place in U.S. policy, let alone the hiring practices in one of the nation’s biggest job engines. But even if their motives weren’t suspect, cutting off foreign visas won’t make engineers out of Rust Belt dropouts. At last count, the U.S. was projected to have 1.3 million unfilled tech jobs over the next five years. One analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers reported more than 209,000 unfilled jobs in cybersecurity. The reason? Not enough skilled U.S. workers to adequately fill them, not even in California. So few high school students understand computer science here, in fact, that last year Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law to address the problem. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is still struggling to get computer science included in the core high school curriculum for University of California admissions. The obvious solution, of course, would be to support public schools with federal money – an irony, given the private school zealot who is Trump’s pick for education secretary. So tech executives should speak up, to the extent they can without risking mean Trump tweets that tank their stock prices. Meanwhile, Trump might need another wall, just to keep Silicon Valley in Silicon Valley. The friendly Canadian business climate is the talk of the tech sector, suddenly.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it (Reuters) By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg February 2 at 8:02 PM Follow @lizzadwoskin Follow @craigtimberg SAN FRANCISCO — The tech industry’s opposition to President Trump escalated Thursday as corporate leaders drafted a letter warning of the economic risks of his immigration policies, Uber’s chief executive quit an administration advisory board and Lyft pulled its ads from Breitbart News, the site founded by the White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. The developments followed remarks this week from Apple, Amazon and other companies, which said they were exploring legal action against Trump’s executive order that temporarily barred travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries. Amazon and Expedia also joined a lawsuit brought by the state of Washington against the immigration ban. The actions underscored rising alarm along the West Coast’s tech archipelago from Silicon Valley to Seattle that Trump’s policies threaten a sector that has long been a driver of new wealth and innovation in an otherwise tepid economy. After attempting to reach out to Trump by attending a meeting at his hotel in New York, tech companies are preparing themselves for a high-stakes confrontation with the president. Trump’s quest to tighten immigration has struck particularly hard at left-leaning Silicon Valley, which relies on a flow of high-level talent from India, east Asia and elsewhere and sees diversity as core to its identity as an innovation hub. People shout slogans at the protest. (Kate Munsch/Reuters) “People come to Silicon Valley so they can build the American Dream, and this is one of the last places where the American Dream still kind of works,” said Jonathan Nelson, chief executive of Hackers/Founders, a 300,000-person global network of entrepreneurs and engineers. “If this happens, you’re going to completely kill the next 10 years of tech companies.” Some tech companies are now considering whether to move jobs out of the United States to places with more relaxed immigration policies, such as Vancouver, B.C., and Dublin, which have made clear they would welcome an influx of U.S.-based immigrant technology workers. “One of the sad ironies of this is that an administration that purports to understand business is threatening one of the core pillars of what has made Silicon Valley so successful and an engine of economic growth,” said Matt Mahan, chief executive of the social networking start-up Brigade. Tensions have been building since Friday night, when tech executives, including Apple’s Tim Cook and Google’s Sundar Pichai, began publicly denouncing the immigration ban. Protesters flooded U.S. airports and held rallies outside Google’s offices. In a flurry of emails and late-night phone calls among top executives, the industry began preparing a range of responses. A little more than half of U.S. start-ups that are estimated to be worth more than $1 billion were founded by immigrants, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington think tank. And Silicon Valley is littered with immigrant success stories: Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, is an immigrant from India; Google co-founder Sergey Brin is a refugee from the former Soviet Union; and Omid Kordestani, Twitter’s executive chairman, was born in Iran. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant, leading Cook to say, in a letter denouncing Trump’s travel ban, that the company “wouldn’t exist” if such a ban had been in place. Sam Altman, the president of Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator, called the reaction to the immigration ban a watershed moment in which the tech industry — rivals and all — made the unusual move of coming together and drawing a line in the sand against a sitting president. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) The steps taken by tech companies become more urgent after a draft of what appeared to be a Trump administration executive order limiting workers on H-1B visas circulated widely in Silicon Valley this week. The leaked order indicated the administration could cancel the annual lottery through which technology companies sponsor tens of thousands of engineers, as well as a special visa for start-up founders who want to move to the United States. A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the leaked order or confirm its veracity. But White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters this week that the administration expects to scrutinize work visa programs closely as part of its immigration agenda. “There’s an overall need to look at all of these programs,” said Spicer. “And you’ll see both through executive action and through comprehensive measures a way to address immigration as a whole and the visa program.” As tensions built throughout the week, Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick and Tesla’s Elon Musk, who serve on Trump’s economic council, faced intense pressure to disavow their work with the administration, according to people familiar with the situation. Both have insisted, until now, that being at the table, and having the opportunity to influence the direction of the country, was better than not being at it. But on Thursday, Kalanick said that he had spoken with Trump and told him that he would step down. Musk declined requests for comment. Kalanick’s calculus changed after the company faced a huge outcry from the public for not joining Saturday’s protests at airports. In his letter, Kalanick said he made his decision after hearing the stories of Uber employees and drivers, in particular those of Emil Michael, a refugee from Egypt, and Thuan Pham, a refugee from Vietnam. Kalanick wrote that the executive order was hurting people across America and hurting Uber’s ability to make positive change in the country. “The implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the Administration’s agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are,” he wrote. “There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that.” In separate letter, more than 115 Silicon Valley start-up founders and venture capitalists pleaded with the administration to cancel the immigration ban. “Silicon Valley flourishes because of our free and open culture of entrepreneurship and excellence,” they wrote. “The President’s actions yesterday not only negatively affect Tech’s competitiveness, they hurt the U.S. economy overall.” Another letter from executives at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and others is also being drafted, according to a person familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private matter. In interviews, technology company officials said they were looking into relocating people to overseas offices in Ireland and other places in Europe. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were still underway. “Tech companies are telling me they would rather set up subsidiaries or set up their companies in countries that are more welcoming and have friendlier immigration laws,” said Priya Alagiri, an immigration lawyer based in San Francisco who represents start-ups and tech firms. “They go to great lengths [to keep immigrant workers] because the workers are so highly talented and highly skilled.” Meanwhile, Lyft, Uber’s ride-hailing rival, said Thursday that it was pulling ads from Breitbart News, following the actions of hundreds of other companies, including Lenovo, HP and T-Mobile. Many of the firms criticized the site as being an anti-immigrant and racist platform. “One of Lyft’s core values is to uplift and support one another in all that we do,” said Adrian Durbin, Lyft’s director of communications. “We strive to ensure that our advertisements appear only on sites that share this value.” Timberg reported from Washington.

Flock, a new messaging and collaboration platform with users in some 25,000 global organizations, has announced the immediate availability of the Flock Fake News Detector. This first-of-its-kind feature empowers Flock users to stop false and misleading information from being introduced into their messaging/collaboration environments and decision-making processes. "It became imperative and important for us, and even more so for us in an organizational context, that we are able to flag and provide information to both senders and recipients on the veracity and accuracy of the news and the links that they post," Flock CEO Bhavin Turakhia told eWEEK. Google's efforts to convince potential business customers about the enterprise readiness of its cloud services continued this week, this time with a focus on security. The company on Tuesday announced what it described as new enterprise-grade controls for its range of G Suite applications that include business email, calendar, spreadsheet, storage and other applications. At a high level, the new features are designed to provide G Suite administrators with more powerful access control and data loss prevention capabilities. With this week’s update, Google has also connected its BigQuery data analytics engine to Gmail making it easier for administrators to conduct analytics and gain insight from security data. The widely-used Dridex banking trojan has been modified by attackers to bypass a fundamental protection on Windows that lets users block the installation of potentially malicious programs, according to security firm Flashpoint. The modification, which first appeared on Jan. 25, allows the program to silently execute on systems where the user is part of an administrative group, according to Vitali Kremez, senior cyber-crime intelligence analyst at Flashpoint, a threat intelligence firm. The attack by itself does not escalate privileges and so may not work on limited user accounts. Dridex is one of the top-5 programs used by online criminals to gain access to victims’ financial accounts. Dridex is the fourth most encountered banking trojan, accounting for 11 percent of financial malware encountered by IBM’s X-Force research labs. Hewlett-Packard Inc. came out Jan. 31 with two new mobile thin clients that certainly look like any other laptop one can find at Best Buy or on any online retail site you can name. There's a different twist this time, however: One of the two thin clients doesn't come installed with Windows 10. The HP mt43 and HP mt20 machines are aimed a range of enterprise use cases and designed to bring enough computing power and graphics capabilities to users working on tasks in cloud-computing environments. The HP mt20 also offers a battery designed for daylong work to go with a pre-installed Linux-based OS. The 14-inch-screen HP mt43 Mobile Thin Client is crafted with premium materials for a thin, light look and feel; it features a backlit keyboard, large-format glass touchpad and HP's Bang & Olufsen audio system       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

 A little known part of Amazon is growing fast — and directly competes with Google and Facebook Eugene Kim Feb. 2, 2017, 7:55 PM 11,978 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (L) with Google cofounder Larry Page and Facebook COO Sheryl SandbergAP Amazon may have a surprise winner in a service that directly competes with Google and Facebook's bread-and-butter business: online advertising. According to Amazon's latest earnings, the "other" revenue from its North America business — believed to be mostly comprised of its online advertising sales — saw the biggest year-over-year jump of any part of Amazon, at 60% in 2016. It recorded $1.3 billion in annual revenue. Although that's tiny compared to Google's $80 billion in ad revenue, it shows Amazon has been quietly ramping up its online advertising offerings, and could one day be a major threat in the industry. In fact, during Amazon's earnings call with investors on Thursday, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan pointed out this growth, asking where the company sees its advertising business going longer term. Amazon's CFO Brian Olsavsky didn't share much, stressing it's "very early," but did agree its online advertising business is a "good strategy" for the company. "Our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. We think that’s a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience," Olsavsky said during the call. Olsavsky also said "sponsored product" ads are "off to a great start" and a "very effective way" to reach interested customers, while adding the company's working on some pre-roll video ads as well. "For the most part, we like the progression. We are balancing customer experience with advertising at all times, and we like the team that’s working on it," he added. Overlooked part of the business Although Amazon rarely talks about its sprawling advertising business, there's been some speculation that it could end up becoming a major part of the company's overall business. UBS's Sheridan wrote in a recent note that Amazon is continuing to expand its marketing platform by offering more "sophisticated and targeted" advertising solutions, although its revenue is still small. "We believe the long-term potential of Amazon's advertising business is still largely overlooked despite Amazon's large reach (over 300m active customers)," Sheridan wrote. UBS   According to Bloomberg's Shira Ovide and Leila Abboud, Amazon's ad business is estimated to have generated roughly $1.2 billion in 2016. If you apply Facebook's operating margin, Amazon's ad business would have made $395 million in operating income last year, a solid 18% of Amazon's total operating income. During the earnings call, Darin Manney, Amazon's head of IR, cautioned against making a big deal out of the jump in "other" revenue, stressing that it includes revenue from its co-branded credit card arrangements and other types of advertising deals. Still, Amazon seems to be drawing a lot of attention from industry big wigs, including WPP CEO Martin Sorrell, who, according to Bloomberg, recently said: "The company that would worry me if I was a client — or I think worries our clients, more than Google and Facebook — is Amazon."

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Web apps are about to integrate a whole lot more… Web apps are about to integrate a whole lot more deeply in Android By Christian de Looper — February 2, 2017 4:15 PM Subscribe Share Malarie Gokey DigitalTrends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Web apps are about to get a lot more easy to use and interact with on Android. Web apps and Android apps are getting closer and closer in terms of user experience and on Thursday, Google announced the next stage in furthering that process. How? By integrating Progressive Web Apps more deeply into Android through App shortcuts that will show up in the phone’s app drawer. In 2015, Google first started bringing web apps to Android through a Chrome for Android update — which allowed developers to create a prompt for users to add shortcuts to web apps to the home screen. Those shortcuts, however, certainly didn’t act the same as other Android apps. With these new updates, Google is trying to remedy that. The new Chrome for Android features will be rolling out to users over the next few weeks. More: Users of iOS can now control Chromecast from their iPhone’s lock screen “In 2015, we added a new feature to Chrome for Android that allows developers to prompt users to add their site to the Home screen for fast and convenient access,” said Google in a blog post. “That feature uses an Android shortcut, which means that web apps don’t show up throughout Android in the same way as installed native apps.” Apart from appearing in the phone’s app drawer, web apps will also now be able to get incoming notifications from other apps and when you long-press one of those notifications, you will get the same notification controls that you get from normal Android apps — rather than the notification controls for Google Chrome. A new menu item will also show up for Google Chrome for Android, allowing users to more easily add web apps to the home screen. Soon, you will be able to just tap on the Chrome menu, then tap a button that says “Add to Home screen.” It will be interesting to see how web apps and Android apps merge over the next few years — and just how similar they become.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google’s latest Live Case designs inspired… Google’s latest Live Case designs inspired by a New York City Ballet performance By Julian Chokkattu — February 2, 2017 4:21 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Are you a big fan of the New York City Ballet? Google has a Live Case for your phone that you'll flip for. Google’s Live Cases allow you to add personal photos to a phone case, as well as opt for maps of your favorite locations. But the search giant also periodically partners with artists and companies to offer themed cases. The latest collaboration ties into designs worn by the New York City Ballet for “The Times are Racing.” Opening Ceremony, a New York fashion firm, is behind the costumes of the performance, and the firm has also partnered with Google to release the same designs on Live Cases. These cases are only compatible with Google’s Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P. More: Discover new recipes and fine-tune your search results via the Google app “The designs for this ballet also inspired Opening Ceremony’s Spring 2017 ready-to-wear collection,” according to the Google Live Case website. “To extend the creative collaboration, Opening Ceremony partnered with Google to bring the eight storybook prints from the runway to Live Case for a limited time.” Opening Ceremony says the designs are influenced by the following words: Defy, fight, protest, act, unite, and change. The words embody “what it means to be American. There are eight designs to choose from, but there are six more from Opening Ceremony that were added earlier. The cases are $40 and are available now for the four aforementioned smartphones. There’s also an accompanying wallpaper you can access via the Live Case app. More: Google’s two Android Wear smartwatches will launch in February Live Cases also have an NFC button on the back that you can toggle to activate a specific function — this can be set in the app, and functions can range from setting an app shortcut to toggling the flashlight.

In disclosing various risks, the company notes that the “vast majority” of Snapchat runs on Google Cloud, with a just signed $2 billion five year deal. Additionally, work to improve the app’s experience on Android is mentioned. Under the “Risk Factors” section, Snap makes no secret that the majority of users are on iOS, thus resulting in “prioritized development” over Android. While there is feature parity, performance and experience has historically lagged on Google devices. Fortunately, Snap recognizes that they “need to prioritize development of our products to operate on smartphones with Android operating systems” in order to “continue growth in user engagement.” An additional risk is Snap’s heavy reliance on Google Cloud for “the vast majority of our computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services.” On Monday, a $2 billion deal was signed that sees Snap paying $400 million a year for Google services until 2022. While beneficial for Google’s cloud ambitions, such an infrastructure could be risky, with the filing noting how a transition “to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and will cause us to incur significant time and expense.” It also note that some services provided by Google “do not have an alternative in the market.” However, the deal is nonexclusive, with the company currently negotiating with an undisclosed cloud provider for “redundant infrastructure support of our business operations.” More importantly, Snap notes that they might building their own infrastructure in the future.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | February 3, 2017 -- 00:17 GMT (16:17 PST) | Topic: Cloud Snapchat is running its business on Google Cloud and has agreed to spend $2 billion over the next five years to the search giant. The terms of Snapchat's cloud spending with Google was detailed in the company's initial public offering filing. In that Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Snapchat cited Google Cloud as a risk factor. Snapchat said "we currently run the vast majority of our computing on Google Cloud." Meanwhile, Snapchat said a move away from Google Cloud would result in "significant time and expense." Snapchat said: We have committed to spend $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years and have built our software and computer systems to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by Google, some of which do not have an alternative in the market. Given this, any significant disruption of or interference with our use of Google Cloud would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed. If our users or partners are not able to access Snapchat through Google Cloud or encounter difficulties in doing so, we may lose users, partners, or advertising revenue. The level of service provided by Google Cloud may also impact the usage of and our users', advertisers', and partners' satisfaction with Snapchat and could seriously harm our business and reputation. If Google Cloud experiences interruptions in service regularly or for a prolonged basis, or other similar issues, our business would be seriously harmed. Hosting costs will also increase as our user base and user engagement grows and may seriously harm our business if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of utilizing the services of Google or similar providers. What makes Snapchat's comments interesting is that it's among the first to be all-in with Google Cloud. Amazon Web Services regularly touts companies that have gone all-in. Snapchat said that Google could increase pricing terms, establish relationships with rivals or modify the service. Meanwhile, Snapchat noted Google and its YouTube unit are competitors in the advertising market. The Google Cloud dependency is a risk factor, but in the grand scheme of the IPO filing it's a smaller issue. Snapchat cited inexperience in the hardware market (Spectacles), maintaining daily active user growth and competition with Facebook, Google and others as risk factors. For 2016, Snapchat lost $514.6 million on revenue of $404.48 million. In 2015, Snapchat lost $372.9 million on revenue of $58.66 million.

Emily Fortuna / Twitter Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement Business is anything but usual for some of America's largest companies, as they question — or blatantly decry — President Trump's immigration ban. Google, Amazon, Starbucks, and Facebook are just a few of the big names to have stepped forward and denounce Trump's executive order, which restricts the entry of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and indefinitely bans Syrian refugees altogether. In the latest scuffle, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday his company was considering taking legal action to have Trump's executive order reversed, noting that hundreds of Apple staff had been affected by the travel ban. "More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds," Cook told the WSJ. "That's what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that." The following Fortune 500 companies have either publicly challenged or expressed concern over the order: Amazon Apple Citigroup Expedia Facebook Ford Goldman Sachs Alphabet Intel JPMorgan Chase MasterCard Microsoft Netflix Nike Procter & Gamble Salesforce Twitter, Square, Airbnb, Github, Etsy, Lyft, Uber, Tesla, and TripAdvisor have also protested the ban, as have pharmaceutical companies sych as Allergan and Perlara. Actions Speak Louder Than Words With so many firms lending their voice to the cause, it must be asked: Is each company genuinely invested in seeing the ban dissolved because of their values — or are some brands just riding the wave of a big marketing moment? The answer is multi-faceted: On one hand, any U.S. company speaking out against the president is taking a risk; on the other hand, it comes down to what actions these brands take beyond their statements. "A lot of people do approve the ban, so these companies are taking a risk just by taking a stance against it," said Margaret Wolfson, founder and creative director at River + Wolf. "But there seem to be three levels involved: The first is in making a statement that brands you as a compassionate believer in American values; the second is in employers looking out for their employees so they feel protected, and the third level — the hardest of all because of the logistics it entails — is going beyond the verbal to the visceral and investing time, energy, and money." Google, Starbucks, Lyft, and Airbnb, are among those companies putting their money where their values are, so to speak. Related: Silicon Valley Has Visceral Reaction to Trump's Ban "We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the United States," a Google spokesperson told NBC News. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." To make its views not only known, but felt, Google created a $4 million crisis fund for those affected by the ban, pledging $2 million that can be matched by up to $2 million from employees to fund organizations such as the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee. Starbucks announced it was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks operates. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment, instead referring to chairman and CEO Howard Schultz's public letter to Starbucks partners. Lyft has pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment beyond co-founder and CEO Logan Green's three tweets and Lyft's ACLU blog post. Soon after the ban was issued, Airbnb announced that it would provide free temporary housing to refugees and others impacted by the ban. "This initiative is a part of Airbnb's longstanding commitment to addressing the needs of refugees," said an Airbnb spokesperson, citing the company's past pledge to match up to $1 million donations to UNHCR. Also to be noted is Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' assertion that Amazon is prepared to support a lawsuit against Trump and his administration over the order, while Twitter's Jack Dorsey released a short film about Syrian refugee and entrepreneur Yassin Tehrou. Thinking on a Global Level Companies campaigning against the ban may not only be looking to protect American values, but their global relationships as well. "A lot of organizations that have and will come out against [Trump's ban] are global firms that need support in other parts of the world," said Ronald Hill, a professor of marketing and business law at Villanova School of Business. "I wouldn't be surprised if global firms coming out against it do business in areas such as Western Europe that have high Muslim populations. You have to think from a global and not just a local perspective." Hill anticipates that more businesses will be chiming in against the ban, particularly those that have a history of prioritizing corporate social responsibility — despite the backlash they may receive. "Some fashion companies came out in support of people with AIDS relatively early on when there was still backlash against that," said Hill. "This is a continuation of that corporate social responsibility, but it's a new, unexplored avenue." How the Work Pays Off While companies embark upon this new avenue, organizations such as the ACLU are prospering more than ever. "Historically, the ACLU doesn't get much support from companies. We're often viewed as a thorn in the government's side because we challenge them on issues," Mark Wier, chief development officer at the ACLU, told NBC News. "But we are seeing some companies create formalized gifts, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have offered to share proceeds of sales." From last Friday, when Trump issued the immigration ban, to the following Monday, Wier says that the ACLU raised a record $35 million. Related: Celebs and VIPs Donate to ACLU to Fight Trump "We've never seen that kind of outpouring so quickly," said Wier, adding that the ACLU will use the funding to hire over 100 employees including litigators, advocates, and communications specialists. "We need to power up the grid up we've already established with more force," said Wier. "Since the ACLU was able to get a stay on that executive order in federal district court, people are really seeing that it is possible to do something — and to actually win."

The search giant has updated its Google app algorithm to allow you to narrow down your search by things like ingredients, flavors, and cooking method. Now when searching for a recipe, you'll see a number of clickable options below the search bar that you can use to narrow your search down even further and get closer to the perfect dish. For instance, a search for "chicken wings" within the Google app on your phone will produce terms like "crispy," "honey," and "buffalo" below the search bar. Click one, and you'll be given even more narrowing terms, so you can pinpoint that grilled honey mustard wing recipe you're looking for. Google Trends offers a strangely illuminating glimpse into what’s on Americans’ minds — and 2016 is no exception. Here’s the map showing their results: Estately Here are some highlights of what Google users were looking into across the nation: Alabama: Harper Lee (the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “To Kill a Mockingbird” who died in 2016) Georgia: New Comey Letter (after the FBI director reopened the inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s email server) and Harriet Tubman (the anti-slavery icon chosen to adorn new $20 bills) New York: Panama Papers (the millions of leaked documents that detail financial and attorney–client information for more than 200,000 offshore entities worldwide) Missouri: McDonald’s breakfast all day (a big move announced by the fast food chain in 2016) New Mexico: Gary Johnson (the Libertarian candidate for president in 2016 who won 0 electoral votes) Vermont: Orlando Bloom naked (no explanation necessary) Media: WochIt Media The feature is a good one, but is also optional. So, if you just want to look at all the chicken wing recipe options out there and narrow down your search by what looks good, you can still do that too. The idea with this one is that when you do know exactly what you're looking for, Google can help you find it quickly. And if you're not quite sure what you're looking for, the app can offer some guidance on what's out there. For now, the feature is only available in Google's mobile app. To use it, you'll need to download the app onto your mobile phone or tablet from the App Store or Google Play.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. February Keeney (Engineering Manager, Community & Safety, GitHub) is passionate about building inclusive workplaces and online communities. Presently, she is furthering these goals in her role as the Engineering Manager for the Community & Safety team at GitHub. February can frequently be seen taking photos of sidewalks and power lines. Left unattended at conferences, she will seek out a piano and start covering pop b-sides. February lives in SF Bay Area. Kristy Tillman (Head of Communication Design, Slack). Before her role at Slack, Kristy served as the design director for Society of Grownups, a venture changing the face of financial literacy for the young adult set. There she was dedicated to crafting and inspiring the brand across both the digital and physical experiences. Previously, Kristy was a designer at IDEO, working projects ranging from brand to digital design. She is a 2013 Media Ideation Fellow, and an alumni of Florida A&M University and teaches design at General Assemb.ly. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay.

And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use. Host: Bertrand Neveux Questions: Submit questions for April during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website. Deck Host: Nick Nguyen Questions: Submit questions for Jocelyn during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #brantina December 3, 2015: Optimizing for Uncertainty with Mike Arauz, August Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, December 3 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Optimizing for Uncertainty: Deciding and Moving Quickly The web is increasingly complex and dynamic. How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement. Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News. Host: Doug Turner Deck Questions: Submit questions for Deanna during the event on IRC #AirMozilla.

Larger companies that embrace this approach (examples include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Dropbox) use creativity, analytical thinking, and social metrics to gain product exposure and grow their market share quickly. Speaker: Hiten Shah is cofounder and president of analytics companies KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg; he also advises startups. Host: Jascha Kaykas-Wolff Deck Questions: Submit your questions for Hiten in advance here, or during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. July 23, 2015: Rapid Prototyping with Tom Chi, GoogleX Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, July 23 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Tom Chi has worked in disciplines ranging from astrophysical research to Fortune 500 consulting to developing new hardware and software (web & client) products and services. He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here. May 21, 2015: Onboarding and Team Debt with Kate Heddleston Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 21 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Kate Heddleston, a software engineer in San Francisco, does a lot of speaking on the people-dimensions of software development and engineering management best practices. Her focus is on how software gets made, as well as on what it does. Topic: Kate shares her thoughts on the topic of onboarding new hires - what it takes to do that well, particularly in an engineering environment - and the 'team debt' that results when we do it poorly. Kate also shared some of the fairly immediate things individual teams can do to reduce the debt. Deck. Questions submitted to Kate in advance are here.

Turns out that they might, according to a recent tweet by 9to5Google’s Stephen Hall who revealed that Google Assistant could soon find its way to the Nexus 5X/6P. According to Hall’s tweet, it seems that the voice assistant could find its way onto Google’s Nexus handsets in the next “major” update, which is unclear as to when that might be. Hall also points out how a Googler had recently posted on Google+ that the Nexus Player will also be getting Google Assistant, so the idea of the feature arriving on Nexus handsets doesn’t really seem like that much of a stretch. Was recently told that Assistant is finally coming to Nexus 5X/6P soon with next “major” update. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) February 2, 2017 With the Pixel handsets, Google has been attempting a different strategy than the one they employed with the Nexus, where certain features, such as Google Assistant, would be exclusive to the Pixel phones. Even the Pixel’s launcher was different from the Nexus handsets, so it is clear that Google sees the Pixels as more than just a phone that runs on vanilla Android. Either way we suppose this is good news, assuming the information is accurate, but do check back with us in the coming weeks/months to see when this alleged “major” update will be arriving. In the meantime there’s an unofficial method to getting Google Assistant on your phone, with the instructions posted on XDA. Filed in Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about Google and google assistant.

Snap commits $2 billion over 5 years for Google Cloud infrastructure Posted 9 hours ago by Ryan Lawler (@ryanlawler) 0 SHARES Next Story Snap paid $114.5M to acquire Vurb and gives acquisition details for Bitstrips and Looksery Most of today’s Snap coverage will be about its revenue and daily average usage numbers, but there was one small tidbit that emerged that will mean big business for the company’s cloud infrastructure partner, Google. In Snap’s S-1 filing, the company announced a license platform agreement it struck with Google for its cloud infrastructure services. Under the terms of the deal, which was completed just a few days ago (on January 30), Snap committed to purchasing at least $400 million in cloud services for each of the next five years. Snap has been using Google infrastructure since at least 2013, but the size of the deal will likely make it one of Google’s largest and most important cloud customers. For each of the first four years, Snap will be able to roll 15 percent of that amount over to the next year, but otherwise it will be required to pay the difference if it doesn’t meet the minimum purchase agreement. All told, that means Snap will be paying Google at least $2 billion for its cloud infrastructure through 2022. Google doesn’t break out revenues from its cloud infrastructure, choosing to lump it in with other non-advertising businesses like hardware and Google Play sales. But that segment totaled $3.4 billion in sales in the most recent quarter. In that case, $400 million a year is actually a significant portion of the segment’s business. For Snap, the deal represents a huge future commitment, and is even listed as a potential risk factor if the platform is discontinued or if it changes its terms of services or policies, among other things. Relying on Google Cloud could also potentially limit Snap’s ability to expand into markets like China. As the company notes in its filing: “We also face regulatory challenges that may affect our ability to grow in certain markets. For example, we have very limited access to the China market, as we have not yet established an operating presence in China to support Snapchat. Access to Google, which currently powers our infrastructure, is restricted in China.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Snap Inc.

 Snap will pay Google at least $400 million a year for the next 5 years Matt Weinberger Feb. 2, 2017, 5:53 PM 5,136 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google cloud boss Diane GreeneGoogle Snap just filed for a $3 billion IPO, giving us a peek behind the curtain at the company that makes Snapchat. And what we've learned is that, earlier this very week, Snap entered into a $400 million-a-year deal with the Google Cloud Platform, to provide the infrastructure and services that keep the Snapchat app running. "The agreement has an initial term of five years and we are required to purchase at least $400.0 million of cloud services in each year of the agreement, though for each of the first four years, up to 15% of this amount may be moved to a subsequent year," says Snap's S-1 IPO filing. For context, Snap says it generated $404.5 million in revenue in 2016.  Google Cloud Platform is what technical types would call a "public cloud" service, where engineers like Snapchat's can pay by the minute for unlimited supercomputing services. To this day, Snapchat remains one of the largest users of Google's cloud infrastructure, although it's recently brought a data center specialist in house.  Importantly, the terms of Snap's agreement with Google allow it to use other public cloud providers, too. An example of a company that uses more than one provider is HTC, which as of mid-2o15 used Amazon Web Services for some stuff, Google Cloud Platform for a lot of its image processing, and Microsoft Azure in China, where Google doesn't do business.  At the same time, though, if Snap doesn't meet its $400 million per year spending minimums with Google, it's on the hook for the difference. It's a big deal for Google, which has been jockeying for position with the leading $10 billion Amazon Web Services cloud and the second-place Microsoft Azure. Notably, Alphabet's investment arm, Google Capital, previously made an investment in Snap. Google declined to comment.

 Snap says Apple is a competitor Kif Leswing Feb. 2, 2017, 6:12 PM 3,761 facebook linkedin twitter email print Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Time Inc Snap is a social media startup with just over 1800 employees. Apple is the world's most valuable company, with over 80,000 US workers. But Snap still sees the iPhone company as a competitor.  In an SEC filing released on Thursday, Snap mentions Apple several times as a competitor, despite the fact that Snap's revenue comes from advertising, a business that Apple almost entirely ignores. Snap also mentions Facebook, Google, and Twitter as competitors, among others. But those companies have businesses that are more closely in competition with Snap's primary product, Snapchat.  "We compete with other companies in every aspect of our business, particularly with companies that focus on mobile engagement and advertising," Snap leadership wrote in its S-1 filing. "Many of these companies, such as Apple, Facebook (including Instagram and WhatsApp), Google (including YouTube), and Twitter, have significantly greater financial and human resources and, in some cases, larger user bases." "We compete broadly with the social media offerings of Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, and with other, largely regional, social media platforms that have strong positions in particular countries," according to a risk factor listed in Snap's filing.  Snap is likely referring in the case of Apple to iMessage, a messaging platform that features stickers and animations similar to Snapchat. Apple says there are 1 billion Apple devices in use, and most of those can run iMessage.  One worry for Snap is that Apple could use its dominant position in the smartphone market to muscle Snap off of consumers' home screens. Apple has been rumored to be working on a Snapchat-like video editing product, maybe in its camera app.  From the filing:  Certain competitors, including Apple, Facebook, and Google, could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantages against us in areas where we operate, including by: • integrating competing social media platforms or features into products they control such as search engines, web browsers, or mobile device operating systems; • making acquisitions for similar or complementary products or services; or • impeding Snapchat’s accessibility and usability by modifying existing hardware and software on which the Snapchat application operates. Snap has released a hardware product, Spectacles, putting the company more closely in competition with Apple, which makes its money by selling hardware. However, Apple does not have a glasses product to compete with Spectacles, a pair of camera-equipped glasses that Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has called "a toy." In Thursday's filing, Snap admitted that the revenue from Spectacles was "not material."

Image: snap inc. By Kerry Flynn2017-02-02 23:26:14 UTC Snapchat essentially got its start by eliminating risk. Want to send a nude to a lover or a goofy face to a friend? Don't worry, it'll disappear in 10 seconds. SEE ALSO: Snapchat files for IPO as $SNAP — looks to raise $3 billion But now, as a startup that just filed to go public, the risks look pretty damn real. The word "risk" appears 87 times in Snap Inc.'s Form S-1 filed Thursday.  Here they are in summary, with our background and more plain English explanations:  1. Keeping its users happy Our ecosystem of users, advertisers, and partners depends on the engagement of our user base. We anticipate that the growth rate of our user base will decline over time. If we fail to retain current users or add new users, or if our users engage less with Snapchat, our business would be seriously harmed. Snapchat is reminding the public that one day it may not be the hottest app to the kids. In fact, we've already seen a slowdown in the app's growth. A Bloomberg report from June 2016 revealed Snapchat had 150 million daily active users. According to S-1 filing, that came more than 7 months later, Snapchat has added only 8 million daily active users.  A lot of companies look outside the U.S. to boost growth. For Snapchat, that doesn't look like the rosiest prospect. Snapchat non-U.S. and non-Europe user growth is.... pic.twitter.com/yls3GEhQLc — Jason Abbruzzese (@JasonAbbruzzese) February 2, 2017 But while its army of Snapchat users is much smaller than Facebook's at more than 1 billion daily active, Snapchat touts its engagement — 25 minutes per user.  2. Playing in Google and Apple's worlds Snapchat depends on effectively operating with mobile operating systems, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control. Changes in our products or to those operating systems, hardware, networks, regulations, or standards may seriously harm our user growth, retention, and engagement. Snapchat calls itself a camera company, but it doesn't exactly own the entire camera. It relies on Apple iOS and Google Android to host its app, the "flagship product." 3. Relying on Google for a lot We rely on Google Cloud for the vast majority of our computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of the Google Cloud operation would negatively affect our operations and seriously harm our business. If Google, one of the most valuable companies in the world, were to shutdown its storage system, Snapchat could be in trouble.  4. The fickle advertising industry  We generate substantially all our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of advertisers, or a reduction in how much they spend, could seriously harm our business. Snapchat has been clawing its way into advertisers' budgets. It faces stiff competition from Facebook and Google, who are in what amounts to a duopoly for digital ads. The two tech giants together represented 99 percent of the U.S. ad revenue growth in the last year.  updated duopoly #s. new IAB data came out yesterday. easy to run vs earnings for goog and fb, it's evident everyone else is zero sum game. pic.twitter.com/wolgdpfcxp — Jason Kint (@jason_kint) December 30, 2016 Meanwhile, each of these companies are trying to pull spending from TV budgets.  Snapchat is also admitting in its risk factor that it's not — at least not yet — pulling in a lot of revenue from products. In the end of last year, Snapchat began selling Spectacles, its video-camera sunglasses for $130 per pair.  5. The need to keep making new stuff while maintaining the old stuff If we do not develop successful new products or improve existing ones, our business will suffer. We also invest in new lines of business that could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue. Snapchat needs to keep making its stuff cool, while also making sure its existing stuff works as well. Otherwise, it won't make enough money to justify the hype. 6. A long list of powerful competitors  Our business is highly competitive. We face significant competition that we anticipate will continue to intensify. If we are not able to maintain or improve our market share, our business could suffer. It's not a one-horse race. Current competitors are formidable foes that also "focus on mobile engagement and advertising," according to the filing.  Here's Snapchat's full list of enemies: Apple Facebook, along with Instagram and WhatsApp Google, along with YouTube Twitter  Kakao LINE Naver, including Snow  Tencent  Snapchat also writes that it competes with companies in "print, radio, and television sectors to underlying technologies like default smartphone cameras and messaging." These competitors, with their wealth of resources and massive user base (for some), also have the potential to mimic Snapchat's technology. Snapchat is already all too familiar with the game.  7. Making money is... hard We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability. Snapchat has already been ridiculed for bleeding money. Its cash for 2015 was $640.8 million. In 2016, it was down to $150.1 million. The company also lost a whopping $514 million in 2016.  Snapchat just admitted it may never make money. Like ever.  Snap's losses are accelerating just as fast as its revenues pic.twitter.com/b4Bj6Dl9De — Owen ⚡️ (@ow) February 2, 2017 8. Attracting talent  The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could seriously harm our business. Silicon Valley is a land of competition. Software engineers aren't cheap, and they're always looking for the best, most fun, and perhaps more importantly, most financially lucrative jobs. One day, Snapchat might not be the hottest place to work.  9. Young and unique  We have a short operating history and a new business model, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results and increases the risk that we will not be successful. Remember Snapchat is 5 years old. There's still a chance that this whole thing just doesn't work.  Image: andrew hutchinson/snapchat  10. Getting hacked  If our security is compromised or if our platform is subjected to attacks that frustrate or thwart our users’ ability to access our products and services, our users, advertisers, and partners may cut back on or stop using our products and services altogether, which could seriously harm our business. Snapchat has been through quite a few user privacy scares. A hack in January 2014 leaked the usernames and phone number of 4.6 million users.  Snapchat has since added two-factor authentication for users and worked to eliminate third-party apps from being used to scrap data.  But that doesn't eliminate the risk of being hacked again, especially when you rely on third-parties, like Google Cloud, to store your information.  11. Math is hard  Our user metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics may seriously harm and negatively affect our reputation and our business. Snapchat relies on a lot of third-party companies and internal software to track its engagement. As Facebook has been shamed, publishers and advertisers rely on these metrics to do business. When you lose the publishers' trust, you lose their attention.  12. Complicated stock stuff  We are not aware of any other company that has completed an initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock exchange. We therefore cannot predict the impact our capital structure and the concentrated control by our founders may have on our stock price or our business.   People who purchase Snap stock will have no voting rights. That means the board at Snap, led by cofounders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, will be able to make all of the decisions. As Snap notes, that type of distribution of power — or lack of thereof — is not popular in the U.S. market so it's very much tbd on what will happen.  meanwhile this is a risk factor: "Our two co-founders have control over all stockholder decisions" — Erin Griffith (@eringriffith) February 2, 2017 But, in its carefully phrased S-1, Snap Inc. asserts that risk may also be its greatest strength: "In the way that the flashing cursor became the starting point for most products on desktop computers, we believe that the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones.  This is because images created by smartphone cameras contain more context and richer information than other forms of input like text entered on a keyboard. This means that we are willing to take risks in an attempt to create innovative and different camera products that are better able to reflect and improve our life experiences. For potential stockholders, buying Snap is a bet on the future cards dealt by the two cofounders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy. Some, like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, have earned that confidence.   Be careful, Snapchat.  BONUS: Google Glass gives the Snapchat Spectacles the reality check it needs Topics: Business, Facebook, Media, snap inc, snap ipo, snapchat ipo About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

The company filed with an initial size of US$3 billion (S$4.23 billion), a placeholder amount used to calculate fees that may change. Snap plans to raise as much as US$4 billion in the IPO, people familiar with the matter have said, for a market value of as much as US$25 billion. Based on that valuation, co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, who each hold 20 per cent of Snap, would each own shares worth about US$5 billion. Venture capital firm Benchmark is the biggest outside investor, with a 12 per cent stake worth an estimated US$3 billion. Lightspeed Venture Partners owns 7.7 per cent worth about US$1.9 billion. Snap plans to use proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, the filing shows.   40566447_-_16_11_2016_-_snapchat-ipo_.jpg Related Story Photo-sharing app Snapchat: From class project beginnings to IPO value of US$20 billion In filing for an IPO, the veil was lifted on how much money Snap is losing. It posted a net loss of US$515 million last year, according to the company's IPO prospectus, shelling out cash to infrastructure providers including Alphabet's Google and for research and development. That compares with a loss of US$382 million the previous year. Revenue for 2016 was $404 million. As a private company, Snap has benefited from a funding environment that valued growth over profitability. A chart showing increasing revenue or engagement meant easy access to capital. But large losses may ring warning bells for investors who have been burned by past bets on unprofitable companies that went public. The filing depicts a budding and inventive company, aiming to build a booming advertising business around young people, an elusive set of smartphone addicts, deeply engaged in its product. It also warns of mounting challenges to further growth: stiff competition, slowing user growth, and mounting losses that may remind investors of once-ascendant, now-struggling companies such as Twitter. "We have a short operating history and a new business model, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results," Snap said in the Thursday filing. That "increases the risk that we will not be successful." The company's strategy in the face of those circumstances "is to focus on innovation and take risks to improve our products." In the meantime, Snap is focusing investors' attention on its track record for developing catchy products. Through coluorful graphics in the IPO prospectus, the company highlights its daily active user count of more than 150 million as well as ad-attracting offerings including Lenses and Geofilters. Snap cites engagement as key to future success, at the same time admitting that metrics to measure the company's reach - such as daily active users - have been and will continue to be "lumpy and unpredictable." Quarterly average revenue per user on a global basis, a key metric showing how the company makes money from user engagement, climbed to US$1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2016 from 31 cents in the year-earlier period. How much risk investors are willing to stomach could be affected by a unique feature of Snap's IPO - it could be the only listing of non-voting stock on a US exchange, according to the prospectus. That means the glory, or the blame, will be at the feet of founders Evan Spiegel, the chief executive officer, and Bobby Murphy, the technology chief, who have control over shareholder votes and strategic vision. The public life of Twitter, the last US social-media company to go public in 2013, will cast a shadow on Snap's debut. Twitter's IPO prospectus disclosed widening quarterly losses, and the micro-blogging site didn't grow fast enough to address the problem. Three years later, it's still not profitable. Privately, Snap's management has likened the business model more to Amazon. In a move straight out of Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos's playbook, Snap wants to shift investors' focus to the company's long-term vision. Bezos has invested heavily to enter new markets, at times alarming investors with extensive spending to that end. While some gambits have been successful and others duds, it's worked out favorably for investors who've stuck around for the long haul: Shares are up almost 43,000 per cent since the company went public in 1997, and 2,100 per cent in the past 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that accounts for stock splits. Spiegel has fewer successes to point to when asking investors to buy into his long-term plans, and a different set of challenges. Unlike Amazon, Snap relies on another company's infrastructure. Google provides most of its computing, storage and bandwidth, and any disruptions to Google's cloud functioning could "seriously" hurt its business. Snap said it plans to spend US$2 billion with Alphabet over the next five years to use Google's cloud-computing services. In terms of competition, the barrier to entry for social media and communications is lower than Amazon's e-commerce business or cloud-computing services. In addition to Google and Apple, Snap named Facebook, including its WhatsApp and Instagram applications, and Twitter as significant rivals. The IPO prospectus is the first opportunity for outsiders to get a closer look into a company that's known for, among other things, its culture of secrecy. The next step will be the roadshow, in which Spiegel and his management team will endeavor to explain the company's strategy and prospects to potential investors.

Beware of Fraudsters Print Email By Richard Adhikari Feb 2, 2017 2:53 PM PT A Google search for a Facebook customer support phone number may direct users to a number set up by fraudsters, according to NPR. The fraudulent number, 844-735-4595, appeared not only as top result in a Google search, but also as a featured snippet -- meaning Google highlighted it in a box at the top of its search results, NPR reported. NPR engaged phone fraud specialist Pindrop to investigate. A Pindrop researcher called the number, posing as a Facebook customer who had been locked out of his account. He was instructed to purchase an iTunes card from Walmart or Target, and then to call the number again and hand over the card number and security code. He then would receive a password to unlock his account. This is a variation on a well-known scam. In another common scenario, callers are told they have unpaid taxes, and they're directed to buy a prepaid credit card and then provide its number to settle their bill. The United States Federal Trade Commission issued an alert about the iTunes card scam this spring. Apple also issued an alert. "These types of scams target a broad range of brands to try to trick people who are looking for help with the service they use," said Facebook spokesperson Jay Nancarrow. "We have been investigating the group ... associated with this particular phone number for some time. They are prolific and are targeting many other platforms beyond Facebook," he told CRM Buyer. "People's trust level for social media is pretty low to begin with," said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "This just further degrades that trust," he told CRM Buyer. "Facebook needs to get a handle on it." Facebook's Plodding Pursuit The term "Facebook customer service" is used in searches 27,000 times a month on average, NPR said, citing Google data. Fraudulent numbers have been circulating on Facebook pages users have uncovered while searching for a customer service phone number for at least a year, NPR alleged. That raises the question of why Facebook is taking so long to deal with the problem. "We have taken down a large number of the sites offering fake support numbers, and we will continue to do so," Nancarrow said. "We also enforce against domain name registrants, registrants and registries that are enabling these scams, and continue to take down large numbers of domain names connected to them." Con artists "move around and may change their service in order to avoid being apprehended," noted Michael Patterson, CEO of Plixer. "Facebook has numerous mechanisms to [warn members] and has used them in the past," said James Pleger, director of security/threat research at RiskIQ. Still, "a more visible and transparent system may help alleviate concerns from users as well," he told CRM Buyer, adding that Facebook "take their users' security seriously." Google's Responsibility Google has "taken the appropriate action to remove the offending pages," a Google spokesperson said in a statement provided to CRM Buyer by company rep Susan Cadrecha. "We have investigated this particular issue and found that these pages have violated webmaster guidelines." A formal reporting process that would let search engines react to reliable information should be in place, Plixer's Patterson told CRM Buyer. However, "should Google be responsible for every scam like this in the entire world?" he asked. How to Protect Oneself As one rule of thumb, "if someone wants you to buy something to get customer support, then it's a scam," Frost's Jude noted. If calling a support number leads to instructions to purchase an iTunes card, said Patterson, "lift an eyebrow and start thinking twice. Then get online and search about your problem. Someone has probably run into it before and can help you." Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. February Keeney (Engineering Manager, Community & Safety, GitHub) is passionate about building inclusive workplaces and online communities. Presently, she is furthering these goals in her role as the Engineering Manager for the Community & Safety team at GitHub. February can frequently be seen taking photos of sidewalks and power lines. Left unattended at conferences, she will seek out a piano and start covering pop b-sides. February lives in SF Bay Area. Kristy Tillman (Head of Communication Design, Slack). Before her role at Slack, Kristy served as the design director for Society of Grownups, a venture changing the face of financial literacy for the young adult set. There she was dedicated to crafting and inspiring the brand across both the digital and physical experiences. Previously, Kristy was a designer at IDEO, working projects ranging from brand to digital design. She is a 2013 Media Ideation Fellow, and an alumni of Florida A&M University and teaches design at General Assemb.ly. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Hashtag: #mozSS July 20, 2016: The Invention Cycle with Tina Seelig, Stanford University Location: Mozilla MV + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, July 20 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Invention Cycle: Going From Inspiration to Implementation Are you stuck on where to go with your product and need an infusion of creativity? Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Hashtag: #mozSS Deck materials also in this post May 26, 2016: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years with Kevin Kelly, Wired Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 26 @ Mozilla SF - 10:30am PT / 1:30pm ET / 6:30pm UTC Topic: Twelve Technology Forces Shaping the Next 30 Years Much of what will happen in the next thirty years is inevitable, driven by technological trends already in motion. Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Hashtag: #mozSS #theinevitable April 27, 2016: When Change is the Only Constant, with Kirsten Wolberg, PayPal Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, April 27 @ Mozilla SF - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: When Change is the Only Constant, Org Structure Doesn’t Matter While it may be true in tech that “change is the only constant,” some changes are bigger than others. Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services. Kirsten holds a BS degree in Finance from USC and an MBA from J.L. Kellogg School of Management. Host: David Slater Questions: Submit questions for Kirsten during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe. And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use.

Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement. Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News. Host: Doug Turner Deck Questions: Submit questions for Deanna during the event on IRC #AirMozilla.

Larger companies that embrace this approach (examples include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Dropbox) use creativity, analytical thinking, and social metrics to gain product exposure and grow their market share quickly. Speaker: Hiten Shah is cofounder and president of analytics companies KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg; he also advises startups.

July 23, 2015: Rapid Prototyping with Tom Chi, GoogleX Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, July 23 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Tom Chi has worked in disciplines ranging from astrophysical research to Fortune 500 consulting to developing new hardware and software (web & client) products and services. He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here.

Her focus is on how software gets made, as well as on what it does. Topic: Kate shares her thoughts on the topic of onboarding new hires - what it takes to do that well, particularly in an engineering environment - and the 'team debt' that results when we do it poorly. Kate also shared some of the fairly immediate things individual teams can do to reduce the debt. Deck. Questions submitted to Kate in advance are here.

Google has always been good at surfacing the best recipes, but now it will help you narrow down the options before you burrow too deep down a particular rabbithole. Even if you’re not cooking rabbit. The web is a wonderful resource most of us take for granted. I’m old enough to remember a time when you had to work hard to find the answer to simple questions. Finding out which movies an actor had been in, or what the population of New York was would require some serious research. Now, you just type something into Google and get the answer delivered within seconds How Do Search Engines Work? How Do Search Engines Work? To many people, Google IS the internet. It's arguably the most important invention since the Internet itself. And while search engines have changed a lot since, the underlying principles are still the same. Read More . When it comes to helping you find recipes, Google has taken giant leaps forward in recent years. And with its latest update to the Google app, it should be easier than ever to find the right recipe for the dish you’re looking to make. Whether it’s a lasagne or a curry. Narrowing Down the Options The key to this new approach is narrowing down the various options. This includes the ingredients, the variety of dish, the flavors, and even the cooking method. Each of which will be presented in the form of a “carousel of tappable suggestions”. As an example, if you search for chicken wings you’ll then be asked to select from “honey,” “buffalo,” “sweet,” or “sticky” to name just a few. Once you click on “honey,” you’ll be asked to select from “honey,” “honey mustard,” or “honey garlic” to name just a few. The recipes being surfaced will change as you narrow the field of your search. Narrowing the field of your search in this way ensures Google can deliver the most relevant recipes for your specific needs.

Trashing Your Old Cookbooks It’s probably no coincidence that Google has released this update just in time for Super Bowl LI on Sunday.

Thankfully, this feature isn’t going to suddenly disappear, so you can still throw all of your old cookbooks in the trash. Do you use Google to find recipes? Have you had good experiences doing so?

Barry Schwartz on February 2, 2017 at 3:42 pm More Google seems to be testing a new box in the local knowledge box panel that allows Google My Business owners to post deals and promotions below their core listing. This was spotted by Mike Blumenthal and you can see it yourself for a search on [theme park collection orlando fl]. Here is a screen shot that shows “latest from the owner” followed by a message about saving 10 percent, then with a “learn more” button that takes the searcher to driving directions on Google Maps.

James Munson Thursday, February 2nd, 2017 Federal Facebook Twitter Canadian efforts to defend trade as the U.S. takes a strong protectionist turn would be damaged if taxes on foreign internet companies were raised as a means to help Canadian media, said Google Inc. “Maybe there’s an appetite to go ‘buy Canadian’,” Jason Kee, counsel on public policy and government relations for Google in Canada, said Thursday. “Taking off my Google hat, I’m not necessarily sure that’s where we want to go in light of the fact that we seem to want to distinguish ourselves from what we’re seeing in the United States.” Kee was speaking in response to a Public Policy Forum report that recommends foreign internet advertisers like Google pay a 10 per cent tax to help pay for a national journalism fund. He was speaking on an panel hosted by iPolitics Live which was sponsored in part by Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which lobbies to increase the market clout of domestic media firms. Kee said the internet advertising market — where Google is the biggest player — is too complex to allow for taxes based on a website’s nationality, and that rules based on nationality may run afoul of trade treaties. In digital advertising, the vast majority of advertisers don’t sell ads directly to website publishers, but to ad networks that have thousands of publishers in their portfolios, Kee said. In the milliseconds that pass when a website is loading, those ad networks are often bidding for the ad space on that website. When these ad networks bid, they want to know if the audience on the other end is the audience their customers want, not whether the website is in a specific country, said Kee. “They want to know if the audience, the person seeing the ad, is Canadian, not whether the site it’s being rendered on is Canadian,” said Kee. “There’s certainly lots of information that we know about the content of the site, but not necessarily its nationality. So we wouldn’t be in a position to be able to certify that, and then the question is would that be sufficient to satisfy the (Canada Revenue Agency). So it’s a technical thing. “There is no connection between the content and the advertising necessarily. And I think that would present a significant challenge under international trade rules.” The Public Policy Forum report Shattered Mirror, released January 26, recommends amending Section 19 and 19.1 of the Income Tax Act so that tax rules in digital advertising operate similarly to advertising in print and broadcasting. Originally, Section 19 offered Canadian advertisers a tax deduction if they bought an ad with a Canadian broadcaster or newspaper. It was introduced in 1965 to deal with advertisers who were placing ads with more lucrative U.S. media companies that reached Canadian audiences, such as American television stations near the border. The deduction should come to cover the digital advertising as well, the report recommends. Today, a Canadian advertiser cannot deduct expenses for taking space in The New York Times — but can when placing an ad on nyt.com, it says. But because Section 19 was written in the era before NAFTA, a clause for internet companies should function in the form of a 10 per cent withholding tax on the advertising expenditures that do not qualify as Canadian-owned, the report says. A company would qualify as Canadian if it was subject to Canadian consumption and corporate income taxes, if it was located in Canada and if it met “minimum thresholds for producing original civic-function journalism aimed primarily at Canadian audiences,” it says. The revenue from the tax — which the report estimates would be between $300 to $400 million a year — should be used for a special ‘Future of Journalism and Democracy Fund’ to support civic-minded reporting. The digital advertising market is “very challenging as a model when you compare it to the model that Section 19 was actually developed for,” said Kee. “There’s plenty of other companies that basically all do this. And it would be very challenging for them to re-architect their entire system to accommodate.” Public Policy Forum President and CEO Edward Greenspon, another panelist at Thursday’s talk, pointed out that some ad networks only serve Canadian websites. The forum’s report found that Google and Facebook received 90 per cent of digital ad growth in the U.S. over a year-to-year quarterly analysis. Google and Facebook pocket two of every three dollars spent on digital ads in Canada, it says. Still, major Canadian publishers use advertising services offered by U.S. companies, said Kee. When publishers use Google ad display services, 70 per cent of the revenue from those ads go back to the website where the ad is placed, he said. “It’s important to bear in mind that it’s a very evolved ecosystem that actually benefits the Canadian publishers because they’re actually participants in this ecosystem and actually see revenues from it,” he said.

Google Cloud takes aim at Microsoft customers with new Windows VMs Posted yesterday by Ron Miller (@ron_miller) 0 SHARES Next Story iPhone 7 sales helped Apple reclaim the top spot in the global smartphone market Google announced several new products today aimed at luring IT pros who are using Windows in their data centers to the Google Cloud Platform. With that in mind, Google introduced support for Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise and Windows Server Core on the Cloud Platform. In addition, the company announced support for SQL Server Always-On Availability Group for customers who are concerned about high availability and disaster recovery when running critical operations in a cloud setting. What this means in practical terms is that IT pros can now launch pre-configured virtual machines running any of these products on Google Cloud Platform, and pay for them by the minute — or they can bring an existing SQL Server license they have already paid for. Chris Sells, lead product manager for Google Cloud Developer Tools says this is part of a broader strategy to support Windows products on GCP. First of all, he says, it shows Google’s ready to take on enterprise customers running these Windows products. Secondly, it’s part of a bigger effort that began last year when Google began supporting other Windows products such SQL Server 2008 and 2012. Today’s announcement is just an extension of that. Perhaps more importantly, it also provides an alternative for companies that don’t want to necessarily be tied to Microsoft but still need to run Microsoft products. “Microsoft provides these capabilities and they own Windows and SQL Server, but we are finding that lots of customers are looking for alternatives to Microsoft,” notes Sells. By providing these kinds of products, GCP is hoping to lure these people to their platform. Related Articles Windows Server On Google Compute Engine Hits General Availability Diane Greene wants to put the enterprise front and center of Google Cloud strategy Google combines all of its cloud services under the 'Google Cloud' brand It’s part of a bigger story that began when Diane Greene came on board to run Google Cloud at the end of 2015. Greene brought with her years of enterprise experience, including her stint as co-founder and CEO at VMware. As Greene told TechCrunch last spring, the enterprise is “becoming a super interesting place” and she clearly wants to lead Google Cloud Platform to get a piece of that action. Sells says they see this announcement as part of bringing Greene’s enterprise vision to fruition, and while it’s only a small piece of that overall enterprise push, it is part of a deliberate effort to capture more traditional enterprise marketshare and move it to Google’s cloud. “We want to make sure we have a great place to put their data. If it’s in SQL Server and they want to keep it there, we support them,” he says. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Cloud Platform Founded 2012 Overview Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test and deploy applications on Google’s highly-scalable and reliable infrastructure.

The iPhone maker's brand value has plummeted 27 percent to $107 billion since the start of last year, according to Brand Finance's Global 500 2017 report. Google's brand, however, is now worth $109 billion, making it the most lucrative in the world. It is the first time the search giant has topped the list since 2011.

The company posted revenue of $26 billion during that three month period. And it reported net income of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share.

Google will soon integrate Progressive Web Apps deeper into Android Posted 12 hours ago by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story AWS still owns the cloud Progressive Web Apps, which are basically sophisticated web apps that are able to use features like push notifications and a local cache to give users a native-like experience, have been on Google’s radar for the last few years. While they almost look and feel like native apps, they were never fully integrated into Android. Google plans to change this soon, though. Soon, you will not just be able to add a link to a progressive web app to your home screen, but once you save it there, that app will also be integrated far deeper into Android than ever before. The apps will not just appear on the home screen, for example, but also in the app drawer. They will also appear in the settings menu, get all the same notifications options that native apps currently have, and be able to receive incoming intents from other apps. “This new Add to Home screen feature is one more step in our journey to empower developers to build the best possible experience for their users, and we are committed to ensuring the same mechanisms for installing Progressive Web Apps are available to all browsers on Android,” Google’s Yaron Friedman writes in today’s announcement. For users, this will make for a far better experience than the current one, which mostly treats the links to the web apps as glorified bookmarks. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Android Description Android is a software platform for mobile devices based on the Linux operating system and developed by Google and the Open Handset Website http://code.google.com/android Full profile for Android Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

It’s the best way to keep track of your daily schedule and to make sure you don’t forget about anything in the future. Google Calendar is arguably the biggest advancement in calendars since they started printing them out with cat photos. To get the most out of this powerful productivity tool, there are a few tips and tricks you should know about. Read this list now or add it to your calendar for later. Read also: Google Maps Tips, Gmail Tips, Inbox Tips Set up Quick Responses to save time One of the biggest benefits of using Google Calendar is the seamless integration with other Google apps. Gmail and Calendar are a match made in heaven. You can use Calendar to send emails to everyone that’s attending an event. That’s pretty handy already, but you can save even more time by using the Quick Responses. Open Calendar In the menu, tap Settings > General Select Quick responses Touch one of the current responses to edit or replace the text Tap OK To use the quick responses: Open Calendar Choose an event Select Email guests Choose one of your quick responses, or write a new message Let Google fill in your event details One of the most important things to do with Google Calendar is to make your events as details as possible. The more information you put into an event, the smarter Calendar will be. For example, putting exact locations for events will give you estimated travel times. The Event creation screen has a ton of options, but you can actually fill in most of it just by using the text entry field at the top. Open Calendar Tap the (+) button Choose event Tap the text entry field at the top Basically, just start typing. Google will pick out certain details as you type. If you type “Football game at Ford Field” you’ll see location suggestions pop up. Tap the one you want and then keep typing. The next logical thing to type would be “with [friend name]” and select the suggested contact. Finish it off by typing the date and time with “on November 15” and select the suggestion again. Tap DONE. Everything will be filled in for you. Give your events automatic alarms When you’re creating an event you have the ability to add an alarm. This will notify you when the event is approaching. It can be tedious to customize the alarm time for every event. The easier way is to choose a default time that will work for most events. You can still customize it for specific events if you feel the need. Open Calendar In the menu, tap Settings > Events (for one of your Google accounts) Adjust the Default notifications You can add multiple notifications for events Select a default duration for all events Like the aforementioned alarms, you can choose a duration time when creating an event. If all of your events are basically the same length, or it doesn’t matter much, you can create a default duration. Once again, this can be customized for specific events. Open Calendar In the menu, tap Settings > General Select Default even duration Choose one of the duration options Keep up with your goals in Calendar Did you know Google Calendar can help you achieve goals? This is a new feature that makes it super easy to stick with something, like an exercise routine. Google will automatically create “sessions” and add them to your Calendar. You simply pick a goal and tell Google how often you want to work at it. Open Calendar In the bottom right tap (+) Tap Goal Choose a category Pick one of the suggestions or tap Custom Follow the directions to set up your goal Tap Done Sessions will be automatically added to your calendar, starting with the first four weeks. You can adjust the time or length of these events by going back into the goal settings. Create Reminders in Calendar Google has several ways to make Reminders and Calendar is one of them. Sometimes you don’t need to create a full-fledged event for something. A one-time reminder can do the job. Reminders appear on your calendar along with your events. It’s a great way to visually see when you need to do things. Open Calendar In the bottom corner tap (+) Tap Reminder Type your reminder or choose a suggestion Tap Done Choose a date, time, and frequency Tap Save Give everything a unique color A crowded calendar can be extremely difficult to read. Giving everything (and everyone) a special color can bring some organization to the chaos. Google Calendar allows you to color code calendars and events. EVen if you only use two calendars, this is a must. Choose colors for calendars Open Calendar In the menu, tap Settings Select one of your calendars Tap Color and choose a color Choose colors for individual events Choose an existing event or create a new one (+) Tap the Pencil icon to edit Tap the color and change it Start your week whenever you want Back in the day when we used physical calendars, the week was always shown as starting on Sunday. That philosophy has transitioned to digital calendars, but it might not make much sense to most people. If you work Monday to Friday, the week starts on Monday. The weekend is literally the end of the week. Or maybe it’s the start of the week? Google lets you decide. Open Calendar In the menu, tap Settings > General Tap Start of the week Select one of the days Swipe to remove reminders and events A lot of people use the calendar as a to-do list for the day. It’s a nice way to see everything you have to do. So why not treat it like a to-do list and check things off when they’re done? Google Calendar allows you to swipe events and reminders away when they have been completed. Open Calendar Be in the Schedule view Swipe from left-to-right on an event Use the awesome Calendar widget Remember widgets? Some people do, but a lot of Android users have forgotten about this core feature. The Google Calendar app might have the best widget you can use. It comes in two varieties: month and schedule. If you find yourself opening the calendar app a lot, you should give the widgets a try.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today said it is cancelling its Hands Free mobile payment service. The company has been piloting Hands Free Payments since March 2016. Hands Free allowed people to pay for goods and services without taking their phone out of their pocket. It relied on location data, WiFi, Bluetooth beacons, and other sensors to detect nearby participating stores. Pilot testers needed only to say "I'll pay with Google" to the cashier, who confirmed shoppers' identity with their initials and profile photo. Google said it has learned a lot from early adopters. "Based on all the positive feedback, we're now working to bring the best of the Hands Free technology to even more people and stores. To focus our efforts on that, we'll be shutting down the Hands Free app on February 8," said the company. Google suggests people interested in mobile payments take a look at Android Pay, which is available to most NFC-equipped Android smartphones. more info at Google » Related Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Tucked away under the Wi-Fi settings, iOS now warns users when connecting to insecure networks that it exposes a user’s network traffic. The easy answer to this is to simply not connect to public wireless networks, but that’s something that most people will just ignore. If users won’t stop connecting to insecure public networks, they could at least start using VPNs and Apple could make it easy to do that. Virtual Private Network, or VPN for short, isn’t a new technology but it has been coming up more and more in security conversations lately. Using a VPN on a public wireless network allows the user to hide their network activity from prying eyes. Regardless if you have something to hide or not, having your banking and social media information open for all to see is just bad security practice. While it’s recommended to use one whenever possible, the trouble with VPNs starts almost as soon as one decides to use it. How does one even begin to find a recommended VPN option? On Android, Google has more or less solved this with the introduction of Wi-Fi Assistant last year. Android users are offered the ability to use Google’s free VPN service when connecting to public hotspot networks to help secure their connection. For most, this will be a good enough solution that provides them with that additional bit of security needed. On iOS, users are left to hunt from a list of hundreds of options from the App Store, sift through all the different services’ pricing options, and then take their pick. These are key areas that Apple can help customers. Google’s Wi-Fi Assistant Having already started the push towards better customer security and privacy with differential privacy, Apple providing their own VPN service for iOS users isn’t that far-fetched. With data centers spanning all over the globe and already providing free (although arguably low) iCloud storage, Apple could enable a simple VPN as another one of their services. Then instead of just letting users know they are connected to an insecure wireless network, Apple could also offer the option to use their VPN service while on public hotspot networks. If Apple doesn’t want to get into building out another service into their product line, they could at least look into simplifying the App Store experience. With hundreds of apps in the App Store all pushing various VPN services, Apple could help to highlight a few trusted companies. This wouldn’t be dissimilar to how they showcased alternative mapping applications when they made the transition from Google Maps to Apple Maps. Creating a trusted VPN category could easily alleviate some of the VPN choice confusion. With the proliferation of VPN services for customers to pick from and the rising amount of public networks, Apple has an opportunity to move their security and privacy stance forward while protecting their customers by implementing either or both of these features.

Home News Business Google overtakes Apple as the world’s most... | 12 hours ago  |  Vote 0    0 Google overtakes Apple as the world’s most valuable brand Waterloo Region Record By Charisse Jones Apple, the most valuable brand in the world for the past five years, has yielded the top spot to Google, according to a new report from Brand Finance. The iPhone maker's brand value has plummeted 27 per cent to $107 billion (all figures US) since the start of last year, according to Brand Finance's Global 500 2017 report. Google's brand, however, is now worth $109 billion, making it the most lucrative in the world. It is the first time the search giant has topped the list since 2011. Google's place as the dominant search engine safeguards its stream of advertising revenue, which increased 20 per cent last year. The uptick occurred even though marketers are paying less for each "click" of the keys by those searching online. Apple meanwhile, is losing its grip on consumers. The Apple Watch has not been the money-maker the company had hoped for. A company that was once renowned for its innovation is not signalling that it has another unique product coming any time soon. And Apple's list of competitors in the smartphone space is continuing to grow, the report says. Still, Apple is the second-most valuable global brand, followed by Amazon, AT&T and Microsoft. And this week, Apple showed that its signature iPhone still has the potential to be a profit machine, buoying investors. Robust sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus over the holidays led to the tech giant posting first-quarter earnings of $3.36 per share, and record-setting revenue of $78.4 billion, a three per cent uptick that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Apple shipped 78.3 million iPhones during the three month period. Analysts had predicted earnings of $3.22 per share based on $77.3 billion in sales. The increase followed three consecutive quarters in which iPhone shipments dipped, and the first fiscal year in over a decade that Apple experienced a drop in sales. Meanwhile, Google's parent company Alphabet reported this month that its fourth quarter revenue soared 22 per cent, largely propelled by mobile search, video ads, and its expansion in newer business lines like cloud computing. The company posted revenue of $26 billion during that three month period. And it reported net income of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share. While technology was dominant among the world's most valuable companies, the banking industry was next in having the most lucrative brands, followed by the telecom sector, retail and the car industry. Brand Finance said RBC is the most valuable Canadian brand, ranking 106th. Among Canadian brands, it is followed by TD (107), Bell (144), Scotiabank (166), Bank of Montreal (188), Tim Hortons (192) and Rogers (218).

However, a recent bug keeps automatically disabling the ‘Trusted voice’ option, thus making “Ok Google” slightly less convenient. Fortunately, a fix has now been identified and is rolling out soon. Trusted voice allows the “Ok Google” hotword to act as a password to unlock your device. It works by seeing if the uttered phrase at the start of a command matches your previously trained voice model. This is particularly useful when asking Google to perform a voice command that has a visual element, like surfacing images or getting directions. In the past few months, several users on multiple devices have reported that the Trusted voice toggle located in settings of the Google app keeps turning off automatically. Even after re-enabling, the toggle would later be disabled. As such, getting the result of a voice command would require that users first enter a password. Fortunately, a Google employee in the Pixel User Community notes that “the team has identified a fix, and it will be implemented soon.”Anecdotally, I have found that with the latest Google app beta (version 6.12), the Trusted voice toggle always stays enabled. In the mean time, the following workaround should work until the patch is rolled out: Go to Google app -> setting -> Accounts & privacy -> Google activity controls -> Voice & Audio Activity -> make sure it’s set to “on” Ensure this setting is “on” for all accounts on the device Guides ok google View THe Guide Smart Lock View THe Guide Trusted voice View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

In an update today, Google has reworked the app’s “albums” tab to make it easier to explore all of the photos on your device. The tab is now split into three sections: one allows you to explore your camera roll in different ways (sorting places by location or people, for instance), another section will let you dive into photos taken inside of other apps, and the third section shows your actual photo albums. “Albums” is almost a misnomer now The complexity almost makes “albums” a misnomer for this tab, but it’s definitely a helpful change. For one, getting to photos stored in other apps used to require diving into a menu, so this saves a step. And while those other two sections (your albums and exploration options) were already inside the albums tab before this update, they’re now presented in ways that are a bit easier to view. Instead of being represented by full-width photos, albums are now shown as squares, which lets you see twice as many at once. The exploration section is much more noticeable, too. Before, it was a narrow, ignorable bar at the top of the screen. Now it’s displayed more prominently, and example photos are shown in a grid to illustrate what you’ll find after tapping in. You can see a comparison below. The old version is on the left, the new version on the right.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Search updates recipe results just in time for the Super Bowl Eric Abent - Feb 2, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has updated Search through the Google app once more, and this time it’s done so in preparation for the number of searches incoming on Super Bowl Sunday. This new update is centered around helping you uncover the right dish in a sea of recipes, along with discovering new ones to try in the process. Starting today, searching for a recipe will bring up a new carousel at the top of the search. This carousel features a number of different variants of the dish you’re trying to make, which helps you narrow down your search. Google gives the example of searching for “seven layer bean dip.” Some of the options you’ll see in the carousel can include “healthy” and “vegan.” However, the carousel doesn’t just present different types, but also different preparations. For instance, when you search for chicken wings, you’ll see options for buffalo, honey, or fried wings. Click one of those options to narrow down your search and only see results for what you selected. It’s not the biggest update by any means, but take it from someone who doesn’t have much in the way of innate cooking ability: this is going to help a lot. Instead of spending extra time trying to find a recipe for the exact variation of what I want to cook, I can simply select an option from this carousel to find what I need faster. If you’re anything like me and you visit Google a lot to find new recipes, you’ll likely be just as excited to hear this news. This new feature is rolling out to the Google app today, and even though it’s arriving in time to give you new ideas for your Super Bowl party, it should hang around long after the game has been decided. It should be noted that this feature isn’t available on web browsers yet, so if you want to try it for yourself, you’ll need to use your mobile device.

Users enrolled in Google’s Android Beta Program are now able to preview a number of Nougat bug fixes, optimizations, as well as a few other enhancements. “Android 7.1.2 is an incremental maintenance release focused on refinements, so it includes a number of bugfixes and optimizations, along with a small number of enhancements for carriers and users,” writes Google in a post about the update. The new ‘swipe for notifications’ feature allows users to swipe across the fingerprint sensor to bring up app alerts, rather than needing to do so on the device’s screen. Also included in the update are redesigned app shortcuts and improved image keyboard support, among other changes. The beta is available to Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, Nexus Player and Pixel C users and requires 827.9MB download. Google says a build of the update for the Nexus 6P is coming “soon.” Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Reddit Featured Articles Snap officially files for $3 billion IPO ZeniMax wins Oculus lawsuit and is awarded half a billion dollar judgment Telus pushes back CDMA network shutdown to May 31st, 2017 Kickstarter opening Canadian office following recent acquisition of Huzza ‘I’m a Mac’ actor Justin Long is now promoting Huawei’s Android phones Sign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inbox Thank you for your subscription Related Articles News Feb 2, 2017 9:01 PM ESTOntario improves electric vehicle affordability with rebate boosts News Feb 2, 2017 7:48 PM ESTMore Canadians use phablets than medium-sized phones, according to report News Feb 2, 2017 6:45 PM ESTGrand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two buys mobile game dev Social Point for $250 million News Feb 2, 2017 5:35 PM ESTSnap officially files for $3 billion IPO Business Feb 2, 2017 5:25 PM ESTAmazon Q4 2016 Earnings: Sales beat analyst estimates but revenue lower year over year News Feb 2, 2017 4:54 PM ESTPokémon Go has grossed $1 billion in revenue since launch News Feb 2, 2017 4:51 PM ESTFire Emblem Heroes is now available in Canada for iOS and Android News Feb 2, 2017 4:21 PM ESTLeaked LG G6 image shows back with dual-camera and fingerprint sensor Comments Pingback: Android Nougat 7.1.2 public beta now available for Pixel and Nexus devices | Daily Update() Pingback: Android Nougat 7.1.2 public beta now available for Pixel and Nexus devices | Mo.bi - Leading Brand In Mobile Business() Categories News Reviews Features Resources Business Syrup Community Contact us About Us / Tips Contests Social Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Google+ Reddit Newsletter Signup Thank you for your subscription © 2017 mobilesyrup.com Privacy.

While Google is billing the over-the-air update as a “maintenance release” designed to improve the performance and stability of Android Nougat, it includes a pleasant surprise for Nexus 5X owners. According to 9to5Google, 7.1.2 allows Nexus 5X owners to enable a gesture called “swipe for notifications.” When enabled, the gesture allows Nexus 5X owners to check their notifications by swiping down on the smartphone’s fingerprint sensor. Previously, this gesture was exclusive to the Pixel and Pixel XL.

The HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Sony Playstation VR are all out and Google has jumped in big time with its Cardboard-replacing Daydream. One can only guess at what announcements will be coming in 2017 (Apple, where are you?). Of course, content has also had a full year to develop and we've tracked some of these developments at Tribeca and at Fantastic Fest. This year's New Frontier slate saw quite a bit of innovation, including a much larger set of spaces spread out across multiple locations in Park City. On its face, there seemed to be less focus on 360 storytelling than last year with more pieces for the PC powerhouse-requiring Vive and Rift. This may be as much to do with the challenges to storytelling in 360 as the ability to be innovative with interactivity on the PCs. Sundance has always focused on the artistic innovation of New Frontier and frankly, we just don't have the tools to be that innovative with our storytelling in 360 yet (jump to the end to see what Google is doing to combat that issue head on). Regardless, there were plenty of artistic and innovative pieces on display at New Frontier. This year's program was undoubtedly a huge success. It was impossible to try everything, but here are a few quick words on what we were able to squeeze in. Dear Angelica This fully narrative love letter is an absolutely beautiful piece to experience. It's directed by Saschka Unseld in collaboration with illustrator Wesley Allsbrook and the Oculus Story Studio. The result is an incredibly stylized form of 3D animation that was made using Oculus's Quill software (not dissimilar from Google Tilt Brush's style). But this is some advanced level animation and the 3D aspects are some of the coolest we've ever seen. The story is sweet and voice work by Geena Davis and Mae Whitman a nice touch. There is a lot going on all around you and at times you may feel anxious that you are looking in the wrong place. In fact, a note after you've finished lets you know you should go back and pause it to see everything there is to see. It will be well worth the time to explore this masterful piece further. Chocolate Probably the coolest music video ever created for VR, Tyler Hurd (of Gentle Manhands) has created this interactive world set to the song of the same name from the band Giraffage. In it you play some sort of God-like creature tasked with shooting cats out of your arms until the other Gods come and shower you with champagne. It's 100% as ridiculous as it sounds but the interactive elements made possible by the Vive/Rift controllers paired with the super lovable graphics make this piece a total blast. Asteroids! The latest piece from Invasion! creator Eric Darnell of Baobab Studios again brings the lovable aliens to a fully immersive world. This time, instead of just observing, the user is thrust into the action with a semi-interactive element that has you pointing and clicking a bit to keep the narrative moving forward. This is, without a doubt, one of the highest quality animated experiences available in VR. Mindshow The brainchild of Visionary VR, it's hard to understate just how revolutionary Mindshow could be as a storytelling platform. This program puts you in the middle of your own little skit, and lets you interact with other characters. This will likely only make sense if you try it yourself, but rest assured, you've never done anything like this before. It's like you are creating your own interactive story in which you are both the writer and the star. You can then save and share your creations. The demo only scratches the surface of what is possible on the platform but expect big things when it launches in full. My Brother's Keeper This PBS-produced Civil War piece included some very cool action sequences. It puts you right in the heart of a Civil War reenactment and the action is frenetic. It's particularly effective when the troops are sneaking through a creek, the tense air of an impending battle all around. The piece also employs some interesting 180 degree framing to keep the viewer focused. It's an interesting tactic but still experimental. Microdose Perhaps best described as Tilt Brush on acid, this piece by Vision Agency Inc. is a fully interactive non-narrative experience for the Vive that allows you to draw technology-inspired shapes in a trippy 3D world. The interface is much less defined than Tilt Brush and it's hard to know exactly what you're doing (there are worlds you can kind of warp around for different tools), but as an art project it's positively infectious. Titanic VR Just as simple as it sounds, this very short animated experience by Immersive VR Education puts you in a rowboat as the Titanic cruises by on its way towards its eventual fate. It's perhaps a bit heavy handed with the docu elements but it's undeniably cool to feel the scale of the massive ship from well beneath. This is just a short teaser of the full experience to come which promises a more immersive experience. Melting Ice This 360 docu piece by Condition One and Participant Media takes you inside one of the most compelling sequences from An Inconvenient Sequel where Al Gore tours a rapidly melting glacier in Greenland. The piece gives you a good sense of the scale of the glacier melt via static shots in various dramatic parts of the glacier and pretty cool ride on the bow of a boat. The Price of Freedom This piece by Construct Studio is probably best described as a VR Escape Room. The puzzles aren't super hard but you do get a bit of a feeling of desperation as you pick up items and look for clues. This definitely falls on the game side of the narrative divide but it's an innovative form of storytelling nonetheless. Through You Saschka Unseld and Lily Baldwin's highly stylized 360 narrative piece is a trip through an entire lifetime of love. It features some very cool camera movements around our main dancers and some beautiful sets and costumes. If Not Love This fully narrative mostly omnipresent 360 video takes you inside a nightclub shooting and explores how the events that lead to the tragedy might have unfolded differently. YouTube's stab at defining the grammar of VR A few final words for what Google is doing between their Daydream and YouTube teams. There is a lot of talk in the VR narrative space about the tools we need to tell stories. Quite frankly we have yet to define the grammar of VR narratives. What replaces the shot-reverse shot or our current form of continuity editing? These methods came about from experimentation and, likewise, the grammar of VR storytelling with undoubtedly emerge in the same fashion. So one big question is, how do we fund this experimentation? Google has come up with a pretty compelling answer to that question. By putting VR capture tools into the hands of their YouTube creators, Google is looking to get a whole ton of people capturing and posting 360-video to their YouTube channels. That's important because these creators are already receiving revenue from these channels, so they're motivated to bring more content to those already established marketplaces where dollars are earned via views. Of course, a quick tour of the most successful YouTube channels doesn't exactly inspire a lot of comparisons to Georges Méliès or Sergei Eisenstein. Much of the YouTube VR content that has been generated by this initiative amounts to a tour of the YouTube creator's apartment. But it can't be denied that this is an innovative answer to a burning question of how to pay for experimentation and we are certainly hopeful for its outcome. 2 Sign-In to Vote Tweet 0 Submit 1 Do you feel this content is inappropriate or infringes upon your rights?

M Friday, Feb 03 2017 | Updated at 04:25 AM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Feb 02, 2017 01:49 AM EST By Erwin Castro, UniversityHerald Reporter Latest Google Cloud Platform Offerings Wages War At Microsoft's Cash Cow And Core Business Google has one of the most prestigious internship programs for 2017 (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Google Cloud is making some big announcement that will lure customers who are using Windows platform in their IT data centers to the Google Cloud Platform. The search giant made the big announcement this week. Google Launches New Cloud Offerings According to TechCrunch, the Mountain View-based company has announced the availability of pre-configured images for Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise and Windows Server Core on the Google Cloud. The moves mean only one thing-- IT pros can now launch pre-configured virtual machines running any of these products on Google Cloud Platform. They can also bring an existing SQL Server license. In addition to the SQL Server Enterprise and Windows Server Core, Google also announced support for SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups, which targets customers who are concerned about disaster recovery and high availability issues when running critical operations in a cloud setting. Then and finally, all of the Windows Server images are now enabled with Windows Remote Management support, including the Windows Server Core 2016 and 2012 R2 images. IT admins can check or visit Google Cloud websites for more information about this release. They can also check Windows on Google Cloud page and SQL Server on Google Cloud page for more other important updates. Latest Moves Aimed At Microsoft's Core Business As mentioned earlier by TechCrunch, the latest cloud moves takes aim at Microsoft customers with the new Windows VM offerings Google Cloud Developer Tool, lead product manager Chris Sells said in a statement that this is just part of a much broader strategy to support Windows products on Google Cloud Platform. With these developments, Google is now ready to take on enterprise customers running these Windows-based products. Sells also added that the latest cloud moves are just an extension of a much bigger effort that began last year when Google began supporting other Windows products such SQL Server 2008 and 2012. Launched in 2011, Google Cloud Platform is a cloud computing service that offers hosting on the same supporting infrastructure that other Google services used. The search giant's cloud service also provides a set of modular cloud-based services with a host of development tools, which include translations and prediction APIs, hosting and computing, cloud storage, and data storage. Here are some of the main components of the Google Cloud Platform: Google Compute Engine is an IaaS service similar to Amazon EC2. Google App Engine is a PaaS service for directly hosting applications. This one is more similar to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. BigTable is an IaaS service that provides map reduce services, just like what Hadoop is doing these days. BigQuery is an IaaS service providing the columnar database. BigQuery works like Amazon Redshift. Google Cloud Functions, which still in alpha testing, is a FaaS service allowing functions to be triggered by events without developer resource management. Much like IBM OpenWhisk or Amazon Lambda.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology How (and why) to use Google Photos on your iPhone or iPad Emily Ferron 6 pictures How to use Google Photos for iOS to conquer your iPhone's photo storage issuesView gallery - 6 images Many iPhone users have wrestled with storage limits, especially when it comes to managing the device's camera roll. Apart from deleting old pics and purchasing a paid iCloud subscription, there's another option for alleviating storage woes: using Google Photos for iOS. Below, we provide instructions for backing up all of the photos on your phone to Google Drive via the Google Photos for iOS app, so you can delete them from your phone (and the iCloud) as needed. Download & install the app The Google Photos for iOS app is free. Download and install the app on your iPhone or iPad. When you launch it for the first time, you'll be asked to sign into your Google account. If you've used any other Google services, including Gmail, use the same credentials. If you have more than one Google account, choose carefully. Make sure you're selecting the account you want to associate your photo library with for the long term. Back up & sync for the first time Next, you'll encounter the Back up & sync screen. Here, you'll set your preferences for how the photos saved on your device should be uploaded to the Google Drive cloud. The app walks you through the steps. Here, switch the "Back up & sync" toggle to the blue on position. Whether you wish to enable cellular data for this sync and future syncing is up to you, but we recommend leaving it off (assuming you have access to a Wi-Fi network) so you don't inadvertently put a strain on your data plan. You can always change this and other settings later. Hit Continue. The next screen asks you to confirm upload size. Here, you should choose "High Quality" for two reasons. One, photos uploaded at this size do not count against the 15 GB of free Google Drive storage associated with your Google Account. Two, it won't affect the quality of the photos you've taken on your iPhone: The high quality option compresses photos to a 16 MP maximum, but at this point, all iPhones already take photos at 16 MP or smaller. Once you hit continue, the back up & sync process begins (presuming you are on a Wi-Fi network or using cellular data). The more photos you have, the longer this automated process will take, so don't be worried if it takes a while to finish up. Confirm uploads, explore Google Photos Once you're finished, it's time to familiarize yourself with the Google Photos interface. When you open the app again, you'll have access to your photo and video content through three tabs: Assistant, Photos and Albums. Under Photos and Albums, you can peruse and organize your content. In addition, the Assistant screen has a few organizational shortcuts (Create Album, Collage, Animation, Movie, etc.) for easy searching, sharing and editing. Below, you'll see a feed of auto-created content that Google Photos generated from your photos and videos. You may see animations, edited photos, collages and more. Assistant view, Google Photos for iOS To access your photos from a computer, just navigate to Google Photos in your browser and sign into your account. There, you can see your content and an expanded version of the mobile interface anytime, anywhere. You can also download or share photos as needed. Free up storage on your iOS device Once you're satisfied that your iOS device's photos have been uploaded to your Google Photos account, you're ready to delete them from your phone or tablet. You can either do this piecemeal through Apple's Photos app, or you can use a built-in Google Photos tool to do so all at once. To use Google Photos, open the app and tap the three-line menu icon on the top left portion of the screen. Select "Free up space" from the menu. From there, Google Photos detects images and videos saved on your local device that have already been backed up by Google. You'll receive a notification asking to confirm the removal. Once you're ready, hit Remove. The only downside of removing these photos from your local device is that you will not be able to share or post them directly from apps like Messages, Mail or social media. However, you can do all of these directly through Google Photos: Open the app, Tap "Photos", then select the item you wish to share. Tap the square sharing icon in the lower left hand corner and make your selection. Sharing directly from Google Photos You can also download or delete individual items from your local device on at a time. After you select the image in question, tap the three-dot menu icon in the upper right corner. If the image is already on your device, you'll see a "Delete from device" option. If it's not, you'll see "Download" instead. Using Google Photos to replace the iCloud Photo Library After you've uploaded your photo library to Google Photos and cleared up space on your device, you can either go back to using the built-in iOS photo library and tools, or you can use Google Photos to replace the iCloud Photo Library. If you just want to do a one-time backup to Google Photos, then turn off the "Back up & sync" function in Google Photos. Open the app on your device, then go the Menu > Settings > Back up & sync. You can always do another backup if you run into more storage issues. If you leave "Back up & sync" on, Google Photos automatically syncs photos from your camera roll to the cloud when you launch the app. In this way, it provides convenient cloud storage similar to the iCloud but with fewer constraints. Most notably, you'll never run out of storage, as long as you're uploading in high (rather than full) quality. Other advantages? If you ever decide to switch to Android, it will be easy to access all of your photos on your new device. Also, Google Photos' automatic organization tools are arguably more accurate, and more fun to use, than those in Apple Photos. If you have Google Photos continually backing up and syncing, it's safe to turn off the iCloud Photo Library on your device (Settings > Photos & Camera > iCloud Photo Library). This frees up your iCloud for essentials like device backups, so you can keep using your beloved iPhone without being subject to Apple's stingy cloud policies.

Go fire up Google real quick and type in “Roger Goodell lies” and hit the enter button. As you’ll see, there’s no shortage of internet material dedicated to exposing the supposed fibs spoken by the NFL commissioner. In fact, Google says there’s “about” 240,000 results, and a Google search of just “Goodell lies” actually brings you nearly 400,000 results. When it comes to giving his word, Goodell’s as reliable as Matt Cushman in “Jerry Maguire.” It’s near impossible to comb through those results and prove they’re all lies, but to say there’s some distrust between the face of the NFL and its fans would be a slight understatement. Domestic violence incidents, integrity of the game, Deflategate and the supplemental discipline process tied to all three have hurt the credibility of Goodell and the NFL. But Goodell’s continued insistence on saying the league’s Thursday night product actually is a good product might be one of his biggest stretches of the truth yet. Goodell, at his yearly state of the game news conference Wednesday, talked about the supposed health of the Thursday night games in a matter that was questionable even by his standards. Let’s dig a little deeper, shall we? (Goodell’s comments in bold and italics.) “‘Thursday Night Football’ is something that we are very committed to. ‘Thursday Night Football’ ended up being the No. 2-rated show on all of primetime on NBC this year and No. 4 on CBS.” Shocking. In a question about whether less might be more when it comes to Thursday night, Goodell starts by talking ratings, because ratings equal money, and Goodell, in his defense, is doing his job: making the owners money. That’s his priority. “So we see our fans reacting positively to that.” Another staple of the NFL, basically saying “Because the ratings are good, that means fans are watching, and if fans are watching, the product must be good.” In theory, it makes sense, but we’re also addicts. We’ll watch our favorite teams when they’re on, and if they’re not playing, we’ll still find a way to gamble on the games or follow our fantasy teams or really do anything to distract us from the fact that our time on this world is fleeting. (That’s a little dark, but you get the picture.) “There is a lot of discussion about the safety of the game, but we have seen absolutely no indications that there is any further risk of injuries, and injury rates are actually slightly lower on Thursday night than they are on Sunday.” Neat. What that exactly means is anyone’s guess. A strong statement with vague details or explanation, otherwise known as “The Goodell.” “When it relates to the quality of the game, we’ve seen that be incredibly positive also. We’ve seen less turnovers. We’ve seen less penalties on almost every aspect of what you would say the quality of the game. We’ve seen high-quality football on Thursday night.” The average margin of victory on Thursday night games in 2016 exceeded 11 points. Four games were decided by at least three touchdowns, and five more were decided by at least 12 points. But at least there were fewer turnovers and penalties. One of the best games — Minnesota and Dallas in Week 13 — came on a week after those two teams played the Thursday before (Thanksgiving) and had a full week to prepare. “We put all 32 teams on there. That’s something we did.” No real point here. Just fun to take this quote out of context. “We are thinking about whether we reevaluate that and maybe don’t have quite the number of teams …” Basically, “We’re thinking about whether we should continue to put the Jaguars and Titans in primetime every season.” Good call. Goodell finished his answer with this: “So we are going to look at all of that, and continue to work on something that we think has gotten off to an incredible start and we are very optimistic about the future on that.” Incredible and optimistic. Financially, sure. The NFL, despite all its warts, continues to make money hand over first, and no matter how much we complain, there’s not going to be wide-scale change until the bottom line takes a hit. That’s just the way it is. Expecting the NFL to do otherwise is foolish. But this definitely feels like one of those times the league should listen to its players. Players like Richard Sherman, who called Thursday night games a “poopfest” and doubled down with an article on The Players’ Tribune literally titled “Why I Hate Thursday Night Football.” “We’ve seen blowouts, sloppy play and games that have been almost unwatchable — and it’s not the players’ faults. Their bodies just aren’t ready to play,” he wrote. Sherman added:”‘Thursday Night Football’  is just another example of the NFL’s hypocrisy: The league will continue a practice that diminishes the on-field product and endangers its players, but as long as the dollars keep rolling in, it couldn’t care less.” Amen. If Goodell came out and simply touted the financial boon that comes from diluting the product by having a Thursday night game every week, that’s fine. But to say it’s a high-quality product — at least compared to what we see on Sunday — is, well, a lie. Thumbnail photo via Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports Images Have a question for Mike Cole?

Peter ElstromSaritha Rai The draft of US President Donald Trump’s executive order covers an alphabet soup of visa programmes, including H1B, L-1, E-2 and B1. Photo: Reuters Tokyo/Bengaluru: President Donald Trump’s clash with Silicon Valley over immigration is about to become even more contentious. After the new president banned refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Microsoft and others railed against the move, saying it violated the country’s principles and risked disrupting its engine of innovation. Trump’s next steps could strike even closer to home: His administration has drafted an executive order aimed at overhauling the work-visa programmes , including the H1B visas, that technology companies depend on to hire tens of thousands of employees each year. If implemented, the reforms could force wholesale changes at India companies such as Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, and shift the way American companies like Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. recruit talent. Companies would have to try to hire American first and if they recruit foreign workers, priority would be given to the most highly paid. ALSO READ | From GE to Google: The uneasy test of doing business under Donald Trump “Our country’s immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the US national interest,” the draft proposal reads, according to a copy reviewed by Bloomberg. “Visa programs for foreign workers … should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of American workers and current lawful residents, and that prioritizes the protection of American workers—our forgotten working people—and the jobs they hold.” The foreign work visas were originally established to help US companies recruit from abroad when they couldn’t find qualified local workers. But in recent years, there have been allegations the programs have been abused to bring in cheaper workers from overseas to fill jobs that otherwise may go to Americans. The top recipients of the H1B visas are outsourcers, primarily from India, who run the technology departments of large corporations with largely imported staff. “If firms are using the program for cheap labour, I think it will affect them and they will have to pay workers more,” said Ron Hira, an associate professor at Howard University. “If tech firms are using the program for specialized labour, they may find there are more visas available.” The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment on the draft. The proposal is consistent with the president’s public comments on pushing companies to add more jobs to the US, from auto manufacturing to technology. It’s not clear how much force the executive order would have if it is signed by the president. Congress is also working on visa reforms and the parties will have to cooperate to pass new laws. Zoe Lofgren, a Democratic congresswoman from California, introduced a bill last week to tighten requirements for the H1B work visa program. ALSO READ | US tech leaders sound alarm over Trump immigration order “My legislation refocuses the H1B program to its original intent—to seek out and find the best and brightest from around the world, and to supplement the US workforce with talented, highly-paid, and highly-skilled workers,” Lofgren said in a statement. India’s technology companies, led by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys and Wipro, have argued they are helping corporations become more competitive by handling their technology operations with specialized staff. They also contend the visa programs allow them to keep jobs in the US and that if they have to pay more for staff, they will handle more of the work remotely from less expensive markets like India. “Inspections and investigations in the past have shown no cases of wrongdoing by Indian IT services companies, which have always been fully compliant with the law,” said R. Chandrashekhar, president of Nasscom, the trade group for India’s information technology sector. “The industry is open to any kind of checks in the system, but they should not cause any hindrance to the smooth operation of companies.” Wipro and TCS declined to comment for this story. A spokeswoman for Infosys said the company is monitoring the US visa proposals, but it is too early to assess their impact given the uncertainty of what will be approved. “We continue to hire and invest locally,” the company said in an e-mail. “However, given the skill shortages in the US and the availability of technically skilled workforce in various global markets, we also rely upon visa programs to supplement these skills. For the long term, we are also exploring new operating models to ensure business continuity as we navigate this dynamic environment. This includes reducing our visa dependency and efforts towards making Infosys a preferred employer in the US.” ALSO READ | Donald Trump’s order on refugees, immigration: What we know so far The draft of Trump’s executive order covers an alphabet soup of visa programs, including H1B, L-1, E-2 and B1. The first is a popular program with technology companies and is aimed at allowing them to bring in high-skill workers when they can’t find local hires with the appropriate skills. The legislation caps the number of people who can enter the US annually at 85,000, including those with undergrad and master’s degrees. In recent years though, outsourcing companies have received the most H1B visas, while other tech companies have struggled to get all they want. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the top five recipients were all outsourcing companies, led by Tata Consultancy. Hira, who has done extensive research on the subject, points out workers at outsourcers are typically not treated as well as others. The median wage at outsourcing firms for H1B workers was less than $70,000, while Apple, Google and Microsoft paid their employees in the program more than $100,000, according to data he collected. That suggests the American companies are going after true, highly skilled employees, while the outsourcers are recruiting less expensive talent, he said. The proposed Trump order is also aimed at bringing more transparency to the program. It calls for publishing reports with basic statistics on who uses the immigration programs within one month of the end of the government’s fiscal year. The Obama Administration had scaled back the information available on the programs and required Freedom of Information Act requests for some data. Whatever specific changes are implemented, they are likely to add to the expenses for India’s technology companies. That may accelerate a shift to new kinds of services, such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, said Raja Lahiri, partner at the Mumbai-based partner at consultancy Grant Thornton India “The visa challenges are not going to go away easily,” he said. “They will continue to be a challenge for Indian IT companies.” Bloomberg Peter ElstromSaritha Rai Topics: Donald TrumpH1B visasexecutive orderwork visasUS immigration ban More From Livemint READ MORE Gold prices extend losses on weak global cues Toshiba seeks exit from UK, India in nuclear retreat: report News in Numbers | Federal judges in 5 US states object to Trump’s immigration ban First Published: Mon, Jan 30 2017. 07 29 PM IST Editor's Picks Union Budget 2017: The hits and misses, according to Montek Singh Ahluwalia Ola’s valuation marked down 40% by US’s Vanguard Group The silver lining in H1B visa reforms Latest News Toshiba seeks exit from UK, India in nuclear retreat: report News in Numbers | Federal judges in 5 US states object to Trump’s immigration ban RBI may go for 25 bps repo rate cut next week: Deutsche Bank Remonetisation exercise nearly complete: Shaktikanta Das Attorney general’s office is not a public authority under the RTI Act: Delhi HC Mint On Sunday The real dangal What's really behind the Bhangar agitation?

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains why. Buzz60 Apple has been replaced by Google as the most valuable company in the world, according to a new report from Brand Finance. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) Apple, the most valuable brand in the world for the past five years, has yielded the top spot to Google, according to a new report. The iPhone maker's brand value has plummeted 27% to $107 billion since the start of last year, according to Brand Finance’s Global 500 2017 report. Google’s brand, however, is now worth $109 billion, making it the most lucrative in the world. It is the first time the search giant has topped the list since 2011. After Google and Apple are Amazon, AT&T and Microsoft. Google’s place as the dominant search engine safeguards its stream of advertising revenue, which increased 20% last year. The uptick occurred even though marketers are paying less for page views generated by those searching online. Apple, meanwhile, is losing its grip on some tech-crazed consumers. The Apple Watch has not been the moneymaker the company had hoped it would become. A company that was once renowned for its innovation is not signaling that it has another unique product coming anytime soon. And Apple’s list of competitors in the smartphone space is continuing to grow, the report says. This week, however, Apple showed that its signature iPhone still has the potential to be a profit machine, buoying investors. Robust sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus over the holidays led to the tech giant to just report it earned $17.9 billion, or $3.36 a share in the first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31. Though the net income was off 2.7% from $18.4 billion in the same quarter a year ago, revenue was a record-setting revenue of $78.4 billion. Apple beat analysts' profit expectations. Meanwhile, Google's parent company Alphabet reported reported net income of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share, for the fourth quarter. It missed analysts' estimates, though revenue soared 22% to $26 billion. The revenue growth was propelled by mobile search, video ads, and its expansion in newer business lines like cloud computing. While technology was dominant among the world's most valuable companies, the banking industry was next in having the most lucrative brands, followed by the telecom sector, retail and the car industry. 10202 CONNECTTWEET 73 LINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jZxv4a NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Coren Obsession "America First" February 02, 2017 A sign of the past? (Monica Almeida / Reuters) Share Written by Michael J. Coren Obsession "America First" February 02, 2017 For skilled immigrants around the world, California’s Silicon Valley is the promised land. Over the last few decades, San Jose and San Francisco have become home to tens of thousands of people from around the world with degrees in science, engineering, and math. Many have built crucial new technologies at Facebook, Microsoft, and other companies. Some founded multi-billion-dollar companies, including Google, Uber, Intel, and Tesla. Historically, US immigration policy invited the world’s smartest and most innovative minds to come, learn, and do business in the country. US president Donald Trump is preparing to revoke that invitation. His draft proposals, along with an executive order on Jan. 27 halting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the country’s entire refugee program, promise to remake America’s immigration rules, including those covering H-1B work visas. The rules as drafted would likely tighten quotas, impose heavy limitations on foreign students, eliminate spouses’ ability to apply for work, and enact measures curtailing the tech industry’s options to attract and keep talent. Protestors against Trump’s executive order on immigration gather outside Terminal 4 at JFK airport on Jan. 28. (Reuters/Joe Penney) Jon Zieger, general counsel at San Francisco-based payments company Stripe, which was started by two Irish immigrant brothers, warned the measures will shut out the world’s best students and engineers from studying at US schools, who might then join or start US companies. “The restrictions on immigration are going to hurt the tech sector and hurt the US economy more broadly,” he said in an interview. “Immigration is fundamental to every industry that requires high-skilled and technical labor.” A fight over H-1B visas Silicon Valley’s anxiety is, in part, a question of supply and demand. Three times more people apply for H-1B visas than is allowed under the annual quota of 85,000 (about half of which go to tech). Even rumors of curtailment of the visa have tanked the stocks of outsourcing firms in India, where most contract workers originate. While the program is criticized for permitting some foreign software developers willing to work for less than US workers, University of California Davis researchers say H-1B workers across all professions generated 10% to 20% in annual productivity growth, adding $615 billion to the US economy between 1990 and 2010. But tech’s reaction is also deeply personal. People born outside the country have founded more than half of America’s private start-ups valued at $1 billion dollars or more, according to a report by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) (pdf), a non-partisan think tank. Once companies with immigrants in key management or product roles are included, the share grows to 70% of so-called unicorns as of 2016. Not coincidentally, the US has awarded more patents to immigrants in the last decade than any other country. “This Administration wants to gut American immigration history and this starts with potential company founders in Silicon Valley,” said Matthew La Corte, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian think-tank Niskanen Center in Washington, DC. “What we should be doing is spread the H-1B to as many companies as possible to spread the benefits…Why not rely on entrepreneurs who have already proven they can start companies and who can come create jobs.” An expansion the H-1B program looks unlikely to say the least. GOP legislation proposed by senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Alabama senator and prospective US attorney general Jeff Sessions would essentially end the H-1B program by requiring all applicants to have a PhD, at least ten years of experience, and to receive a minimum salary of $110,000 up from the current $60,000. “Few if any of the billion dollar startup companies with an immigrant founder would have been started in the United States,” if this law had been in place, reports the NFAP (pdf). But legislators in both parties are eagerly introducing reform bills (some far more supportive of H-1B). All remain stalled without White House guidance. But if Trump’s campaign rhetoric and leaked documents send a message to immigrants, that message is clear: Leave. The latest draft executive orders from the White House sketch out a broad reframing of the nation’s approach to immigration. While few rules have been formulated, agencies from the State Department to the Department of Homeland Security would be asked to study all costs from immigrants for public services, the potential cost savings and rule changes in the “public interest.” Tech against the president Silicon Valley companies have already gone to war against Trump’s executive orders. “The tech community is powerful,” wrote Sam Altman, president of the seed fund Y Combinator, on his blog on Jan 29. “We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally.” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper, and Expedia are filing statements supporting the suit by Washington state’s attorney general against Trump’s executive order banning refugees. Apple CEO Tim Cook also said he’s lobbying “very, very senior people in the White House” to roll back the order in an interview (paywall) with the Wall Street Journal. Tesla CEO Elon Musk of Tesla and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, members of Trump’s Strategic & Policy Forum, have vowed on Twitter to take proposals backing immigration to the President. Lyft co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green pledged $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union on the company’s blog on Jan 29. Airbnb is offering free housing and Uber created a $3 million legal defense fund for drivers with immigration issues. A host of others including Box, Dropbox, Google, Postmates, Salesforce, Amazon, Apple, Autodesk, and Intel took to Twitter to express their opposition.

Immigration is unambiguously an economic benefit, but, doesn't matter: do the right thing because it's right. — Stewart Butterfield (@stewart) January 28, 2017 But critics, including Trump, charge technology executives are less interested in American ideals than in their ability to make outsized returns for themselves and their investors. By importing cheaper labor, companies can depress US wages and reap the profits. “The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: These are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,” Trump said in March 2016 statement. “I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse.” Indeed, several companies including Siemens and Disney have been accused of doing exactly that (despite companies that use it for the intended purpose of recruiting exceptional and hard-to-find workers from doctors to engineers). An investigation by the The Center for Investigative Reporting revealed several cases where cheap, overseas contractors with H-1B visas were used to replace American workers. In a few galling cases, Americans were even asked to train their low-paid replacements from Indian outsourcing firms that now account for the majority of the H-1B visas issued, reports Bloomberg. The startup visa That association may doom a second policy welcomed by Silicon Valley, the Obama-era International Entrepreneur Rule, also called the “startup visa.” Although scheduled to go into effect this summer, Trump froze its implementation on his first day in office. The rule gives the Department of Homeland Security “parole” authority, typically used for humanitarian relief, to let non-citizens work on their companies in the US for two years and apply for a three-year extension to remain if they can show “potential for rapid business growth and job creation” and secure funding from investors or government entities. While Trump’s draft orders do not single out the Entrepreneur Rule, they would eliminate any use of parole that “circumvents statutory immigration policy,” essentially killing it. Other countries are moving in the opposite direction: 13 countries now offer some sort of startup visa, and Canada’s tech community is lobbying Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to craft a visa to scoop up talent that the US rejects. Trump signs an executive action on extreme vetting for immigrants at the Pentagon in Washington on Jan. 27, 2017. (Susan Walsh / AP Photo) Trump’s immigration proposals are only partially achievable by executive order. Congress must cooperate to make any major changes in the H-1B visa program. But if Trump’s campaign promises are implemented, the US may ultimately see its economy sputter. Non-partisan, independent scholars who have studied the immigration question for decades have an unequivocal answer: Immigrants are a net win for the US economy, jobs, and wages. Five hundred economists (including five Nobel laureates) wrote former US President George W. Bush in 2005 that “vastly more Americans benefit from the contributions that immigrants make to our economy, including lower consumer prices,” despite a small drop in wages for native-born Americans working low-skilled jobs. While Trump himself is the son of an immigrant (his mother came from Scotland) and two of his three wives were immigrants, Niskanen’s La Corte is doubtful that the administration’s review of the data will reach a similar conclusion. “We’ve seen if you want to work for this President, if you don’t provide the expected answers, you’re out of the job,” he said. Even if the data is on Silicon Valley’s side, the populist revolt Trump is leading may sink all immigration, beneficial or not. At its heart, writes David Frum at The Atlantic, immigration is a class dispute. Focusing on the benefits to the “average American” ignores real (if small) harms to some low-skilled Americans and overlooks the fact that the US currently enjoys the lowest workforce participation of working-age American men in recorded history. While America has always been a nation of immigrants, its share of foreign-born citizens in the US stands at the near-record high of 14%, up from the 5% in 1965, says Pew. It’s not surprising that voters who elected Trump appear ready to sweep away the relatively welcoming immigration consensus that has prevailed since 1965. The Valley itself is a poster child for the class divide. The digital economy has built a rapidly stratifying society. Winners (urban, educated and white-collar) are pulling ahead while those outside the radius of America’s technological prosperity have seen their prospects and cultural influence fade. Citizens excluded from Silicon Valley’s glittering promise may decide that when it comes to immigration, no one deserves those benefits after all.

SUBSCRIBE Methbot, fake news and five other reasons SEM/SEO interest will surge Columnist Kevin Lee is predicting that 2017 will be another great year for paid search, due in part to events both within and outside of the industry. Kevin Lee on February 2, 2017 at 11:22 am More Based on what I’ve seen across my diverse set of clients, and talking to others in the industry, I’m predicting 2017 will be another great year for paid search. One of the reasons is a bit unusual: a flight to quality online media driven in part by “fake news,” “Methbot” and advertisers’ realization that they prefer not to have their advertising associated with those sites, don’t want their advertising positioned with that content, and in some cases have ethical concerns about supporting the publishers. So, let’s look a bit further into this flight to quality. I’ve spoken to a number of advertisers who are concerned about being associated with, or seen as supporting, fake news sites with their display media buys. To some extent, the explosion of fake news has created a flight to quality within not only display advertising, but across the overall digital budget. Meanwhile, Facebook has eroded the perception of data accuracy for any of its reporting. This may have a chilling effect on Facebook spend growth. (Although most direct response advertisers rely more on their post-impression and post-click metrics than they do the suspect data coming out of the FB interface. Brand advertisers may be more sensitive to the measurement issues and push for third-party measurement or perhaps for MRC certification/audit. Therefore, I think any deceleration in ad spend growth at Facebook is probably temporary.) That’s great news for paid search — because when we think about trustworthy sites and publishers, where the context of the page won’t reflect poorly on the advertiser, there’s nothing better than SEM. I’ve even spoken to advertisers who proactively raised SEM budgets while cutting back on display surgically (with an eye to low-quality and fake news sites). Therefore, while SEM and SEO have been around for a long time, and at this point it’s hard to imagine a surge of interest in SEM and SEO, I believe that the flight to quality is just one of a variety of factors that have aligned to renew interest in search marketing in 2017 and beyond. Let’s look at the additional interest acceleration factors I’ve identified. Better bot filtering and more humans. Despite the challenges that Google has had fighting bots, particularly within the Google Display Network, the lion’s share of search traffic against which Google sells advertising originates from Google itself. That gives Google much more control over identification of bots or other suspicious search activity. Just recently within the digital video and display sector, White Ops discovered a Russian bot farm defrauding advertisers of billions. Mobile search growth continues to rise domestically and internationally. Further growth may come from consumer satisfaction with voice search results (displaying a SERP). At some point, Google is probably going to roll out some kind of audio ad that consumers can select within voice search and as part of the call extensions/click-to-call functionality. Mid-sized marketers have finally gotten their mobile-friendly websites relaunched and are ready to spend. Sure, the top sites went adaptive/responsive, and perhaps even implemented AMP within a short time frame. But there are thousands of sites that are only recently adaptive and responsive, and those marketers can’t afford to ignore the mobile searcher. Increasing use of engaging ad formats. PLA ads for retailers are just the beginning, and the level of customizability with PLA extensions keeps escalating. Local inventory availability will further drive investment into PLAs, and I fully expect there to be some new ad unit announcements by Google within the next eight months. But that’s a guess and a prediction based purely on prior behavior and the changing landscape. Search covers the bottom and top of the marketing funnel (if you still believe in funnels). Even though the classic marketing funnel has leaks, it’s clear that not everyone is in the “ready to buy” mode — even when they have engaged in search behavior, which is a great barometer of intent. Each keyword has its own success metrics, easily observable — as well as a halo effect on your overall campaign — as those who did not buy or engage with you based on your primary marketing objective. Better retargeting within the digital marketing channel. Search is a great way to build an audience, and that audience, when retargeted, exhibits great eventual conversion metrics in nearly every case. So, retargeting adds value to the original search click, justifying increased spend on search as well as retargeting. There are probably more factors that will occur to me after this article publishes, so please share your own opinions on which other factors (or which of the ones I’ve listed) will have the greatest impact via social media. Will search be the beneficiary of all the bad news out of the rest of the digital ad sector? I think so. What do you think?

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve HUL x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Hindustan UniLever x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ NEW DELHI: Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Adobe have become the latest among top recruiters to skip final placements at Indian Institutes of Technology this year. They now join a growing list of marquee companies — the likes of Google, McKinsey and Facebook — that are avoiding the official channel to recruit from the top engineering colleges. The formal process entails recruiters visiting a campus and interviewing candidates, usually starting December when the final placement season begins for most IITs, before making an offer. While that involves looking at the final year students of one institute at a time, companies are now pitting candidates across IITs against each other through simultaneous online tests and other means, as they try to cherry-pick the best from a larger pool. Adobe may adopt this strategy starting this year, screening candidates through online tests followed by interviews, and stop visiting campuses, said people in the know. HUL seems to have exited final campus placements partially, as it stayed away from IITs for the second year in a row. But the consumer goods company has still been hiring IITians through pre-placement offers — giving permanent job offers to interns who suit its requirements. Adobe hired over a dozen engineers from at least three IITs last year, including five from IIT Bombay. The software company, as well as Google, Facebook and McKinsey didn’t respond to request for comment. HUL didn’t confirm its absence from the IITs during campus placements and said it is open to hiring through the formal channel. India has 23 IITs of which 17 have the class of 2017 getting placed — the rest are new institutes, started in 2015 and 2016. The institutes aren’t happy about the new strategy of recruiters. "IITs do not entertain companies that chose to go off-campus. Companies like HUL that are not coming for final placement in December but are coming for picking up interns are still welcome,” said IIT Kharagpur career development centre chairperson Debasis Deb. Other IITs are also not overly worried about the partial exit by some companies. “As long as companies are coming to the IITs for PPOs (pre-placement offers), there is nothing to worry about,” said Anishya Madan, IIT-Delhi’s training and placement cell, industrial liaison officer. The internship route gives the companies and students time to test each other for potential employment. “The two-month internship window provides a good opportunity to observe them in action and assess them from a long-term career perspective and we are equally open to hire candidates through the final placement route, based on quality of profiles and the overall demand forecast,” said an HUL spokesperson in an emailed response to ET. Google, too, has partially moved to off-campus hiring as this year it visited only one IIT, Bombay, for final placement. The American search giant has been increasingly hiring final-year IIT students directly, according to people at IIT’s placement cells. McKinsey and Facebook have also been conducting online tests for screening and selection of students while staying off the official process, according to placement source at IIT Kharagpur. Skipping the final placements takes the pressure off the companies in the scramble for premium engineering talent. This also takes care of simultaneous access to talent across campuses, reducing the cost and man hours required. “Instead of participating in a mad rush for zero slots at the campuses to grab the premium talent, companies are increasingly reserving their resources and conducting online tests. This gives them a chance to pick up talent from all campuses at the same time,” said Anandorup Ghose, partner at HR consultant Aon Hewitt India. “If a company’s brand is strong enough, it will automatically attract talent,” he said, referring to companies like Google and McKinsey. Holding competitions is another hiring route becoming popular among companies like HUL, American Express and Goldman Sachs. “This gives these companies an opportunity to take a pick on the best talent as well as build a brand among the students,” said a student at IIT Delhi’s placement cell. “Only a few companies as of now are hiring students directly from the campuses. Most IITs do not encourage this but we are happy if the students’ interests are taken care of,” said IIT Roorkee professor and placement-in-charge NP Padhy.

Individuals and corporations from different parts of the world have expressed that they are against this move. Source: Livemint Indian-born Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, has raised $4 million, to be donated to the affected refugees all over the world. Google employees together contributed $2 million, and the remaining amount came out of Pichai's own pocket. The donation is being split into equal parts and sent to four different organisations — The American Civil Liberties Union, The Immigrant Legal Resource Center, The International Rescue Committee, and the UNHCR. This amount of $4 million is reportedly the largest humanitarian fund ever raised by the company over the years. Google's move is admirable, especially considering the fact that less than 200 employees were directly affected by this ban. Having expressed his disagreement with the president's decision, Pichai ensured the launch of this fund after announcing it in an internal staff memo. Pichai, himself an immigrant from India, addressed the employees of the company along with one of the founders, Sergey Brin, who is also an immigrant, with emotional testimonials. According to Forbes, the CEO of Google said, "This is something, there are some values, which are really near and dear to your heart. It’s foundational and it’s something you should never compromise on. The thing we’ve been debating for the past three days is one of them." Apart from that, several Google employees from eight of its campuses and the parent company Alphabet Inc organised a protest, expressing their concerns about the move. With all the turmoil all over the issue, this compassionate move by Sundar Pichai is receiving plenty of praise and admiration. Do you have an interesting story to share?

But is that what it is — some grounded extraterrestrial vehicle? The images, of course, set the internet to speculation overdrive, with skeptics cautioning that it was unlikely that the JPL had absent-mindedly left a UFO outside (if their intent has always been to deny the existence of UFOs). But one UFO researcher that specializes in investigating and debunking UFOs believes that the “flying saucer” does have a connection with exploring space, just more on the human side of the search. The Sun reported this week that photos from Google Earth hit the internet that apparently captured a “silver, circular object” at rest at the end of what appears to be a runway structure outside of a facility on Mesa Road, which is part of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). But that’s not all that was shown in the UFO video uploaded by name shame on YouTube (the Sun’s source). In the short clip, the user points out that at another moment in time (2014), the so-called “flying saucer” was off the straight stretch of what appears to be pavement and setting on ground in an area of scrub brush a bit farther away from the facility. A user named shame suggests the object has been on a “walkabout.” Conspiracy theorists have long associated NASA’s JPL as a warehouser of recovered UFOs and secret laboratories where extraterrestrial vehicles are studied and reverse-engineered for their advanced technology. Nigel Watson, the author of the UFO Investigations Manual, told the Daily Mail, “I doubt this is a captured extraterrestrial flying saucer. More likely it is a structure or vehicle that has a flying saucer shape.” He went on, “Secondly, why would they leave it out in the open to be spotted by the likes of Google Earth?” UFO hunters speculate that the image from Google Earth is that of a flying saucer outside of a NASA JPL facility. [Image by Esteban De Armas/Shutterstock] But Watson likens the flying saucer sighting to the recent spate of images being captured on NASA’s live feed cameras on the International Space Station. “Seeing strange anomalies on Google seems to be the latest craze that is rivaling the watching of live images from the International Space Station to get a glimpse of UFOs,” he said. “In most of these instances we see what we look for.” UFO hoax-busting site UFO of Interest was quick to offer a more NASA-nuanced explanation for the so-called UFO. They suggest that the “flying saucer” is actually the “test antenna” at the end of JPL’s 3000 Foot Range Mesa Antenna Measurement Facility. The facility tests the radio frequency performance certifications and calibration services in support of JPL research and technology tasks. The Mesa Antenna Measurement Facility is just one of many laboratories operated by the JPL in the area. The JPL, as many know, is responsible for maintaining communications with NASA’s numerous spacecraft on their varied missions throughout the solar system. The following was pulled from the “About JPL” page on its website. “The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a unique national research facility that carries out robotic space and Earth science missions. JPL helped open the Space Age by developing America’s first Earth-orbiting science satellite, creating the first successful interplanetary spacecraft, and sending robotic missions to study all the planets in the solar system as well as asteroids, comets and Earth’s moon. In addition to its missions, JPL developed and manages NASA’s Deep Space Network, a worldwide system of antennas that communicates with interplanetary spacecraft.” NASA’s JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) communicates to all of the agency’s spacecraft. [Image by Christopher Halloran/Shutterstock] It is through the JPL that NASA maintains contact with the Mars Curiosity Rover and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, whose transmissions of data have also been the source of a few UFO sightings over the years, as the Inquisitr has reported. However, NASA’s official position remains unchanged in that UFOs only exist as unexplained anomalies and that, as yet, alien life, intelligent or otherwise, has yet to be detected.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google eyes office drones for virtual ‘telepresence’ meetings By Ethan Baron / February 2, 2017 at 10:59 AM Drones may be buzzing overhead in office hallways and stairwells if Google goes ahead with technology it’s seeking to patent for “unmanned vehicles for collaboration.” The corporate world needs office drones to help conduct virtual meetings that allow those not actually present to appear by video feed, according to the patent application made public Feb. 2 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The problem, according to Google, is that equipment for such “telepresence” meetings can be expensive and unmovable, and can limit additional uses of the room it occupies. “A mobile component may provide an additional level of flexibility to a telepresence system, allowing the telepresence system to be moved into and around a plurality of different designated locations,” said the application, filed in August. Floor-going robots are an inadequate solution, Google said. “The size and energy consumption levels of this type of telepresence robot may hinder its ability to effectively navigate complicated spaces with limited open floor space for the robot to traverse,” the application said. “Additionally, this type of telepresence robot cannot traverse stairs, and would require on-site human intervention to access a work space on a different floor using an elevator.” Of course, stairs aren’t an issue for robots that fly. Enter the “remotely navigated airborne form of conveyance,” which could take the form of a quadcopter drone, Google said. “Implementation of a mobile telepresence system on a relatively compact and operationally efficient airborne platform such as a quadcopter may provide significant improvements in, for example, speed, maneuverability, energy consumption and the like, facilitating access to spaces which may be otherwise difficult to access by a larger and less maneuverable platform,” according to the application. The drone could carry audio-visual equipment including a rotating screen, and also be equipped with a system for projecting imagery onto walls or wall-mounted screens, Google said. Office drones could facilitate the benefits achieved by telepresence conferencing, such as reduced travel expenses and environmental impacts, plus “improved coordination and productivity,” the application said. They could also be used in education and health care, according to Google. The application appears to envisage a drone that allows for the virtual telepresence of one person, which would impose a requirement for multiple office drones for meetings in which more than one participant was to appear remotely. Also, the flying robots would have to be less noisy than those typically used outside. The application does not appear to contemplate that issue, but efforts are underway on a variety of fronts to build quieter drones.   Image: Google’s office drone for virtual meetings, as shown in a patent application (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: drone, Google, office drone, patent, quadcopter, telepresence, virtual, virtual meeting   More Posts in 1 Apple hit with class-action lawsuit for allegedly ‘breaking’ FaceTime video-calling on iPhones to save money February 2, 2017   Uber faces more protests Thursday over CEO’s Trump ties February 2, 2017   Google co-founder Sergey Brin at SFO protest: ‘I am a refugee’ January 30, 2017       Share this Post Tweet           About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter GMSV     Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Apple hit with class-action lawsuit for allegedly… Google HR chief Laszlo Bock leaving to launch startup Twitter employees donate $1.59M to ACLU after Trump’s… Google eyes office drones for virtual… Uber faces more protests Thursday over CEO’s Trump…     Archives Archives Select Month February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2017 Bay Area News Group.

Residents of Raleigh, North Carolina who live in certain neighborhoods can now sign up to receive the 1Gbps internet service. The North Hills midtown area of Raleigh is the first neighborhood eligible for sign-ups for the service. Google Fiber starts at $50/month for 100Mbps speeds, or you can pay $70/month for speeds up to 1Gbps. You can also opt to receive TV service through Google Fiber which will bump those prices by an additional $90/month on both plans. While the rollout is only for this specific neighborhood in Raleigh, Google hopes to add the cities of Durham and Chapel Hill in the near future. Raleigh joins a long list of cities across the United States that have had the service rollout in neighborhoods, including Salt Lake City and Provo, Utah, Kansas City, Austin, Atlanta, and Charlotte.

Employees walked out and participated in a protest of Donald Trump's executive order which bans refugees from the seven Muslim-majority countries. The protestors gathered outside Google's California offices together with the company's chief executive, Sundar Pichai and co-founder Sergey Brin. In Google's Mountain View in California Headquarters, Pichai and Brin which are both immigrants spoke the crowd and voiced their concerns over Trump's order to ban travel to the US from the said countries. According to the Telegraph, there are more than 2,000 employees who joined the protest on the grounds of Google's campus against Trump's executive order. Most of them were carrying signs with messages like "We are a nation of immigrants," "All are welcome" and "No ban, no wall." Advertisement The executive order demands an "extreme vetting" of immigrants which according to Pichai affects almost 200 Google employees. "Some values are really near and dear to your heart, which is foundational and you should never compromise on. The thing we've been debating for the past three days is one of them," Pichai said. According to Mashable, upon the effectivity of Trump's order, Pichai started to email Google staff to inform them that the decision that the current president made affects at least 187 employees. Furthermore, Google created a $2 million crisis fund so that employees can match donations up to another $2 million. Monday's Google Doodle has also presented a commentary on Trump's decisions. Employees organized the protest on Monday. However, Google said that the company also supported the demonstrations. The hashtag #GooglersUnite and the #NoBanNoWall hashtag were used to protest on Trump's immigration policies. Aside from Google, many tech companies also criticized Trump's order. Google have even asked their employees overseas to return immediately to help with the logistics and handle the costs. Google which had close ties to the Obama Administration is currently determining its broader policy approach to Donald Trump's on a myriad issue which includes taxes, competition law, and net neutrality.

Dan Goodin - Feb 2, 2017 7:12 pm UTC Enlarge Alex Eylar reader comments 52 Share this story OAKLAND, Calif.—In September, KrebsOnSecurity—arguably the Internet's most intrepid source of security news—was on the receiving end of some of the biggest distributed denial-of-service attacks ever recorded. The site soon went dark after Akamai said it would no longer provide the site with free protection, and no other DDoS mitigation services came forward to volunteer their services. A Google-operated service called Project Shield ultimately brought KrebsOnSecurity back online and has been protecting the site ever since. At the Enigma security conference on Wednesday, a Google security engineer described some of the behind-the-scenes events that occurred shortly after Krebs asked the service for help, and in the months since, they said yes. While there was never significant hesitancy to bring him in, the engineers did what engineers always do—weighed the risks against the benefits. "What happens if this botnet actually takes down google.com and we lose all of our revenue?" Google Security Reliability Engineer Damian Menscher recalls people asking. "But we considered [that] if the botnet can take us down, we're probably already at risk anyway. There's nothing stopping them from attacking us at any time. So we really had nothing to lose here." Further ReadingWhy the silencing of KrebsOnSecurity opens a troubling chapter for the ‘NetIt took only about an hour for Menscher's team to arrive at the decision to help Krebs. A much more lengthy process involved actually admitting KrebsOnSecurity into Project Shield, a free service with the mission of protecting news-, journalist-, human rights-, and elections-monitoring sites from DDoS attacks that might otherwise prevent them from publishing. A key requirement for admittance is that the person requesting service proves they have control over the site. Because KrebsOnSecurity was down at that moment, Krebs was unable to satisfy this requirement. Making matters worse, the domain-name system settings KrebsOnSecurity used had been locked to thwart the attempted domain hijacking attacks that regularly targeted the site. That prevented Krebs from showing he had control of the site's DNS settings. Once Project Shield ultimately got KrebsOnSecurity back online, it took just 14 minutes for the attacks to resume. The first one came in the form of a flood of 130 million syn packets per second, a volume that's big enough to bring down plenty of sites, but a tiny drop when measured against the resources Google has. About a minute later, the attack shifted to a slightly more powerful flood of about 250,000 HTTP queries per second. It came from about 145,000 different IP addresses, making it clear that Mirai, an open-source botnet app that enslaves cameras and other Internet-of-things devices, was responsible. The attackers followed it with yet more variations, including a 140 gigabit-per-second attack made possible through a technique known as DNS amplification and a 4 million packet per-second syn-ack flood. Enlarge / An image accompanying Menscher's talk. Google At the four-hour mark, KrebsOnSecurity experienced one of the bigger attacks seen by Project Shield engineers. It delivered more than 450,000 queries per second from about 175,000 different IP addresses. Like the attacks that preceded it, it posed no immediate threat to KrebsOnSecurity or the Google resources that were protecting it. The attacks were the most powerful in the first two weeks, but as they continued, they incorporated a variety of new techniques. One, dubbed a WordPress pingback attack, abused a feature in the widely used blogging platform that automates the process of two sites linking to each other. It caused a large number of servers to simultaneously fetch KrebsOnSecurity content in an attempt to overwhelm site resources. Google was able to block it, because each querying machine broadcast a user agent that contained the words "WordPress pingback," which Google engineers promptly blocked. Another technique dubbed "cache-busting attacks" was also stopped. The DDoS attacks on KrebsOnSecurity remain a regular occurrence even today, and while some have resulted in brief interruptions so far none have caused sustained outages. Menscher shared the following lessons with the audience, which was made up largely of security-related engineers, technologists, and researchers: Defending a small site is really hard. All of my experience at Google for years was defending a very large site. If we had an extra thousand queries going through to one of our services, it wasn't a big deal. But Brian's origin server could maybe handle around 20 queries per second. We saw attacks of up to 450,000 queries per second. How do you deal with that? It's a little bit challenging. One thing you can do is you can rate limit the bad traffic. So you have to identify the bad traffic and try to throttle that down. Another thing that helps a lot is you can serve good traffic from cache. This takes a lot of load off the origin server. It also gives you this benefit of even if the origin server is unhealthy, you still have its content cached so you can continue to serve users and there isn't really a visible outage. Asked why a sprawling service such as Google is able to defend Krebs for free when officials at Prolexic—an Akamai-owned service with a core competency in DDoS mitigation—reportedly said it was no longer viable to continue its pro-bono arrangement, Menscher said: There's a lot to be said for economy of scale. In Google's case, we're already serving a lot of properties. By having all of that, it's more cost effective for us to have a terabit of spare capacity. I would expect Prolexic would also want to have a terabit of spare capacity, but then it starts eating into their spare capacity if... there are two dos attacks coming at the same time. The ultimate takeaway, Menscher said, is that even at a company like Google where it's crucial to have no more than five minutes of downtime in a given year, it's sometimes necessary to take risks. "I was trained as a physicist, and in physics we're always trying to figure out how the world works," he explained. "But you have to ask the right questions. You have to investigate things. You always have to be willing to question your assumptions. DDoS defense is very similar. You can't just look at the attacks you're getting. You have to be more proactive and try to attract more attacks and take some risks."

Companies spend nearly $100 billion on securing computers each year, yet incidents such as ransomware crippling hospitals and personal data leaking online remain common.

Two Infants Treated with Universal Immune Cells Have Their Cancer Vanish Boston Dynamics Has a New “Nightmare-Inducing” Robot “Security professionals need to worry not only about attackers but the neurobiology of their users,” said Vance, an associate professor at Brigham Young University, this week at the Enigma security conference in Oakland, California. His lab uses functional MRI scans of people’s brains to reveal the unconscious mechanisms behind the way they perceive—or ignore—security warnings. One of Vance’s studies led him to collaborate with Google on tests of a new approach to displaying security warnings in the Chrome Web browser that people were less likely to dismiss offhand. Vance says Google's engineers told him they plan to add the feature to an upcoming version of Chrome. Google did not respond to a request for confirmation of when it would be added. Daniela Olivera, an associate professor at the University of Florida, says such research can help suggest ways to refine the usability of security tools and features—an area many researchers say the industry has tended to overlook. Incidents ranging from common malware infections to high-profile breaches like the DNC one that exposed John Podesta’s e-mails often involve a person making a hasty decision about a warning message or strange e-mail. Multitasking is partly to blame. Vance’s collaboration with Google grew out of experiments that showed when people reacted to security warnings while also performing another task, brain activity in areas associated with fully engaging with a warning was significantly reduced. People were three times less likely to correctly interpret a message when they reacted to security warnings while also performing another task. Vance’s lab teamed up with Google to test a version of Chrome modified to deliver warnings about a person’s computer possibly being infected by malware or adware only when they weren’t deeply engaged in something. For example, it would wait until someone finished watching a video, or was waiting for a file to download or upload, to pop up the message. Brain scans reveal that we’re far more likely to ignore security warnings when we’re engaged in another task. Testing showed that people using the interruption-sensitive version of Chrome ignored the message only about a third of the time, compared to about 80 percent of the time without it. Other studies in Vance’s lab have shown that people very rapidly become habituated to security warnings—he’s shown how the brain’s response to a message drops significantly even on just the second time someone sees it. The researchers also did follow-up experiments in which people were asked to download mobile apps that asked for alarming permissions (for example, “Can delete your photos”). By breaking the usual rules of software design and having the security-related messages change in appearance slightly each time—for example, with different colors—it was possible to reduce the habituation effect. “This shows the potential to use neuroscience to understand people’s behavior and validate new user interface designs,” said Vance. “Our security UI should be designed to be compatible with the way our brains work.” Tagged Google, Chrome, computer security, online security Credit Images courtesy of Department of Psychology & Neuroscience Center at Brigham Young University Tom Simonite San Francisco Bureau Chief I’m MIT Technology Review’s San Francisco bureau chief and enjoy a diverse diet of algorithms, Internet, and human-computer interaction with chips on the side.

Screen Rant You Are Reading: 15 Worst Horror Movie Cliches That Just Keep Being Used Share On Facebook Comments (12) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next 63 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment 15 Worst Horror Movie Cliches That Just Keep Being Used By Mike McGranaghan 15 hours ago 12 Comments 63 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment When done right, horror is one of the most exhilarating, and even artistic, cinematic genres around. Rosemary’s Baby, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Shining, The Babadook — these are just a few of the universally acclaimed horror movies out there. They never get old, and they never lose their impact. A great fright flick has originality, style, three-dimensional characters, and a story that you can really get caught up in. That’s a potent mixture. Bad horror movies, on the other hand, rely on cliches. If we’re being honest, good horror movies oftentimes incorporate them as well. Cliches can be found in any genre, of course, but horror seems particularly susceptible to them. If you see a lot of horror movies, you’ve undoubtedly noticed a bunch of them popping up again and again. (And again and again.) You probably get tired of seeing them. We do, too. That’s why we’re here to point out some of the most prevalent and tiresome cliches out there. These tired genre standards have been done so many times that it’s positively baffling that anybody still uses them. Here are the 15 Worst Horror Movie Cliches That Just Keep Being Used. 15. Movie Google Horror movies often strive to incorporate modern technology. We’ve seen fright flicks based around cell phones, computers, home video, and other present-day conveniences. Sometimes, this sort of thing is effective, helping to bring horror into the 21st century. Other times, it can come off as silly. One of the more frequently-used technology-based cliches involves the internet, specifically Google (or a generic version thereof, because the search juggernaut wanted no part in the film). You’ve seen this many times. The characters discover something creepy going on. Maybe there’s a killer of some sort on the loose, or perhaps they’re looking into why paranormal events are occurring at a specific location. What do they do? Conduct a Google search, of course! Naturally, the popular search engine provides them with all the information they need in mere seconds. While it’s true that info is literally right at our fingertips these days, “movie Google” feels like a convenient way to cut corners in advancing the plot or providing exposition. Some of the recent movies where this cliche has come into play are The Darkness and Unfriended. 14. Mental institutions and orphanages If you’re making a list of inherently spooky settings, you may find that there aren’t a whole lot of options. A good writer and/or director can theoretically make any location scary. Still, there’s a challenge involved in turning, say, a daycare center into a place audiences will tremble at. Consequently, the few settings that are eerie in and of themselves tend to get used repeatedly onscreen. Two of the most popular of them are mental institutions and abandoned orphanages. They are often old and decrepit, and generally made of cold, uninviting brick. Mental institutions in movies almost always have that room in the basement where outdated psychiatric procedures — think shock treatment or trephining (the act of drilling a hole into someone’s skull) — once took place. Orphanages, meanwhile, typically house the spirits of children who were abused there. The appropriately titled The Orphanage and The Devil’s Backbone are just two horror films set in orphanages, while the list of notables set in mental institutions include Shutter Island, Session 9, The Ward, Gothika, and Stonehearst Asylum. There are many more. So many, in fact, that the locations are starting to lose some of their effectiveness. Audiences have simple grown a bit tired of seeing them recycled so often. 13. Falling female protagonists For reasons that are, depending on your perspective, either misogynist, psychosomatic, or both, women are the most frequent targets in horror movies. They’re constantly in grave danger. On the bright side, a number of recent fright flicks have at least made them strong and resourceful. Don’t Breathe and Lights Out are good examples. Still, the “damsel in distress” idea has become part and parcel of the genre. Even the shrewdest, most fierce female protagonists have a way of succumbing to a horror cliche that’s practically as old as horror itself: falling down. You know the drill. The woman is being chased by the killer, monster, or creature. For some reason, this often happens in the woods, although such clumsiness can really happen anywhere. She’s running to get away (which she should have no problem doing, since serial killers aren’t often known for their extensive cardio regime) when suddenly, she trips and falls. This allows her pursuer to catch up a little bit, theoretically heightening the tension. That may have been true at one point, but the gimmick has been used so many times over the decades that now, whenever we see a woman fall, we’re more likely to think “Not again!” than we are to experience any sort of fear for the character. 12. Generic paranormal activity Horror is very cyclical. A movie comes out and is a big hit, then a whole bunch of other horror movies try to do the exact same thing. For example, after the success of The Ring, Asian-inspired horror was all the rage. Then Saw hit, and “torture porn” became the big thing. These days, paranormal chillers are where it’s at, thanks to the massive success of both Paranormal Activity and The Conjuring. A good old ghost story is always welcome, but we wish those pesky poltergeists would find a new bag of tricks. In films ranging from Annabelle to the Insidious franchise to the indie hit We Are Still Here, spirits from the Great Beyond always tend to use the exact same means of frightening their victims. They slam doors, make lights flicker on and off, abruptly move furniture, create static on TV screens, and so on. That last one is especially weak, since static isn’t really even a thing anymore, thanks to cable television. We have to say, movie ghosts have become wildly unimaginative. If they want to up their game, they’re going to need to get some new material. 11. The cat scare Cats. They’re cute. They’re cuddly. There’s nothing scary about them, right? Unless they pop up in a horror movie, that is. One of the oldest, creakiest cliches is something known as the “cat scare.” This involves a main character walking around the house or yard to investigate a weird noise. You think that maybe there’s someone there, ready to jump out with a butcher knife or some other stabby weapon. Everything gets quiet, and then a cat leaps out, scaring the you-know-what out of the person, and possibly the audience. No killer, just a cat! The late film critic Roger Ebert used to call these felines “spring-loaded cats” because of the way they always seem to enter a scene airborne. Jones the cat scares Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) in Alien. A security guard is startled by one of these kitties while patrolling the grounds of a hospital in Halloween II. A woman in a car jumps when one runs across the hood in Darkness Falls. Demon Knight, When a Stranger Calls, Drag Me to Hell, and Friday the 13th: Part 2 also use some variation of the cat scare. (The recent Shut In substituted a raccoon for a cat, for what it’s worth). There are so many littered (no pun intended) across the horror movie landscape that we’re leaving out a few dozen additional examples. You can doubtlessly think of a few more, but we think you’d have a harder time coming up with an example that actually frightened you. 10. Shower scenes In 1960’s Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock pulled off one of the most shocking sequences in movie history. The film’s lead, Janet Leigh, steps into the shower. As she washes herself off, we see a shadow on the other side of the curtain. A hand abruptly flings the curtain aside, and a knife-wielding maniac begins mercilessly stabbing her to death. The scene ends with a shot of blood swirling down the drain. The sequence is shocking for two major reasons. First, it was incredibly graphic for its time (even though you hear more than you actually see). Second, no one expected the lead actress to die so soon into the movie. Since that time, a lot of films have included shower scenes. When you take a shower, you’re naked and vulnerable, so it’s kind of a natural attack zone in horror. Last year’s The Forest has a fake-scare version of the Psycho scene, featuring Natalie Dormer showering obliviously as a man approaches her fogged-up shower door. The Evil Dead remake has a female character getting scalded by a shower that inexplicably starts pumping out boiling water. In The Grudge, Sarah Michelle Gellar is washing her hair when a pair of fingers start protruding from the back of her head. Quite frankly, the shower is losing its impact. As soon as someone steps into one, you just sit and wait for something freaky to happen. There’s no surprise anymore. 9. The cell phone excuse Cell phones have made it tough on horror movies. In the old days — which is to say pre-1995 — characters could be stranded in the middle of nowhere and there was a vital sense of helplessness. Plunk them down in some remote location and they were stuck. There was no way to get help once the story’s villain started pursuing them. These days, all someone in that situation would have to do would be to use their cell phone to call or text for help. For this reason, lots of modern horror stories have to stop and find some kind of explanation for why they can’t do this. Oftentimes, this is accomplished via a throwaway line about how “my cell phone doesn’t get a signal out here.” By establishing this early on, the films are trying to remove a serious inconvenience to the plot. The problem is, cell phones have made life so much easier that way too many horror films now have to get them out of the way just to tell their story. This has become such a prominent cliche that The Cabin in the Woods played it for laughs. We recommend that some variations be put on this trope, like having a character who (gasp!) doesn’t own one. Or a young person who got his or hers taken away by Mom and Dad. That would at least put a slightly different spin on the trope. 8. Creepy kids Children are sweet and innocent, and horror movies love to subvert them. The trend of creepy kids goes back at least to 1960’s Village of the Damned, which featured a gang of blonde-haired, dazed-looking children terrorizing an English village. Since then, they have made repeated appearances onscreen. Movies like The Exorcist and The Omen make particularly good use of them. And let’s not forget those twin girls in The Shining. Creepy kids remain a staple of the genre. They pop up with regularity, whether it’s the bloodthirsty girl from Let the Right One In, the deceased little boy Toshio from The Grudge, the psychotic adopted child in Orphan, or the possessed girl in Ouija: Origin of Evil who gets some nasty revenge on a school bully. Even when you don’t actually see children in a movie, their presence is often felt. More than a few horror flicks utilize kids chanting on the soundtrack. Although creepy kids are generally effective, they get used so frequently that they are starting to wear out their welcome. 7. Cheap jolts Good horror movies build tension and suspense, pulling you into the story so that the scares emerge organically. You jump or scream because you care about what’s going to happen; you’re invested. Bad horror movies, meanwhile, have to manufacture cheap jolts just to keep people from dozing off. One of the most ubiquitous ways of doing this is to have everything get very quiet, then have an abrupt loud noise blast out at the audience in digital surround sound. (See The Bye Bye Man, The Boy, or The Apparition for some clearcut examples.) This startles people. Poor filmmakers hope that the crowds will attribute their physical reaction to the movie being scary, as opposed to recognizing that it’s just the equivalent of jumping out and screaming “Boo!” at somebody. Another cheap jolt is the old “bathroom mirror” gag. A character opens the medicine cabinet, and when they close it, there’s someone standing right behind them, reflected in the mirror. Sometimes it’s the killer, other times a loved one that’s just popping in to provide a fake scare. Orphan, Rob Zombie’s Halloween II, What Lies Beneath, and The Unborn are among the movies that have hauled out this old chestnut. Cheap jolts are an overused measure of desperation, and honestly, they’re not fooling anybody these days. 6. Consulting with a paranormal expert Just as the activities of ghosts and demons have become a cliche, so has another paranormal chiller element. There is always a point at which the main characters turn to an outside expert for help in solving their problem. This cliche goes back to the original Poltergeist, where Zelda Rubinstein played Tangina, the expert who helps the Freeling family get little Carol Ann out of the TV set. The paranormal expert can come in many forms. It can be a professional ghost hunter (The Conjuring, Insidious), an occult bookstore owner (Annabelle), or a demonologist (Paranormal Activity). Many times, it is a Catholic priest. (For some unknown reason, clergy members of other religions are rarely asked to help in these matters. Presumably, this has to do with the inherently cinematic nature of Catholic rituals.) Whenever there’s trouble of a supernatural nature, you can bet good money that someone is eventually gonna call a ghostbuster. It’s all a bit “been there, done that” at this point. 5. “Kill me before I turn” Zombie fiction has enjoyed a massive spike in popularity over the last decade, thanks to a bunch of extremely well-made undead flicks, plus AMC’s ratings blockbuster The Walking Dead. The “rules” of such stories were largely established by George A. Romero’s 1968 Night of the Living Dead, and were later refined by its sequels. Consequently, many zombie stories play by the same handbook. The best ones find new twists or fresh ways of presenting the core elements. That said, we’re really tired of one particular scene that almost always makes its way into any undead drama. It entails a beloved character getting bitten and then begging a friend or family member to “kill me before I turn.” Sometimes, the hero/heroine simply does the killing without being asked, because they realize what’s coming is worse. The gimmick, used in Zack Snyder’s Dawn of the Dead remake, among many others, can certainly be emotional. We’ve seen it so many times, however, that its ability to generate an emotional response is rapidly dwindling. 4. Spooky attics and basements When you were a kid, were you afraid of your attic or basement? Attics are usually a lot of plywood and fiberglass insulation, while basements (unless finished off into a nice home theater or something) tend to be cinder block walls and cement floors. Or, if your house is older, they can be stone walls with dirt floors. Either way, they’re not places you necessarily want to hang around in for long periods of time — especially when the light are out. Relatable as they are, horror movies really need to stop having their characters go into them. If we had a dime for every fright flick that incorporated a dingy basement or attic, we’d be super rich. Besides, nothing good ever happens in these locations! Just ask the characters from The Blair Witch Project. Two of them got attacked by the witch in one! The Innkeepers, Stir of Echoes, Signs, The Conjuring, and Don’t Breathe have all had horrific events transpire in basements. Ethan Hawke, on the other hand, found some old home movies that opened up a Pandora’s box of supernatural destruction in Sinister. The lesson: basements and attics should be avoided at all costs! 3. People scrawling on walls Delusions, hallucinations, and possessions may not be common occurrences in the real world (thank goodness) but they’re a part of everyday life in the world of cinematic horror. One of the surest signs that something freaky is going on is seeing somebody start to act in inexplicably strange ways. Since this is a mental process more than anything, filmmakers have to find a manner in which to visualize it. And the most common method they use is to have the afflicted characters obsessively scrawl nonsense all over walls or in notebooks. In The Bye Bye Man, a person scribbles in a book and inside the drawer of an end table. In The Number 23, Jim Carrey fills walls with mathematics and assorted bizarre ramblings. Patricia Arquette prefers doodling ancient religious symbols and words from dead languages in Stigmata. There are plenty more examples. Somewhere along the way, a clever screenwriter conceived such scrawling as a way to convey mental disturbance. Others seem to have simply copied and pasted the idea since then, leading to one of the most overused cliches in all of horror. 2. Found footage Found footage is not just a cliche, it’s a cliche made up of many little cliches. You’ve got the whole phony-baloney pretense that the movie is real, often achieved through on-screen text telling you who “found” the footage you’re about to see and that the people in it have disappeared. You’ve got the part where the characters come up with some lame justification for why they leave their camera on all the time. And found footage movies all seem to devolve, at some point, into a shaky-cam mess when someone runs in terror with the camera in tow. This renders you unable to discern what you’re looking it. It also tends to involve characters screaming tried and true lines like “Oh my God, what the hell is that?!” To be sure, there have been some very good found footage movies, with the original Paranormal Activity, Cloverfield, and The Blair Witch Project among them. There have been way more terrible ones, though. Just remember Apollo 18, The Devil Inside, The Gallows, Devil’s Due, and As Above, So Below. (Toss in the later Paranormal Activity sequels while you’re at it.) In those and others, you can really tell how played-out the whole found footage concept is, because the films all feel exactly the same. Enough already! 1. “Based on actual events” In 1979, The Amityville Horror became a box office hit, thanks in part to the idea that it was a cinematic retelling of a true story. Was a family really chased out of their home because of malevolent spirits? Well, they certainly claimed they were, and a best-selling book perpetuated that idea. The possibility that the terrifying events depicted might have actually happened was enough to propel the movie to an $86 million haul. (That’s $297 million in today’s dollars.) In the last ten or so years, filmmakers have borrowed the Amityville concept. The words “based on actual events” or “inspired by true events” appear on at least one or two horror movies per year. Sometimes there’s a basis for this. The Conjuring films, for instance, are based on real people — Ed and Lorraine Warren — and real cases they investigated. Other times, the claim is pure nonsense. If there’s a grain of truth at all, it’s minuscule. The 2016 chiller The Forest, to cite an example, took place in a real Japanese location where people go to commit suicide, but everything else in the story was pure fiction. Other supposedly true (but not really) examples are The Rite, The Haunting in Connecticut, The Strangers, The Possession, and Annabelle. In each case, the link to reality is spurious at best. There’s simply no way the outlandish things that happen in these movies can be possible. We’re not buying this hokum anymore. — Which of these tired cliches annoys you most? What other horror movie standards are you sick of? Sound off in the comments.

USA focused on conferences (MoCo) what conferences, and what of Mozilla's goals does this line up with? Canada is more focused with developed stuff (MoFo) there is a lot of work being done between Mofo and Moco to align work, for example both are working on onboarding for new mozillians (pooling their work, setting goals). Goals don’t align ? again can you explain what the goals are, and why they don't aline (assuming you mean USA and Canada), second questions - do people identify as having goals related to their country of residence? Or their community (local) In community organizing, it’s better to organize with smaller scale (scalability and sustainable) +1 Communication with everyone How to communicate this to Mozilla? create verbiage to show that strengthen the countries separately is more productive Is there work/documentation somewhere that explains how we see those differences? If people are very spaced out - why do country lines matter (wanting to understand) Mozilla Canada may need their own leadership what is leadership in the context of this discussion? Do you think you can come up with a hypothesis as to why this split is important to do now? vrs maybe breaking down the possibilities and testing what works (what I think we should consider, and respects different organizing styles, and commitment etc) ? AND then making a decision? An initiative for North America An initiative for just USA An initiative for just Canada An an initiative for just local community Don't want burnout!

we are a bunch of islands,people have other jobs, wanted to build community ourselves but we need back up, 
India has l10n, they have localization as the glue, what is the NA glue? several people with great leadership but wanted different outcomes, every leader had a different outcome, allow people to break off

When Beyonce was pregnant with Blue Ivy, all sorts of conspiracy theories erupted, with some folks claiming that Beyonce wore a fake baby belly to preserve her famous figure while having a secret surrogate carry her baby. Well, this time, Beyonce has broken all kinds of records with her initial pregnancy announcement that Beyonce is carrying twins. As seen in the below follow-up photos from Beyonce’s new photoshoot, Beyonce uses her hand and her hair to cover her naked body while she bares her nude baby bump for all the world to see. Beyoncé Shows Off Growing Baby Bump In This Epic Pregnancy Photoshoot #Queen https://t.co/4N0T1pbunZ pic.twitter.com/xBOtQIbRjn — Trendolizer (@Trendolizer) February 2, 2017 As reported by TMZ, Beyonce’s naked photoshoot — which features Beyonce underwater in some photos and with Blue kissing her naked belly in other photos — should shut up all the folks wondering if Beyonce’s pregnancy is really real. In fact, those are some of the searches that Google Trends reports came into their search engine on Wednesday, February 1, when Beyonce announced her pregnancy news. According to Google, Beyonce’s pregnancy announcement prompted two million searches to come into the search engine — with many folks typing “Beyonce pregnant 2017” and “Beyonce twins” into Google en masse. Along with news about Beyonce being pregnant, folks also searched for news about Jay-Z, Blue Ivy, and looked for Beyonce’s initial Instagram photo, which became the most-liked Instagram photo to date, reports CNET. Beyoncé is a true lover of art. This is art. Beyoncé is art. One more time, art. pic.twitter.com/xAjmNAKYFk — Bey (@braxattacks) February 2, 2017 As if it Beyonce’s pregnancy news wasn’t sinking in, other people asked Google, “Is Beyonce pregnant 2017?” and “Is Beyonce having twins?” Beyonce’s pregnancy announcement already came enough as a shock, apparently, to some Beyonce fans who’ve waited five years for the pregnancy news that the fact that Beyonce is pregnant with twins sent some people overboard — while others searched for information about whether or not Beyonce used IVF to conceive her twins. Beyoncé’s underwater maternity photos 2017 pic.twitter.com/VxuoSvkgao — ㅤ (@eliesaaab) February 2, 2017 Beyonce’s underwater photos aren’t nude — but the singer wore a yellow ensemble to cover her naked and growing baby bump. On Twitter and other social media platforms, photos of Beyonce’s nude baby bump — the pregnancy where Beyonce is carrying twins, along with Beyonce’s photos of her naked belly, pregnant with Blue — are making the rounds. "Beyoncé never carried Blue" these new receipts say otherwise pic.twitter.com/4XdcSw7CPd — batty boi brazzy (@brxdthomas) February 2, 2017 Some of the feedback over Beyonce’s new pregnancy photos can be read below. Certain individuals are likening Beyonce’s photoshoot to ancient paintings, and dubbing Beyonce’s new pregnancy a blessed event. All of Beyonce’s photos can be seen on her website, Beyonce.com, which includes photos of Beyonce’s mom, Tina Knowles, when she was pregnant with Beyonce. In the sand in front of Tina, viewers can see the names Beyonce, Tina, and Matt. Beyonce even has a photo of her grandmother holding Beyonce’s mom when Tina was herself a little baby. Other photos include pics of all the years that Beyonce and Jay-Z celebrated various events throughout their lives, including their wedding day, their honeymoon, Jay’s 40th birthday and more. Demetrius Harmon: “Beyonce gone have 3 kids….. destiny’s child.” Lio:‏ “If Beyoncè has twin girls, I hope the two of them form an R&B group w Blue Ivy and call it Destiny’s Granchildren.” M.: “Beyoncé’s underwater maternity photoshoot is giving me LIFE. These are unreal.” Issa Owl: “Beyoncé straight showed us all Goddess personified during a time of paternalistic, toxic and oppressive so-called ‘power.'” Kathi CP: “There are more black people growing inside of Beyonce than in the entire current administration.” [Featured Image by Sang Tan/AP Images] Now Watch This: Justin Bieber Features Dance Moves In Super Bowl Ad Now Read This: Beyonce Shows Off Her Naked Pregnancy Bump Share 2 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Paula Mooney Tags: Beyonce's New Pregnancy Photos: View All 2017 Baby Bump Pictures On Beyonce.com February 2, 2017 Heather Dubrow Reportedly Seeking Her Own Show On E!

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains why. Buzz60 Apple has been replaced by Google as the most valuable company in the world, according to a new report from Brand Finance. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) Apple, the most valuable brand in the world for the past five years, has yielded the top spot to Google, according to a new report. The iPhone maker's brand value has plummeted 27% to $107 billion since the start of last year, according to Brand Finance’s Global 500 2017 report. Google’s brand, however, is now worth $109 billion, making it the most lucrative in the world. It is the first time the search giant has topped the list since 2011. After Google and Apple are Amazon, AT&T and Microsoft. Google’s place as the dominant search engine safeguards its stream of advertising revenue, which increased 20% last year. The uptick occurred even though marketers are paying less for page views generated by those searching online. Apple, meanwhile, is losing its grip on some tech-crazed consumers. The Apple Watch has not been the moneymaker the company had hoped it would become. A company that was once renowned for its innovation is not signaling that it has another unique product coming anytime soon. And Apple’s list of competitors in the smartphone space is continuing to grow, the report says. This week, however, Apple showed that its signature iPhone still has the potential to be a profit machine, buoying investors. Robust sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus over the holidays led to the tech giant to just report it earned $17.9 billion, or $3.36 a share in the first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31. Though the net income was off 2.7% from $18.4 billion in the same quarter a year ago, revenue was a record-setting revenue of $78.4 billion. Apple beat analysts' profit expectations. Meanwhile, Google's parent company Alphabet reported reported net income of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share, for the fourth quarter. It missed analysts' estimates, though revenue soared 22% to $26 billion. The revenue growth was propelled by mobile search, video ads, and its expansion in newer business lines like cloud computing. While technology was dominant among the world's most valuable companies, the banking industry was next in having the most lucrative brands, followed by the telecom sector, retail and the car industry. 10202 CONNECTTWEET 73 LINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jZxv4a NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.

Now that appears to be changing if a new rumor is to be believed.   Was recently told that Assistant is finally coming to Nexus 5X/6P soon with next “major” update. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) February 2, 2017 Stephen Hall of 9to5Google tweeted the above, stating that he was informed that the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P will be getting Google Assistant with the next “major” update. That leaves a lot of questions open. Does that mean Nexus owners will have to wait until Android 7.2 to get their hands on Google Assistant? Either way, it looks like Google’s strategy is to rollout Google Assistant to a myriad of devices, as even the ill-fated Nexus Player is slated to receive the update for Android TV. Of course, if you don’t want to wait for the next “major” update to get Google Assistant enabled on your Nexus 5X or Nexus 6P, there’s a guide over on XDA Developers that will get you started.

The latest method of protest will reportedly come in the form of a letter sent directly to the President, in which Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Uber, and others write that “a blanket suspension is not the right approach.” Recode’s Kara Swisher was first to report on the formal letter, a response to the last week’s executive order that banned entry to the US for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen – for 90 days. It has also suspended the entire US refugee admissions system for 120 days and suspended the Syrian refugee program indefinitely. Recode has published a full draft of the letter, which you can read below. It mentions America being “the land of opportunity, – welcoming newcomers and giving them the chance to build families, careers, and businesses in the United States.” Not since Apple’s encryption battle with the FBI over the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone have so many Silicon Valley rivals been united against a cause. A huge number of CEO’s, including Google’s Sundar Pichai, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella have spoken out against the ban and pledged to support any employees that may be affected by it. Protests have been taking place across the country, and yesterday brought news of Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt’s warning that Trump’s administration will “do evil things as they’ve done in the immigration area.” Here’s the full draft of the letter: Dear President Trump, Since the country’s birth, America has been the land of opportunity – welcoming newcomers and giving them the chance to build families, careers, and businesses in the United States. We are a nation made stronger by immigrants. As entrepreneurs and business leaders, our ability to grow our companies and create jobs depends on the contributions of immigrants from all backgrounds. We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today’s security needs and keeps our country safe. We are concerned, however, that your recent executive order will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United States and contribute to our country’s success. In a global economy, it is critical that we continue to attract the best and brightest from around the world. We welcome the changes your administration has made in recent days in how the Department of Homeland Security will implement the executive order, and we stand ready to help your administration identify other opportunities to ensure that our employees can travel with predictability and without undue delay. Our nation’s compassion is a part of what makes it exceptional, and we are committed to helping your administration identify approaches for thorough screening without a blanket suspension of admissions under the U.S. Refugee Admissions program. While security and vetting procedures can and should always be subject to continuous evaluation and improvement, a blanket suspension is not the right approach. Similarly, we stand ready to identify ways of helping to achieve your stated goal of bringing clarity to the future of the 750,000 Dreamers in this country under the protections of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in a way “that will make people happy and proud.” Removing these protections by barring renewals would effectively end the program and eliminate the ability for these Dreamers to work and live without the fear of deportation. The business community shares your commitment to growing the American economy and expanding job creation across the country. We hire both thousands of Americans and some of the most talented people from abroad, who work together to help our companies succeed and expand our overall employment. As you contemplate changes to the nation’s complex and interconnected immigration policies, whether business and employment-based visas, refugees, or DACA, we hope that you will use us as a resource to help achieve immigration policies that both support the work of American businesses and reflect American values.

But who is it? P.B.S. Pinchback In 1872, P.B.S. Pinchback became the first American of African descent to serve as the governor of a U.S. state when he served briefly as governor of Louisiana. (Library of Congress) Print Email Mike Scott, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Mike Scott, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on February 02, 2017 at 12:37 PM, updated February 02, 2017 at 1:47 PM comments Here's a game: Quick, find a picture of Homer Plessy, the New Orleans man behind the landmark Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson, which gave legal cover to Jim Crow laws for more than 60 years. You have two minutes. Go. That wasn't so hard, was it? Google Images is a beautiful thing. There's only one problem: That picture of the dapper looking-gentleman with the pocket watch and impressive Rutherford B. Hayes beard isn't actually a picture of Homer Plessy at all. The Internet will tell you it's Homer Plessy at seemingly every turn. But the Internet, it lies. I discovered this recently when pulling together my story on the Plessy v. Ferguson case for The Times-Picayune's "300 for 300" project, a two-year stroll through history -- timed to coincide with the tricentennial of New Orleans -- highlighting the people and moments that made this crazy, fascinating city the place that it is. Shortly after I filed my story, one of our crackerjack page designers proffered a suggestion: We all know his name, but wouldn't it be nice if we could put a face to Homer Plessy? Is there a photo of him we can dig up and run? Great idea. I checked The Times-Picayune archives but with no luck. (Newspapers of a century ago didn't run photos nearly as often as they do today.) Then I checked the National Archives. Nothing. I checked the Library of Congress. Again, nothing. Finally, in an effort to find out if such a photo even existed, I turned to Google. Several websites, and even some resources maintained by educators, were indeed using a photo labeled Homer Plessy -- but it was the wrong photo. So, whose photo is it? Well, if you know your Louisiana history, you know it's an image of P.B.S. Pinchback, the state's 24th governor -- and a man who stakes his own noteworthy claim to history. As it turns out, there is no known photo of Plessy in existence, according to Phoebe Ferguson, the great-great-granddaughter of the Ferguson in the "Plessy v. Ferguson" case and the executive director of the Plessy and Ferguson Foundation. (She runs it with Keith Plessy, a descendant of Homer Plessy, to educate people on the case's impact.) "This proliferation of the P.B.S. Pinchback (photo) is an epidemic that won't go away no matter how we have tried," Ferguson wrote in an email exchange. "We are working on partnerships that we hope will help to quell and correct this unfortunate misinformation." It's unclear who first confused Pinchback for Plessy, but both men lived in New Orleans at roughly the same time, both were light-skinned black men and both were history makers. It's also worth noting that Pinchback was a member of the Comite des Citoyens, the New Orleans group that orchestrated Plessy's arrest in an effort to challenge the legality of segregation. But, Google be darned, they're two different people. "It is so unfortunate that scholars, researchers and historians aren't more aware of Lt. Gov. P.B.S. Pinchback's importance in African-American history and therefore would recognize his face for his own political accomplishments," Ferguson said. This being Black History Month, it's the perfect time to set the record straight. Meet P.B.S. Pinchback: Born in Georgia to a white plantation owner and an emancipated slave mother, Pinckney Benton Stewart Pinchback found himself supporting his family at the age of 12 after his father died, according to Harvard University historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. in an article on Pinchback posted to PBS.org. ("The white side of the family left the black side penniless and in fear of being re-enslaved," Gates writes.) The young Pinchback worked for a time as a ship steward on the Mississippi River, then fought on the Union side in the Civil War as part of the Second Louisiana Native Guard. "Once there, he eventually rose to captain before resigning over discriminatory promotional practices and unequal pay. After lobbying for black schools in Alabama, Pinchback returned to Louisiana in time for the state's 1868 constitutional convention (a pre-condition for rejoining the Union)," according to Gates. As a delegate to the convention, Pinchback pushed for the establishment of a college for black students -- leading to the creation of Southern University -- and eventually was elected to the state Senate. He was serving as president pro tem of that body when the state's lieutenant governor, Oliver Dunn, died in 1871. Pinchback took his place. A year later, Gov. Henry Clay Warmouth was impeached amid the fallout from a bitter election. That left Pinchback to step in once more, serving as governor for a little more than a month -- and in the process becoming the only black governor of any state during Reconstruction, and the first black governor in U.S. history. It wouldn't be until 1990 that another black man would serve as governor of any state, when Douglas Wilder was elected to Virginia's top seat. In addition to studying law at present-day Dillard University, Pinchback for a time published the Louisianan newspaper in New Orleans and served for a time as director of Orleans Parish public schools. He is buried in Metairie Cemetery -- which was reportedly previously reserved only for white burials. Although his political service isn't without its controversy (Gates points out he wasn't above using the political system to his own financial advantage), P.B.S. Pinchback boasts an undeniably impressive resume. But, once and for all, he is not Homer Plessy. ___________ Got a question about New Orleans' history or a great memory to share?

Visual search startup Clarifai beefs up its AI team with a new San Francisco office Posted 15 hours ago by Matthew Lynley (@mattlynley) 0 SHARES Next Story Snapchat reportedly hit 160M daily users and $400M revenue in 2016 Clarifai — a startup that gives companies and developers a way to implement visual search into their products — said today it was hiring former Google Brain developer Andrea Frome as the company’s new head of research. Frome received her Ph. D. from Berkeley and worked at Google for more than seven years — 3 years of which were working on street view figuring out how to blur out faces and license plates among other tasks. Frome then worked on the Google Brain team, which was applying deep learning to computer vision and search. So the problems that she had worked on clearly fit into the same bucket as the ones Clarifai is looking to solve. She will be based in San Francisco, where the company is opening a new office and starting to expand beyond their New York presence. “Going back to Google or a large company, there’s a lot of exciting things happening, but they’re packed their groups so full it feels like you’re always stepping on someone’s toes and trying to figure out your niche,” Frome said. “One thing that’s exciting about Clarifai, we’re trying focused efforts which I find very exciting as a researcher, it motivates the things I’m gonna pay attention to and focus on. Because it’s a small nimble company it’s possible to get our hands in lots of different spaces.” Related Articles Clarifai raises $30M to give developers visual search capabilities Pinterest begins rolling out search ads for keywords and shopping campaigns Pinterest has lowered its hiring goals for women in engineering roles SoundHound raises $75M to bring its voice-enabled AI everywhere Clarifai gives developers tools for tagging metadata to photos and enable the company to algorithmically learn what kinds of objects are in those photos. With that data, developers are able to train algorithms to search for those objects in photos or video or input their own content to search for objects. The company raised $30 million in October last year in a round led by Menlo Ventures, with Union Square Ventures, Lux Capital and others participating, and has raised a total of $41.25 million in financing. These are problems that larger companies like Pinterest and Google are working on, but for the time being those companies are keeping the tools in-house. Clarifai instead is trying to build a set of products that opens up the kinds of visual search tools those companies have to any startup or larger partner. Clarifai, too, is trying to be a neutral player — giving companies a set of tools they can use without feeling pressure that data is being shared with competitors or forcing companies to duct tape themselves to an experience powered by something like Google in order to have access to visual search. “Research is a really unique team at Clarifai, it’s differentiated on our organizational structure,” Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler said. “We have a structure that’s a grid — each row is a skill set. The columns are products. Research is not underneath any of those columns, it’s off the grid and to the right. The reason for that is we don’t want them tied to product and getting customer feedback and only driven by those KPIs. We want it to be much more long-term focus.” After a brief stint at a healthcare startup and working on the Hillary Clinton campaign she ended up at the top of a pile of photos in newsletter following a dinner event, grabbing Zeiler’s attention and prompting the start of the conversation. Zeiler and Frome briefly overlapped at Google during an internship. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Clarifai Founded 2013 Overview Clarifai provides advanced image recognition systems for customers to detect near-duplicates and visual searches.

London, United Kingdom, February 02, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Google Home, the voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant launched in the US on 4th November 2016. itcher, the entertainment recommendations app that promises new title suggestions in less than 50 seconds, were one of the few boutique brands to work with Google on this project. With itcher, Google Home users will be able to ask the Google Assistant to recommend them a movie hands-free, without needing to search on a computer or tablet. itcher does require every user to link to an itcher account before using their action in order to keep track of recommendations. In their collaboration with Google, itcher uses two categories: books and movies. Users can use commands such as: “Ok Google, talk to itcher” “Ok Google, tell itcher to recommend me a movie” “Ok Google, I want to talk to itcher about books” “Ok Google, ask itcher to suggest me a book” “Ok Google, let me talk to itcher about movies” itcher Co-Founder and CEO, Daniel Rovira, says the team was delighted when they found out about the collaboration. “When Google called us asking if we would like to participate in the early access programme for the Google Assistant on Google Home, we were so excited! This was an opportunity to work on some cutting edge technology in a close partnership with Google.” The integration with the Google Assistant on Google Home is the next step in the startup’s journey to become "the place for entertainment recommendations." The team highlight that itcher is "warmer" than just an algorithm. "To us, itcher is the rush you get when finding the perfect movie to watch, the new title of an author you adore catching your eye, the joy of flicking eagerly through endless record shelves, the wild excitement of watching the launch trailer of an upcoming game..." The machine-learning mobile application asks users to rate titles in any of their 5 categories - movies, TV shows, books, music and games - and generates community-powered recommendations based on what others with a similar taste have liked. It is the first platform to allow cross-category recommendations, meaning users may be recommended a book based on their tastes in other categories. itcher was created back in 2013 by William Cooper, Daniel Rovira and Richard Brindley. Cooper had previously co-founded Achica, the members-only luxury lifestyle store, back in 2010. Rovira, who is also CEO of itcher, formerly co-founded MadBid in 2008 and successfully built it to a $30m business. He previously worked in the Media and Technology team at Goldman Sachs in London. Richard Brindley, an experienced CTO, is responsible for everything from technical design to supporting the development team. Together they built the first recommendations app to introduce cross-category recommendations on a platform that also allows users to create lists and follow other users. Users who want to see more of itcher can also download the itcher app which includes the option to create lists and follow those with similar tastes.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google rolls out Associate Android Developer Certification program By John Hoff - February 2, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Associate Android Developer Certification program was announced at Google I/Co 2016, but it seems that it’s only now that the mothership is intentionally pushing it to the masses. Google is aiming that this official certification becomes the industry benchmark for Android development skills, and for good reason. Google is committed to the Android platform now, it should be the one to set the standards for it. What is the Associate Android Developer Certification program? It is, in its simplest form, a performance-based examination where developers will have their skills measured and certified by writing real apps. There’s a video below that explains the program some more. Don’t jump the gun and sign up for it if you don’t know what you’re getting into. This is NOT a training course where your skills will be honed. Rather, it is the exam you take once you feel that your Android developer skills are good enough that you want to be certified for it. Google has partnered with Udacity, if the training and learning part is what you are looking for. This certification program is for those of you who want to make sure your skills are up to par with the industry standards, and if you want to make sure that this part of your skill set is certified by Google so that you can put it on your official resume.

I'm going to assume you've checked out satellite photos of your house. Why wouldn't you, right? Depending where you live, the image resolution might be high enough for you to make out the car in your driveway. DigitalGlobe is one of the main purveyors of satellite photos, pictures taken with telescopes in orbit and beamed down from space. You can find its images on Google Maps and Google Earth, among others. The company's Instagram account shows incredible slices of the world. Its images also appear in other places including the super popular Daily Overview. The new WorldView-4 satellite, launched at the end of 2016, will give DigitalGlobe even more coverage. It'll also have the potential to deliver even more incredible images. Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how it works. 18 Giant camera in space: DigitalGlobe's WorldView-4 satellite and imagery As good as satellites are allowed to get Satellite photography isn't new. Basically since we starting lobbing stuff into orbit, people figured out how to take pictures from there. It wasn't until 1992 that it became legal for private companies to get into the satellite photo business. That's when WorldView Imaging Corporation was founded, which today is DigitalGlobe. As the technology improved and the regulations decreased, higher and higher resolutions were possible. Today the highest resolution available for consumer use is 31 centimeters per pixel. Higher resolutions are restricted to government satellites. If that's what we get to see, how much better do you think the government stuff is? Think they can identify faces or license plates from orbit yet? A photo posted by Daily Overview (@dailyoverview) on Nov 17, 2016 at 6:47am PST Not all the "satellite" photos you see online are actually, well, satellite photos. In some cases, they're high-resolution photographs taken from planes. So the really detailed stuff might not have been taken from space. Kind of a bummer, that, right? There are limits to aerial photography, though, hence the need for satellites. A view from the WorldView-4 Last November, DigitalGlobe's WorldView-4 satellite launched into orbit from Vandenberg AFB on top of an Atlas V rocket built by United Launch Alliance. It orbits at an average distance of 617 kilometers (383.4 miles), and completes its orbit roughly every 97 minutes. A photo posted by DigitalGlobe (@digitalglobe) on Dec 2, 2016 at 7:13am PST The WorldView-4 is about the size of a pickup truck standing on its nose and weighing roughly as much. It's 5.3 meters (17.7 foot) tall, 2.5 meters (8 foot) across. The solar arrays, when deployed, are 7.9 meters (26 foot) across. Inside is a telescope 1.1 meters (43.3 inches) wide with 3.2 terabytes of onboard storage. It tracks its position using the locations of the stars as well as the Global Positioning System (GPS), whose satellites are in a much higher orbit.

Its panchromatic (black and white) resolution is 31 centimeters (12.2 inches) per pixel, while the multispectral (or color) resolution is 124 centimeters (48.8 inches) per pixel in red, green, blue and near-infrared wavelengths. The higher resolution of black and white may seem odd, but this is actually similar to how your TV works. There is far more black-and-white detail than there is in color, because your eye can't see as much detail in color as it can with black and white. The WorldView-4 is similar to the WorldView-3 satellite, which is already in orbit. The 4 was actually built around the same time as the 3. But it was made for the GeoEye company, which DigitalGlobe bought in 2013. The 4 should have a lifespan of 10-12 years. Though raw satellites are undeniably cool, they aren't quite as awesome as they could be. A bit of work is sometimes required to clean them up a bit. DigitalGlobe processes the images using a method called Atmospheric Compensation to remove haze and thin clouds. Before and after DigitalGlobe's "AComp" processing. DigitalGlobe Beyond your back yard Sure it's cool to zoom in and look at your house, but of course there's more uses than just that. There are several Instagram accounts that find creative uses for DigitalGlobe imagery. One of my favorites is Daily Overview, which finds random parts of the world and gives you a bit of background about what's there. A photo posted by Daily Overview (@dailyoverview) on Jan 31, 2017 at 1:16pm PST DigitalGlobe sells or makes its images available to a variety of companies and governments for different uses. The AP used DigitalGlobe images to help track fish caught and processed by pirates and their slaves (no, seriously) and it also helped track the Fort McMurray wildfire, study remote human settlements and more. TomNod uses DigitalGlobe's images and crowdsourcing to count seals in Antarctica, map typhoon damage and even help try to find the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Because the company's image library goes back nearly 20 years, it can also help track the ceaseless worsening of climate change. All eyes on Earth In the past few years several companies have entered the satellite imagery arena, each with their own niche. Google's Terra Bella has 90-centimeter photo resolution and 1.1-meter HD video resolution. UrtheCast has video cameras on the ISS, and you can see a live feed right now. Then there's Planet Labs, which uses tiny CubeSats. Their resolution isn't as impressive, but there are over 90 in orbit so they offer incredible coverage. Here's a view of them deploying from the ISS. A satellite's eye view It's easy to take technology for granted. It's easy to click on Google Maps, take a look at where you are or where you're headed, and see a bird's eye view with lots of detail. But often it's not a bird's eye view at all. It's from a satellite hundreds of miles above that took a picture months or years ago. Then that photo was beamed down from space and sent to your phone wirelessly from a tower you can't even see. That's pretty cool. And if you want your own imaging satellite? It only cost $835 million to build, launch and insure the WorldView-4. Check your couch cushions. Got a question for Geoff?

Google last occupied the position of the world’s most valuable brand in 2011. The company remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, the mainstay of its advertising income. Ad revenues were up 20 percent in 2016 as budgets are increasingly directed online and Google finds more innovative ways to monetise users. David Haigh, CEO of Brand Finance, said: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage, with new iterations of the iPhone delivering diminishing returns, while the Chinese market is now crowded with local competitors. Apple has been living on borrowed time for several years by exploiting its accumulated brand equity. This underlines one of the many benefits of a strong brand, but Apple has finally taken it too far.” Every year, leading valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance values the brands of thousands of the world’s biggest companies. Brands are first evaluated to determine their power / strength (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation). Brand strength is used to determine what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand, which is projected into perpetuity to determine the brand’s value. The results of this analysis are ranked, with the world’s 500 most valuable brands featured in the Brand Finance Global 500. View the full list of the world’s 500 most valuable brands here Lego has regained its status as the world’s most powerful brand. The building blocks for Lego’s brand strength have always been present but the release of the Lego Movie in 2014 provided the final push required to make Lego the world’s most powerful brand in 2015. The first sequel, the Lego Batman Movie will be released on February 9th. Its predicted impact has helped Lego regain its top position, lost to Disney in 2016. Further planned releases will continue to build the brand for years to come, while contributing significantly to Lego’s already vast licensing income. David Haigh adds: “Unvalued brands can lead to undervalued companies that are more vulnerable to takeover, struggle to secure adequate financing and miss market opportunities. Meanwhile a powerful brand can protect a company’s value during turbulent market conditions, create new market opportunities and increase profit margins. All companies should therefore not just know the value of their brands, but also understand what drives that value and how it can be harnessed to benefit the business as a whole.” You can find more detailed insights into brands from industries such as TMT, Oil & Gas, Tech, FMCG, Banking, Fashion, and Aviation in the Brand Finance Global 500 2017 Report, highlights include: ⦁ China’s bank brands are now worth more than those of the United States ⦁ ICBC is the world’s most valuable banking brand ⦁ AT&T has overtaken Verizon to become the world’s most valuable telecoms brand ⦁ Emirates is no longer the most valuable airline brand, having been overtaken by American, United & Delta ⦁ Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonalds, KFC & Subway all see brand values fall, undermined by healthy eating trends ⦁ Nokia’s brand is back from the brink and back in the top 500, following takeover and rebrand of Alcatel and launch of the Nokia 6 phone Read the full report on the world’s 500 most valuable brands here Brand Finance is a leading brand valuation and strategy consultancy, with offices in over 15 countries. We provide clarity to marketers, brand owners and investors by quantifying the financial value of brands. Drawing on expertise in strategy, branding, market research, visual identity, finance, tax and intellectual property, Brand Finance helps clients make the right decisions to maximize brand and business value and bridges the gap between marketing and finance. Methodology Definition of Brand When looking at brands as business assets that can be bought, sold and licensed, a technical definition is required. Brand Finance helped to craft the internationally recognized standard on Brand Valuation, ISO 10668. That defines a brand as “a marketing-related intangible asset including, but not limited to, names, terms, signs, symbols, logos and designs, or a combination of these, intended to identify goods, services or entities, or a combination of these, creating distinctive images and associations in the minds of stakeholders, thereby generating economic benefits/value.” However, a brand makes a contribution to a company beyond that which can be sold to a third party. ‘Brand Contribution’ refers to the total economic benefit that a business derives from its brand, from volume and price premiums over generic products to cost savings over less well-branded competitors. Brand Strength Brand Strength is the part of our analysis most directly and easily influenced by those responsible for marketing and brand management. In order to determine the strength of a brand we have developed the Brand Strength Index (BSI). We analyse marketing investment, brand equity (the goodwill accumulated with customers, staff and other stakeholders) and finally the impact of those on business performance. Following this analysis, each brand is assigned a BSI score out of 100, which is fed into the brand value calculation. Based on the score, each brand in the league table is assigned a rating between AAA+ and D in a format similar to a credit rating. AAA+ brands are exceptionally strong and well managed while a failing brand would be assigned a D grade. Approach Brand Finance calculates the values of the brands in its league tables using the ‘Royalty Relief approach’. This approach involves estimating the likely future sales that are attributable to a brand and calculating a royalty rate that would be charged for the use of the brand, i.e. what the owner would have to pay for the use of the brand—assuming it were not already owned. The steps in this process are as follows: 1 Calculate brand strength on a scale of 0 to 100 based on a number of attributes such as emotional connection, financial performance and sustainability, among others. This score is known as the Brand Strength Index, and is calculated using brand data from the BrandAsset® Valuator database, the world’s largest database of brands, which measures brand equity, consideration and emotional imagery attributes to assess brand personality in a category agnostic manner. 2 Determine the royalty rate range for the respective brand sectors. This is done by reviewing comparable licensing agreements sourced from Brand Finance’s extensive database of license agreements and other online databases. 3 Calculate royalty rate. The brand strength score is applied to the royalty rate range to arrive at a royalty rate. For example, if the royalty rate range in a brand’s sector is 0-5 percent and a brand has a brand strength score of 80 out of 100, then an appropriate royalty rate for the use of this brand in the given sector will be 4 percent. 4 Determine brand specific revenues estimating a proportion of parent company revenues attributable to a specific brand. 5 Determine forecast brand specific revenues using a function of historic revenues, equity analyst forecasts and economic growth rates. 6 Apply the royalty rate to the forecast revenues to derive brand revenues. 7 Brand revenues are discounted post tax to a net present value which equals the brand value.

Yard Sales Want to know where the yard/garage sales are this week? (read more) By Jason E. Marcin, Newspaper In Education student columnist / Published: February 1, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     JasonMarcin Knightly News “We are halfway there!” is the rallying cry frequently heard in the halls of Lake-Lehman Jr./Sr. High School around this time of year. The first half of the educational year has expired, and as the Black Knights head into the third marking quarter, changes abound. Schedules shift, with several brand new Language Arts electives taking hold in the curriculum for current juniors and seniors. Now, rather than having a single language arts class all year long, students take half a year of American Literature (juniors), or half a year of British Literature (for seniors). After these classes are completed, students have the option of selecting a Language Arts class (or two) of their choosing for the second half of the school year. Some viable options include Unraveling Childhood Literature, Shakespeare, Mythology, and Journalism. In addition to revolutionizing the curriculum, Lake-Lehman has also taken gigantic strides in terms of technology. Every single student at the junior/senior high school has been issued a Google Chromebook, his/her very own laptop to help streamline their educational process. The school has also invested in many Google programs, such as Google Classroom, which allows teachers to post assignments, receive submissions, and grade them all virtually online. Gone are the days of submitting printed or handwritten essays or lab reports; now these documents are typed in Google Docs and submitted paperfree via the virtual classroom. While technology always comes with a share of issues, the faculty and staff at Lake-Lehman have been handling these changes and arising problems quite well. Furthermore, to the surprise of many students, as this article was being written, a new website was announced and activated. Now located at www.llsd.org, the Lake-Lehman School District homepage has been recreated and refined to a far better page than previously existed, making life much easier for any wishing to utilize it. Teachers are adapting well to the technology they now have at their disposal, and their deep dedication to the students has never faded. One of the best things about Lake-Lehman is surely the teachers. The teachers at this school genuinely care about the students they teach, often willing to sacrifice their own time after school to help tutor struggling students or spend a little extra time on certain topics. The staff works earnestly to help prepare students for the next steps in their lives, whether it be the next grade level, or college. Like any school, Lake-Lehman has its faults and areas where improvements can still be made, but the efforts shown as of late are truly demonstrative of the level of interest and care given by the district and administrators to the students. People here value the students of the district, and work very hard to help them succeed and thrive in a positive learning environment. Times are changing rapidly and the new digital age moving forward presents a massive challenge to the educational community, but it also presents many opportunities. Lake-Lehman is clearly facing the technological trifles head on, and taking full advantage of the boundless, wondrous opportunities present in order to help their students thrive. Jason Marcin is a junior at Lake-Lehman High School. Student columns are published Wednesdays during the school year.

Companies spend nearly $100 billion on securing computers each year, yet incidents such as ransomware crippling hospitals and personal data leaking online remain common. Anthony Vance thinks that defensive measures could be more effective if we paid more attention to the hardware between our ears.

Two Infants Treated with Universal Immune Cells Have Their Cancer Vanish Boston Dynamics Has a New “Nightmare-Inducing” Robot “Security professionals need to worry not only about attackers but the neurobiology of their users,” said Vance, an associate professor at Brigham Young University, this week at the Enigma security conference in Oakland, California. His lab uses functional MRI scans of people’s brains to reveal the unconscious mechanisms behind the way they perceive—or ignore—security warnings. One of Vance’s studies led him to collaborate with Google on tests of a new approach to displaying security warnings in the Chrome Web browser that people were less likely to dismiss offhand. Vance says Google's engineers told him they plan to add the feature to an upcoming version of Chrome. Google did not respond to a request for confirmation of when it would be added. Daniela Olivera, an associate professor at the University of Florida, says such research can help suggest ways to refine the usability of security tools and features—an area many researchers say the industry has tended to overlook. Incidents ranging from common malware infections to high-profile breaches like the DNC one that exposed John Podesta’s e-mails often involve a person making a hasty decision about a warning message or strange e-mail. Multitasking is partly to blame. Vance’s collaboration with Google grew out of experiments that showed when people reacted to security warnings while also performing another task, brain activity in areas associated with fully engaging with a warning was significantly reduced. People were three times less likely to correctly interpret a message when they reacted to security warnings while also performing another task. Vance’s lab teamed up with Google to test a version of Chrome modified to deliver warnings about a person’s computer possibly being infected by malware or adware only when they weren’t deeply engaged in something. For example, it would wait until someone finished watching a video, or was waiting for a file to download or upload, to pop up the message. Brain scans reveal that we’re far more likely to ignore security warnings when we’re engaged in another task. Testing showed that people using the interruption-sensitive version of Chrome ignored the message only about a third of the time, compared to about 80 percent of the time without it. Other studies in Vance’s lab have shown that people very rapidly become habituated to security warnings—he’s shown how the brain’s response to a message drops significantly even on just the second time someone sees it. The researchers also did follow-up experiments in which people were asked to download mobile apps that asked for alarming permissions (for example, “Can delete your photos”). By breaking the usual rules of software design and having the security-related messages change in appearance slightly each time—for example, with different colors—it was possible to reduce the habituation effect. “This shows the potential to use neuroscience to understand people’s behavior and validate new user interface designs,” said Vance. “Our security UI should be designed to be compatible with the way our brains work.” Tagged Google, Chrome, computer security, online security Credit Images courtesy of Department of Psychology & Neuroscience Center at Brigham Young University Tom Simonite San Francisco Bureau Chief I’m MIT Technology Review’s San Francisco bureau chief and enjoy a diverse diet of algorithms, Internet, and human-computer interaction with chips on the side.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) Self-driving car prototypes appear to be getting better at negotiating California streets and highways without a human backup driver intervening, according to data made public Wednesday by California transportation regulators. The data reflect safety-related incidents reported by 11 companies that have been testing more than 100 vehicles on public roads, primarily in the Silicon Valley neighborhoods where the technology has grown up. The reports were made to California's Department of Motor Vehicles, which posted them online. The documents catalog the number of times from December 2015 through the end of November that humans took over control from a car's software for safety reasons. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Waymo, as Google's self-driving car project was recently rebranded, did far more testing than the other 10 companies combined. Waymo reported that its fleet drove itself more than 635,000 miles with 124 safety-related "disengagements," which must be reported when the technology fails or the backup driver takes control out of concern the car is malfunctioning. The Google project's disengagement rate was the equivalent of two incidents every 10,000 miles, a notable decrease over the prior year, when there were eight disengagements per 10,000 miles. "This four-fold improvement reflects the significant work we've been doing to make our software and hardware more capable and mature," Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo's head of self-driving technology wrote in a blog post . Waymo's chief critic acknowledged the improvement, but John Simpson of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog said the number of disengagements shows the cars still "simply aren't ready to be released to roam our roads" without human backup drivers. Cruise Automation, a startup acquired last year by General Motors, reported driving the second most test miles. Cruise said its prototypes had 181 disengagements over 9,776 miles (185 per 10,000 miles) and that it was "pleased with our progress" during testing on the complex streets of San Francisco. Though imperfect, the data represent the best peek the public gets into the secretive and fiercely competitive world of self-driving cars and how the prototypes are performing. California required the disengagement reports as part of regulations governing testing on public roads. Separately, the state also requires companies to report any collisions involving its cars. When the technology will be ready for the public depends on several factors, including regulators' readiness and company confidence the vehicles are safe. While Tesla's Elon Musk has been bullish, talking about months rather than years, companies such as Waymo have suggested 2017 or 2018 is more realistic. Tesla's disengagement report said four prototypes drove a total of 550 miles last fall, experiencing 182 disengagements — the equivalent of 3,309 disengagements every 10,000 miles. Tesla logged the miles primarily to develop a publicly posted video, set to the Rolling Stones song "Paint It Black," of the driver's seat perspective in a car where a person does not have to put their hands on the wheel or feet on the pedals. The video promoted how Tesla was shipping cars with advanced sensors that will be activated in the future. The company already is gathering tens of millions of miles of real-world data when owners engage the current Autopilot feature, which can control steering and speed but is not sophisticated enough to make the cars self-driving from the regulatory perspective. The Department of Motor Vehicles has been working for several years on regulations that will govern how the technology can be rolled out to the public when companies believe testing shows it is ready. » Next page...

Combining the two could be more useful Feb 4th 2017 Add this article to your reading list by clicking this button Tweet SCIENCE fiction both predicts the future and influences the scientists and technologists who work to bring that future about. Mobile phones, to take a famous example, are essentially real-life versions of the hand-held communicators wielded by Captain Kirk and his crewmates in the original series of “Star Trek”. The clamshell models of the mid-2000s even take design cues directly from those fictional devices.  If companies ranging from giants like Microsoft and Google to newcomers like Magic Leap and Meta have their way, the next thing to leap from fiction to fact will be augmented reality (AR). AR is a sci-fi staple, from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s heads-up display in the “Terminator” films to the holographic computer screens that Tom Cruise slings around as a futuristic policeman in “Minority Report”. Related topics Software Apple iPhone Consumer electronics Mobile phones Smart-phones AR is a close cousin to virtual reality (VR). There is, though, a crucial difference between them: the near-opposite meanings they ascribe to the term “reality”. VR aims to drop users into a convincing, but artificial, world. AR, by contrast, supplements the real world by laying useful or entertaining computer-generated data over it. Such an overlay might be a map annotated with directions, or a reminder about a meeting, or even a virtual alien with a ray gun, ripe for blasting. Despite the hype and prominence given recently to VR, people tend to spend more time in real realities than computer-generated ones. AR thus has techies licking their lips in anticipation of a giant new market. Digi-Capital, a firm of merger and acquisitions advisors in California, reckons that of the $108 billion a year which it predicts will be spent by 2021 on VR and AR combined, AR will take three-quarters. Improving on the world Like many science-fictional technologies, AR is in fact already here—just unevenly distributed. An early version was the heads-up displays that began to be fitted to jet fighters in the 1950s. These projected information such as compass headings, altitude and banking angles onto the cockpit canopy. Such displays occasionally turn up in cars, too. But only now, as computers have shrunk enough and become sufficiently powerful, has it become possible to give people a similar sort of experience as they go about their daily lives. Last year, for instance, the world was briefly entranced by an AR smartphone game called Pokémon Go. Players had to wander the world collecting virtual monsters that were, thanks to their phones’ cameras, drawn over a phone’s-eye view of a building’s lobby or a stand of trees. Apps such as Snapchat, which features image filters that permit users to take pictures of themselves and others wearing computer-generated rabbit ears or elaborate virtual make-up, are another example. There are less frivolous uses, too. Google’s Translate app employs computer vision, automatic translation and a smartphone’s camera to show an image of the world that has text, such as items on menus and street signs, interpreted into any of several dozen languages. Apps like Snapchat and Translate rely on machine-vision algorithms to work their magic. Snapchat is designed to detect faces. This works well enough, but means that the bunny ears can be applied only to heads. Translate, similarly, looks for text in the world upon which to work its magic. But smartphone-makers have bigger plans. At the end of last year Google and Lenovo, a Chinese hardware manufacturer, unveiled the Phab 2 Pro, the first phone to implement a piece of Google technology called Tango. The idea is that, by giving the phone an extra set of sensors, it can detect the shape of the world around it. Using information from infra-red detectors, a wide-angle lens and a “time-of-flight” camera (which measures how long pulses of light take to reflect off the phone’s surroundings) Tango is able to build up a three-dimensional image of those surroundings. Armed with all this, a Tango-enabled phone can model a house, an office or any other space, and then use that model as a canvas upon which to draw things. To give an idea of what is possible, Google has written apps that would be impossible on Tango-less phones. “Measure”, for instance, overlays a virtual tape measure on the phone’s screen. Point it at a door, and it will tell you how wide and high that portal is. Point it at a bed, and you get the bed’s dimensions—letting you work out whether it will fit through the door. Another Tango app is the oddly spelled “Woorld”, which lets users fill their living rooms with virtual flowers, houses and rocket ships, all of which will interact appropriately with the scenery. Place the rocket behind a television, for instance, and the set will block your view of it. Through a pair of glasses, virtually The effect Tango gives is impressive, but the technology is still in its early stages. Building 3D models of the world is computationally demanding, and quickly drains even the Phab 2 Pro’s beefy battery. The models themselves quickly use up the phone’s data-storage capacity. And the touchscreen of a phone is a clumsy way of communicating with the software. Some enthusiasts of augmented reality therefore think that the technology will not take off properly until smartphones can be abandoned in favour of smart spectacles that can superimpose images on whatever their wearers happen to be looking at. Such glasses do exist. So far, though, they have made a bigger impact on the workplace than in the home. Companies such as Ubimax, in Germany, or Vuzix, in New York, make AR spectacles that include cameras and sensors, and which use a projector mounted on the frame to place what looks like a small, two-dimensional screen into one corner of the wearer’s vision. Used in warehouses, for instance, that screen—in combination with technology which tracks workers and parcels—can give an employee instructions on where to go, the fastest route to get there and what to pick up when he arrives, all the while leaving both of his hands free to move boxes around. Ubimax reckons that could bring a 25% improvement in efficiency. At a conference in London in October, Boeing, a big American aeroplane-maker, described how it was using AR glasses to give workers in its factories step-by-step instructions on how to assemble components, as well as to check that the job had been done properly. The result, said Paul Davies of Boeing’s research division, is faster work with fewer mistakes. The one serious attempt to offer individual consumers such technology did not, though, go well. Like Vuzix’s and Ubimax’s products, Google’s “Glass”, released in 2013, was a pair of spectacles with a small projector mounted on one arm. The idea was, in effect, to create a wearable smartphone that would let its user make calls, read e-mails, see maps and use the Glass’s built-in GPS to navigate, all the while leaving his hands free for other tasks. The problem was not with the users. Google’s “Glass Explorers”—those willing to pay $1,500 for early access to the hardware—seemed happy enough. But, often, those they interacted with were not. Glass Explorers quickly attracted the nickname “Glassholes” from those annoyed by their proclivity to glance at e-mails in the middle of a conversation, or worried that the device let wearers record everything going on around them. (Some restaurants banned Glass users on privacy grounds.) Google stopped making Glass early in 2015, although it is working on a new version aimed at businesses instead of individuals. Other firms have more limited ambitions, but may do better for that. RideOn, for instance, is an Israeli outfit founded by three engineers with experience in designing heads-up displays for aircraft. It will soon start selling augmented-reality ski goggles. The idea is to turn skiing into a video game, by showing users routes, letting them time runs, compete with their friends, shoot footage and the like. Some companies are building much more capable displays. Instead of 2D images, they propose to create augmented reality in three dimensions. In March 2016 Microsoft began making early versions of a headset called the HoloLens available to software developers around the world. Unlike the AR glasses produced by Vuzix and Ubimax, or Google’s Glass, the HoloLens can draw 3D images that appear to exist in the real world. Users can walk around a virtual motorbike, for instance, to inspect it from behind, or place virtual ornaments on real tables or shelves. It is, in other words, like a Tango-enabled smartphone—only much more capable. The device’s cameras, derived from the Kinect (an accessory originally developed for Microsoft’s Xbox 360 games console), scan the world around it. Those cameras generate such a flood of information that Microsoft has had to design a special chip to process all the incoming data. Armed with that understanding, and with the ability to track the position of its user’s head, the machine can tailor its graphics accordingly: making a virtual motorbike appear to be standing on a real floor, for instance. The same cameras let the wearer interact with the machine via voice commands, by making gestures in mid-air, or by tracking precisely where he is looking. Unlike VR headsets, which must be connected to either a PC or a smartphone to work, the HoloLens is a self-contained computer that needs no accessories. Users view the world through a pair of thick, transparent lenses. A pair of projectors feed light into the top of these lenses. Three optical waveguides (one each for red, green and blue light—the primary colours from which others can be created) funnel that light down the lenses before bending it through 90° and into the user’s eyes. By overlaying its images onto the real world, the HoloLens headset turns reality into a computer monitor. A window containing a Skype call can be placed onto an office wall, disappearing when the user looks away and returning when he looks back at it. A computerised calendar can be placed on the desk (or the ceiling, if you prefer). All this information can be seen without having to cut yourself off completely from the outside world, as a VR headset would require. Some of the first demonstrations of the HoloLens involved games. In one, users blasted aliens that took cover behind their living-room sofas. In a second, they played with blocks from Minecraft, a sort of virtual Lego, on their living-room tables. More recent apps have focused on business and training. One such, developed in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, projects a human body into the room to help with the teaching of anatomy. A wave of the hands can add muscles to the skeleton, or bring the heart out of the chest to examine it more closely. Augmenting the enterprise The HoloLens can be used collaboratively, as well. Another demo has someone being instructed how to repair a light-switch by someone else, who is employing videoconferencing software in another room to do so. The guide can see what the HoloLens user sees, and can draw on top of his field of view—putting circles around objects of interest or highlighting the correct tool in a box. ThyssenKrupp, a German engineering firm, is experimenting with giving the devices to its lift repairmen. Should anyone encounter a particularly difficult job, he can call head office for specialist advice. Users can also connect to each other and see the same augmented reality (in true science-fiction style, other users appear as golden, androgynous, vaguely Art Deco-looking figures). Aecom, an international firm of architects and engineers, is already using the HoloLens to help design buildings. Modern building projects can be very complicated, says John Endicott, one of Aecom’s executive directors—to the point where even experienced designers have trouble keeping everything in their heads. In 2016 the firm designed buildings around the Serpentine art gallery, in London. Mr Endicott observes that, “the roofs of these things had very complex geometry. We simply couldn’t check it on a 2D screen, but the HoloLens let us all review it together.” Trimble, an American engineering firm, helped Aecom develop the system. “We’re also finding it has applications in everything from mining to agriculture to facilities management,” says Aviad Almagor, the director of Trimble’s “mixed reality” programme. “You can do things like track assets [such as miners, lorries or equipment] as they move round a 3D model of a mine, in real time.” The HoloLens is far from perfect, however. The AR magic happens in only a small slice of a user’s view (some have likened it to looking in on the computer-generated world through a letterbox). Though the headset is light (weighing around 600g) and comfortable, it is bulky and not exactly fashionable. And using the gesture-tracking system to interact with the illusions the headset generates can feel clunky and awkward. It is not yet on general sale, but when it is (Microsoft has given no firm date) its price tag—also unknown, though the versions sold to software developers go for at least $3,000—is likely to make it a business-only proposition. Microsoft is not the only firm working on advanced AR headsets. One rival is Meta, in San Mateo, California. Compared with Microsoft this firm is a tiddler, having raised only $73m in funding so far. But its engineers promise a much wider field of view than the HoloLens’s. Microsoft’s product can track a few hand gestures. Meta’s is designed to keep a constant eye on exactly what a user’s hands are up to, letting him “handle” virtual objects simply by picking them up and rotating them. Another potential rival, Osterhout Design Group, in San Francisco, which makes AR glasses for industrial and medical companies, has announced two products aimed at individuals. Though less technically capable than the HoloLens, both are sleeker than their rival. Microsoft’s best-known competitor in this area, though, is Magic Leap, a firm founded in Florida in 2010, which has attracted $1.4 billion in investment from companies such as Google and Ali Baba, China’s biggest online retailer, as well as plenty of attention for its snazzy promotional videos. It has kept its technological cards close to its chest—to the point where some sceptics think that its technology has been oversold. But the demos it has released show images much clearer and crisper than those Microsoft can manage with the HoloLens. Curb your enthusiasm For all the hype, AR is still at an early stage, especially as a consumer technology. Forecasts of markets worth squillions by the end of the decade should be taken with a good deal of salt, especially since virtual reality, AR’s close and even-more-hyped cousin, has so far proved a bit of a damp squib. No VR headset-maker has yet released official sales figures, but the numbers that have trickled out look modest. In October 2016 Cher Wang, chairwoman of HTC, a Taiwanese consumer-electronics company, told 87870 News, a Chinese website, that her firm had sold 140,000 of its Vive headsets since their launch the previous April. (By way of comparison, Apple sells more than 870,000 iPhones a day.) In November SuperData, a market-research firm in New York, described VR as “the biggest loser” in the American shopping season around Thanksgiving, and cut its sales forecasts for Sony’s PlayStation VR headset in 2016 from 2.6m to 750,000. Even among keen techies, enthusiasm for VR seems limited. A survey by Steam, an online shop that dominates the market for PC gaming, found that just 0.38% of its customers owned a VR headset in December, a number unchanged from the previous month. If AR is not to go the same way, it will have to be made easier to use. That probably means consumer versions will be adapted for peoples’ phones. As Tim Merel, Digi-Capital’s boss, points out, phones are a known quantity that people are comfortable with. They have become, for many, their default computing device. Their existing app stores offer developers an easy way to sell software, and their business model—in which the cost of the hardware is often subsidised by network operators, who recoup this investment with fees and rental charges as they go along—could help draw some of the financial sting of the initial outlay a customer must make. On the other hand, a phone’s screen is small and fiddly, and holding it up every time you want to use an AR app could become tedious. Headsets such as the HoloLens offer a way around this problem. Those currently in development will cost thousands of dollars and look more than a little silly. For now, that will limit their uptake to companies, which can afford the hardware and are less worried about the aesthetics. But the hope is that the mix of sensors and computing power needed to run AR can be shrunk to the point where, as Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, put it at a show for developers last April: “we’re going to have what look like normal-looking glasses that can do both virtual and augmented reality.” Others want to go further still. Samsung and Apple, for instance, are exploring the idea of AR-enabled contact lenses. For now, such devices remain far away. Those in the computing industry like to talk of an “iPhone moment”, when a well-crafted product launches, almost single-handedly, a new phase of the computing revolution. But such moments are the culmination of years of research into, and development of, many different technologies. The iPhone was not the first smartphone. No self-respecting salaryman of the mid-2000s was without a BlackBerry, and the basic idea can trace its ancestry back at least as far as the hand-held personal digital assistants of the 1990s. None of the present approaches to AR seems likely to change the world as the iPhone did. But those behind them hope that, one day, a combination of them will.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business Companies anticipate big software deals, with help from Trump THURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2017, 9:55 A.M. By Brian Womack Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS The software industry went on a shopping spree in 2016, and this year could be even busier, bolstered by the new president’s policies and what one analyst suggests could be a major deal by Google. The value of software deals in 2016 topped $115 billion for acquisitions closed or pending, according to data gathered by Bloomberg. That’s up about 19 percent from 2015 and easily outpaced the growth of deals in the overall technology market, which was slightly down. And this year is already off to a strong start with Cisco Systems Inc. agreeing to acquire AppDynamics Inc. for $3.7 billion right as the company was planning to go public. Oracle Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. were among the bigger buyers in 2016, but this year companies that have been relatively quiet may step up, analysts say. They could include other important names in enterprise technology — and potentially some of the biggest players in the broader industry: Google and Amazon.com. The new Trump administration has talked about rewriting tax provisions that could return profits stored away in other countries, which would fuel the size and frequency of deals. And while blockbuster deals can be difficult to pull off, some see the potential for Google pursuing Salesforce. “There’s no question that’s it going to be an active year,” said Crawford Del Prete, an analyst at IDC. “The stakes are just so high for these software companies to make sure that they stay relevant.” Arete Research Services, an influential research firm, issued a report arguing why Google parent Alphabet Inc. should make a big merger splash and buy Salesforce. The note says Google could nab it for around $73 billion, immediately giving its cloud business surer footing in enterprise sales. Such a deal would also have a better chance of passing regulatory muster than one in ads or search, according to the Arete analysts. It’s a radical proposal, but not implausible. Google is pouring nearly everything it has into the cloud. Since recruiting enterprise veteran Diane Greene in late 2015, Google has invested internal resources and acquisition coffers in her division, which includes its customized workplace apps and cloud storage service. Google and Salesforce both declined to comment. But not everyone thinks it’s a certainty. “I wouldn’t think this is particularly likely,” said Jonathan Atkin, managing director of RBC Capital Markets. “But this is a way to jump-start their momentum they have in their cloud product. It’s an acquisition of a customer base, effectively.” Amazon is also trying to grow its cloud business. It’s the largest player in the so-called public cloud, which lets customers easily rent computing and storage power at their data centers. Amazon declined to comment on potential acquisitions. “I think you’re going to start seeing them being more aggressive in 2017,” said Sean Jacobsohn, a venture investor at Norwest Venture Partners. A potential change in tax laws could free up more spending money for a lot of players. U.S. companies have earned profits overseas for years, but have tucked them away in foreign countries to escape a U.S. tax rate of 35 percent. As long as the profits remain overseas, they remain untouched by the government. Yet Trump’s nominee for the Treasury Department, Steve Mnuchin, may give companies a new incentive. He said in November he wanted to bring “a lot of cash back to the U.S.,” proposing a one-time 10 percent repatriation tax to return corporate tax revenue held abroad, another key promise by Trump. “I expect that ‘17 will be another big year in M&A, particularly if we get repatriation or a tax cut,” said Joel Fishbein, an analyst at BTIG. “I think that will spur more M&A as some of those offshore dollars can be used for domestic acquisitions.” There is a lot of corporate money overseas that could come back inside the country if Trump acts on taxes. Oracle and Microsoft have more than 80 percent of their cash, near-term cash and short-term investments in foreign subsidiaries, according to recent filings. The cash overseas held by large tech companies runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars, according to Ross MacMillan, an analyst with RBC, and that’s money companies may use to go shopping. Oracle and Microsoft declined to comment. Overall in 2016, the value of merger-and-acquisition business software deals totaled $117.6 billion— and included a wide swath of software companies in technology sectors, along with some in health care and entertainment. That doesn’t include the blockbuster tech deal of the year: Microsoft paying $26 billion for LinkedIn. LinkedIn does not fit neatly into the category of business software because of its professional networking tools that are used by workers outside of business hours. Even without repatriation, companies are sitting on a lot of cash that can be used to finance deals. Cisco — which has about $70 billion in cash and equivalents and investments overall — saw opportunity to expand its business-software capabilities with the deal for AppDynamics, which had previously been valued at more than $1 billion, making it a so-called unicorn. It’s the biggest software acquisition for the company since 2012. The purchase is also significant because it derailed the first potential IPO of the year for a U.S. tech company. Now it’s seen by some advisers as the first in a long-expected wave of unicorn buyouts. With more than 150 companies valued at more than $1 billion and a temperamental IPO market, being acquired offers startups an exit from the funding roller coaster and can also shield them from the regulatory and investor scrutiny that comes with a public listing. “IPO investors still aren’t paying premiums, so M&A looks like an attractive option to private companies,” according to Dan Scholnick, a general partner at Trinity Ventures. Unless IPO investors are willing “to pay up, the M&A trend will continue.” IBM Corp., which recently reported its 19th consecutive quarter of sales decline, could gobble up smaller companies to reinvigorate growth as well. IBM declined to comment. SAP, a rival to Oracle and Salesforce, might also be on the hunt for cloud acquisition targets, analysts say. Its last big multibillion-deal came in 2014 when it spent more than $7 billion on Concur Technologies, which helps businesses manage travel expenses. Still, SAP, which declined to comment on specific future targets, signaled it will look at acquisitions under $1 billion. Still, there are several factors, analysts say, that could lead to a disappointing 2017 for deals. The Trump administration could fail to pass tax reform. And because 2016 was such a busy year, it may be difficult to keep up the pace; some of the acquirers will need time integrate their purchases. Some say that many of the interesting companies got picked up last year. “You did see a lot of good assets come off the table,” said Rodney Nelson, an analyst at Morningstar. Not everything, though. Analysts say two big potential targets for companies looking to expand their cloud services are Workday Inc., a provider of human resources software, and ServiceNow, which helps companies manage technology and human resources tools. Both are relatively large with a valuation of about $15 billion. Both companies declined to comment. Other companies that might look like good buys include FireEye Inc., a security company; Hubspot Inc., a cloud-based marketing service; and Zendesk Inc., which serves call centers, according to Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya February 02, 2017 Google’s empire is built on advertising—and over the past year the company has been discreetly adding more of it in more places. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Mountain View, California-based Google (now the search engine arm of parent company Alphabet) posted advertising revenue of $22.4 billion, up 17% over the same quarter in 2015 and accounting for 87% of all Google revenue in the quarter. In 2015, Google accounted for fully half of the record $60 billion in revenue generated by the entire digital advertising industry, analyst Brian Wieser told Bloomberg. While Google’s command of search is exceedingly strong—the company told Search Engine Land it handled more than 2 trillion searches last year, up from 1.2 trillion in 2012—not all of its ad revenue is coming from the same old slots. Google has also been adding sponsored results in entirely new places. Perhaps most significantly, Google is executing a shift from desktop to mobile, as users move away from personal computers and toward handheld devices. Early last year, the company began removing ads in the right rail on its desktop search-results page, while increasing the number of ad slots on mobile. Ginny Marvin, an online marketing expert and contributing editor at Search Engine Land, says the pivot is to be expected as “more ad clicks are coming on mobile.” (That said, the disparity between desktop and mobile ad prices means Google’s “cost-per-click,” or the amount the company makes from advertisers each time someone clicks on an ad, is still falling.) Ads are popping up elsewhere too: In 2016, routine searches sometimes turned up as many as four of five sponsored results, compared with one or two a few years ago. (The number of ads vary each time a query is entered.) Google also slipped sponsored results into image searches, and added a second ad slot in its Google Play Store. The company bumped up advertising on YouTube, and developed video-advertising opportunities like its partnership with Turner Sports to deliver behind-­the-­scenes NBA pre­game footage in real time. Google even boasted that YouTube ads are superior to TV spots. At the end of 2016, the company also introduced its ‘Promoted Places’ feature, which allows retailers to brand their pin results in Google Maps, share ongoing promotions, and help shoppers avoid crowds by pinging them when a store is at its busiest. The addition was a crucial one: A third of Google’s mobile searches are for nearby locations. Google does not break out advertising revenue by type (sponsored search results versus Promoted Places, for example). “This was the year that mobile shopping went truly mainstream, with shoppers using phones as they go to the store to locate nearby retailers, find promotions and comparison-shop,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. As evidence of the opportunity for retailers, Pichai cited a fourfold increase in mobile traffic to Gap’s e-commerce site between December 2015 and December 2016 after the clothing store increased its US mobile search ad spend. That Google would be both increasing and diversifying its ad offerings may be annoying for users, but it comes as no surprise: People are changing what they search for, and how they search for it. Google also faces upstart competition in both Facebook and Amazon. The former commanded $8 billion of the digital ad market last year, and the latter’s ad business is growing like a beast.

QR Codes Are a Risky Business Why have we got such a downer on QR codes? Mainly because they pose a security risk every time you scan one. The problem is you have no idea where a QR code is going to lead you before you click on it. So you could be taken to a phishing page, or a webpage laden with malware. Hackers have even been known to stick their dodgy QR codes over the top of legitimate QR codes on posters. So if you’re randomly scanning QR codes with your phone you’re opening yourself up to unnecessary risk. However, this doesn’t seem to be affecting the renewed rise of QR codes.

What can we learn from the winners and losers of organic search in 2016? Industry SEO 02 Feb 17 | Rebecca Sentance Facebook0 Linkedin18 Google+9 Twitter 27 Who were the winners and losers of organic search in 2016? For the third year in a row, Searchmetrics has published its annual Winners and Losers Report, which reveals how certain sites fared in organic search visibility on Google.com over the course of 2016. Searchmetrics’ analysis is based on the ‘SEO Visibility’ of each website, an indicator developed by Searchmetrics to measure a webpage’s performance in organic search. This is not the same as organic search ranking, but aims to give an overview of how often a website shows up in search results, based on “search volume and the position of ranking keywords” (as set out in the Searchmetrics FAQ). Based on this metric, Searchmetrics then analysed the change in websites’ SEO Visibility during the course of the year, and sorted the top 100 winners and losers by absolute change in visibility. While the results are limited to Google.com – and thus are mostly applicable to websites from the U.S. – they are an interesting insight into how the trends and algorithm changes that we cover throughout the course of the year affect sites in real terms. So who did well out of 2016, and what was the secret to their success? What caused the downfall of the poor performers? The winners: social media and shopping Among the biggest winners, although only making up 10% of the ‘winner’ sites overall, was social media. Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook all ranked in the top 10 in terms of absolute gains, with Pinterest the surprise leader of the back – it came in at #2 in terms of overall visibility (Google, surprise surprise, was #1) and had a whopping 80% gain in overall visibility during the year. We’ve already covered Pinterest’s prowess as a platform for visual search, which goes a long way towards helping keep users on its site by finding Pins which are visually similar to what they’re looking for. Searchmetrics attributes Pinterest’s success in SEO visibility to its forays into deep learning, which “generate more relevant results that evolve based on user behavior. Like Apple, Google (and even Searchmetrics), Pinterest’s application of deep-learning techniques is a key step in helping software understand the ultimate intent of a user, thereby generating more loyalty and stickiness online.” While not every site has the resources or the technology to experiment with deep learning, the idea of generating “stickiness” and giving users an incentive to come back to the site again and again is something all site owners/SEOs can aim for (and many already do). Improving a site’s internal search to help users find what they’re looking for more easily is another way to achieve this. Shopping was another significant category of website that did well over the year 2016, with nearly a fifth (19%) of sites that ‘won’ falling into this category. Searchmetrics attributed this trend to “relatively steady economies” and “strong economic recovery”. Among the successful ecommerce sites in 2016 were ebay.com, target.com, retailmenot.com and walmart.com. Two of the retail sites which saw the biggest percentage gains in visibility were theblackfriday.com (217%) and blackfriday.com (212%), which illustrates the SEO power of exact-match domains – when used carefully. Media: the ups and downs Media and publishing was the largest category of ‘winners’ in 2016, with nearly two-fifths (38%) of sites who gained SEO visibility falling into this category. However, a large number of media sites also lost visibility in the same period, with the likes of Wired, USAToday, NYMag, Time and BuzzFeed all appearing in the ‘losers’ category. So why the discrepancy? Searchmetrics’ analysis pointed to the ‘Google News-Wave‘ update of 2015 as one possible cause. The ‘News-Wave’ update, as dubbed by Searchmetrics, was a mysterious update to Google’s core algorithm which caused a lot of media, magazines and news websites to rise in search visibility. It’s possible that this bump in visibility has now been reset by other adjustments, causing the affected publishers to sink back down in the rankings, or that the algorithm change introduced more volatility in general for media publishers in search. Searchmetrics’ graph plotting SEO visibility for theatlantic.com in 2016 – and showcasing a huge drop in visibility midway through April Google’s Panda algorithm update also rewards quality, in-depth content above thinner, more short-form content, which may be the reason behind a rankings drop for some publishers. However, not all publishers lost out. Among the ‘winners’ in publishing were the New York Times, The Huffington Post and the LA Times, as well as more niche publications like GameSpot, Livescience, Rolling Stone and Women’s Health Mag. The bigger news titles will likely have benefited from the huge flurry of political events which dominated the headlines in 2016, but for smaller publications, it seems as though focusing on a specific interest area is the way to go for better SEO visibility.

One or two other notable trends to be observed from the data are that dictionary and encyclopaedia websites frequently numbered among the losers in 2016. Not exclusively – four or five dictionary or encyclopaedia sites were still found among the winners, including Oxford Dictionaries and Macmillan Dictionary. However, online encyclopaedias were far more likely to lose out in SEO visibility than to succeed, with major sites like Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Urban Dictionary and Thesaurus.com all suffering a loss in visibility. This trend is probably attributable to Google’s increasing inclusion of encyclopaedia-style information on the front page of search in the form of Quick Answers, featured snippets and Google Knowledge Graph, reducing the need for users to click through to a reference site for more information. If Google makes user ratings for films and TV shows a permanent feature in search, we might start to see a decline in the visibility of film and TV ratings websites like Rotten Tomatoes as well. A downward trend in visibility for thefreedictionary.com Meanwhile, another type of reference site suffered a drop in visibility in 2016: lyrics sites. Metrolyrics.com and Lyricsmode.com both saw big drops in visibility of 43% and 54% respectively, although A-Z Lyrics saw a small rise of visibility of 7%. Meanwhile, music providers like Apple, Spotify and Deezer all saw big gains. The fall in lyrics sites doesn’t mean that lyrics are no longer in demand, but rather that users are getting them from elsewhere. The likes of Amazon Music and Apple Music are increasingly including lyrics with the products they sell, while music publication Genius (which rose in visibility by 34%) also provides lyrics on its site. While it’s probably too early to declare the death of the lyrics site, sites which only provide one thing will inevitably become obsolete as soon as people start being able to get that thing elsewhere. What can we learn from the winners and losers of 2016? Some of the ups and downs of the Searchmetrics Winners and Losers Report are reflective of general online trends, and not necessarily anything that SEOs need to account for (although if you run a lyrics website, take note!). But from the rest, there are a few things we can learn: The ‘stickier’ your website and the more people like to return to it, the better. It also helps if you have put thought into user intent in navigation and internal search Well thought-out, high quality content continues to be a winner with Google’s algorithms When it comes to publishing, targeting a specific niche – rather than trying to spread your coverage over too wide a ground – will also help you rank in search For reference sites, Google’s Quick Answers and featured snippets can be a real blow. But for the rest of us, they can be a huge boost in visibility if you know how to cater to them properly. Rebecca Sentance is the Deputy Editor at ClickZ and Search Engine Watch.

Does dwell time really matter for SEO? Analytics SEO 02 Feb 17 | Larry Kim Facebook0 Linkedin33 Google+18 Twitter 51 What’s the real impact of machine learning on SEO? This has been one of the biggest debates within SEO over the last year. Please note, this article was originally published on the Wordstream blog; it is reprinted with permission. I won’t lie: I’ve become a bit obsessed with machine learning. My theory is that RankBrain and/or other machine learning elements within Google’s core algorithm are increasingly rewarding pages with high user engagement. Basically, Google wants to find unicorns – pages that have extraordinary user engagement metrics like organic search click-through rate (CTR), dwell time, bounce rate, and conversion rate – and reward that content with higher organic search rankings. Happier, more engaged users means better search results, right? So, essentially, machine learning is Google’s Unicorn Detector. Machine Learning & Click-Through Rate Many SEO experts and influencers have said that it’s totally impossible to find any evidence of Google RankBrain in the wild. That’s ridiculous. You just need to run SEO experiments and be smarter about how you conduct those experiments. That’s why, in the past, I ran an experiment that looked at CTR over time. I was hoping to find evidence of machine learning. What I found: results that have higher organic search CTRs are getting pushed higher up the SERPs and getting more clicks: Click-through rate is just one way to see the impact of machine learning algorithms. Today, let’s look at another important engagement metric: long clicks, or visits that stay on site for a long time after leaving the SERP. Time on Site Acts as a Proxy for Long Clicks Are you not convinced that long clicks impact organic search rankings (whether directly or indirectly)? Well, I’ve come up with a super easy way that you can prove to yourself that the long click matters – while also revealing the impact of machine learning algorithms. In today’s experiment, we’re going to measure time on page. To be clear: time on page isn’t the same as dwell time or a long click (or, how long people stay on your website before they hit the back button to return to the search results from which they found you). We can’t measure long clicks or dwell time in Google Analytics. Only Google has access to this data. Time on page really doesn’t matter to us. We’re only looking at time on page because it is very likely proportional to those metrics. Time on Site & Organic Traffic (Before RankBrain) To get started, go into your analytics account. Pick a time frame before the new algorithms were in play (i.e., 2015). Segment your content report to view only your organic traffic, and then sort by pageviews. Then you want to run a Comparison Analysis that compares your pageviews to average time on page. You’ll see something like this: These 32 pages drove our most organic traffic in 2015. Time on site is above average for about two-thirds of these pages, but it’s below average for the remaining third. See all those red arrows? Those are donkeys – pages that were ranking well in organic search, but in all honestly probably had no business ranking well, at least for the search queries that were driving the most traffic. They were out of their league. Time on page was half or a third of the site average. Time on Site & Organic Traffic (After RankBrain) Now let’s do the same analysis. But we’re going to use a more recent time period when we know Google’s machine learning algorithms were in use (e.g., the last three or four months). Do the same comparison analysis. You’ll see something like this: Look at what happens now when we analyze the organic traffic. All but two of our top pages have above average time on page. This is kind of amazing to see. So what’s happening? Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin33 Google+18 Twitter 51 Related articles What can we learn from the winners and losers of organic search in 2016? All you need to master your site speed without getting overwhelmed Five common mistakes small businesses make with their online presence Seven ways to elevate your personal and professional SEO performance in 2017 Does Longer Dwell Time = Higher Search Rankings? It seems that Google’s machine learning algorithms have seen through all those pages that used to rank well in 2015, but really didn’t deserve to be ranking well. And, to me, it certainly looks like Google is rewarding higher dwell time with more prominent search positions. Google detected most of the donkeys (about 80 percent of them!) and now nearly all the pages with the most organic traffic are time-on-site unicorns. I won’t tell you which pages on the WordStream site those donkeys are, but I will tell you that some of those pages were created simply to bring in traffic (mission: successful), and the alignment with search intent wasn’t great. Probably someone created a page that matched the intent better. In fact, here’s one example: Our AdWords Grader used to rank on page 1 for the query “google adwords” (which has huge search volume – over 300,000 searches a month!). The intent match there is low – most people who search for that phrase are just using it as a navigational keyword, to get to the AdWords site. A small percentage of those searchers might just want to know more about Google AdWords and what it is, kind of using Google as a way to find a Wikipedia page. There’s no indication from the query that they might be looking for a tool to help them diagnose AdWords problems. And guess what? In 2015, the Grader page was one of those top 30 pages, but it had below average time on site. So at some point, Google tested a different result in place of the Grader – our infographic about how Google AdWords works. It’s still ranking on page 1 for that search query, and it matches the informational intent of the keyword much better. A Few Caveats on the Data To be clear, I know these analytics reports don’t directly show a loss in rankings. There are other potential explanations for the differences in the reports – maybe we created lots of new, super-awesome content that’s ranking for higher-volume keywords and they simply displaced the time-on-site “donkeys” from 2015. Further, there are certain types of pages that might have low time on site for a perfectly acceptable reason (for example, they might provide the info the user wants very quickly). But internally, we know for sure that a few of our pages that had below average time on site have fallen in the rankings (again, at least for certain keywords) in the past couple of years. And regardless, it’s very compelling to see that the pages that are driving the most organic traffic overall (the WordStream site has thousands of pages) have way above average time on site. It strongly suggests that pages with excellent, unicorn-level engagement metrics are going to be the most valuable to your business overall. This report also revealed something ridiculously important for us: the pages with below average time on site are our most vulnerable pages in terms of SEO. In other words, those two remaining pages in the second chart above that still have below average time on site are the ones that are most likely to lose organic rankings and traffic in the new machine learning world. What’s so great about this report is you don’t have to do a lot of research or hire an SEO to do an extensive audit. Just open up your analytics and look at the data yourself. You should be able to compare changes from a long time ago to recent history (the last three or four months). What Does It All Mean? This report is basically your donkey detector. It will show you the content that could be most vulnerable for future incremental traffic and search rankings losses from Google. That’s how machine learning works. Machine learning doesn’t eliminate all your traffic overnight (like a Panda or Penguin). It’s gradual. What should you do if you have a lot of donkey content? Prioritize the pages that are most at risk – those that are below average or near average. If there’s not a really good reason for those pages to have below average time on site, put these at top of your list for rewriting or fixing up so they align better with user intent. Now go look at your own data and see if you agree that time-on-site plays a role in your organic search rankings. Don’t just take my word for it. Go look: run your own reports and let me know what you find. Want to stay on top of the latest search trends?Get top insights and news from our search experts.

Show More These days, we're all living in a Material world. Don't worry: I'm not about to get all Madonna on you. I'm talking about Material with a capital "M" -- the name of Google's multiplatform design standard and a term increasingly representative of the Android experience. Material Design, after all, is the set of principles that guides how your Android devices look and work (as far as what's actually on the screen -- which is arguably the most important part of the equation). It extends not only throughout the entire operating system but also throughout the entire ecosystem. It affects more and more non-Android entities all the time, too -- everything from Chrome OS to Google's universal web apps and a variety of other sites and software. It only makes sense, then, that one of the best podcasts about Android and the broader Google universe would use "Material" in its name. I'm talking about the Material Podcast -- and hang onto your hats, gang, 'cause for this month's How I Use Android profile, we have the pleasure of getting to know one of the show's outstanding hosts. Her name is Yasmine Evjen (that's "ev-YEN," for the uninitiated -- as you'd know if you ever listened to her show, you slacker). Each week, Yasmine and her co-hosts -- PocketCasts developer Russell Ivanovic and Chicago Sun-Times tech columnist Andy Ihnatko -- chat about all the latest goings-on in the Google world. For Evjen, the notion of Material extends far beyond the weekly podcast. Her other job, you see, is being a UX (user experience) designer and product manager. She works at an agency in Arizona and helps everyone from startups to long-established businesses build apps for both Android and iOS as well as for the web. So, yeah: The illustrious Ms. E knows her stuff, to put it mildly -- and she isn't afraid to share her exceptionally well-grounded thoughts. I don't know about you, but that makes me curious about how she sets up her own devices and makes the most of Android in her own personal life. Let's get some answers, shall we? In her own words, this is how Yasmine Evjen uses Android. The basics Your current primary phone: I’m carrying a "Quite Black" Pixel. At first impressions, the phone isn’t anything to write home about. They played it safe with the design and nothing screams "You need to have this!" But once you see what the camera can do, you’ll never want to put it down. Google has finally delivered a solid device with sound software and hardware that can keep up. Captured this picture on the Pixel: Yasmine Evjen What case is on your phone (if any): I ordered a Photos Live Case by Google. The case is slim and the ability to upload any photo means you have endless designs to choose from. I commissioned my friend Daniel Farrelly to illustrate a case for me with Yasdroids, cacti, and Android treats. I love it. Your current tablet (if any): I bought an iPad Air a couple of years ago, and we received a Nexus 9 as a gift from Google I/O in 2015. Both of those tablets get a lot of love from our daughter, and I haven’t found a need to upgrade. Your current smartwatch (if any): Still using the first-generation Asus ZenWatch. It’s so big, everyone jokes that it’s a tablet on my wrist. It was the first watch to have rose gold accents and go beyond the black brick design. I haven’t updated throughout the years because there hasn’t been much of an incentive. Although the new watches improved in style, they still were too large. I’m crossing my fingers for the rumored Google watches that are coming out early February. Please let them have Android Pay, please! What face you're using on your watch right now: I keep on shuffling through ustwo's watch faces. They’re the same studio behind Monument Valley and their collection of Android Wear watch faces is lovely. They’ve reimagined time and found ways to integrate your appointments and weather into it. I have a feeling their Bits complications watch face will be popular with the release of Android Wear 2.0. The home screen A quick walk-through of your phone's home screen setup: Last year, I got a lot of heat for my folder addiction. Every app was neatly organized into folders that let me get to what I needed with one tap and a few swipes. When I received the Pixel, I took a different approach. I kept the most-used apps as well as the apps I needed to quickly access as icons on the home screen. That includes communications apps like Slack, Hangouts (SMS), and Twitter as well as productivity apps like Inbox, Calendar, Keep, and Todoist -- plus the staples like the Phone and Chrome apps. Yasmine Evjen People will be proud that I’ve replaced my Camera app with the Photos app, since I can quickly access the camera by pressing the power button twice. I still have a few folders that hold apps for controlling my home and media as well as apps used for work and social media access. Last but not least, I have three widgets at the top that control the Philips Hue lights in my house. Everything else is accessed via the app drawer. What launcher you're using: I’ve always been a fan of Action Launcher. Chris Lacy is doing really neat things in that arena. Action Launcher lets you access widgets by swiping up on an icon, making it really easy to get things done. When I bought the Pixel, I wanted to give the stock Pixel Launcher a chance, and now I really like it. I still miss some of the advanced features, but the Pixel Launcher is simple and beautiful to look at. What wallpaper you're using: Currently have "Powder, Misty Green" from the "New Elements" collection inside Google’s Wallpapers app. Wallpapers might have been one of my favorite releases that came with the Pixel. It's superb. You need to check out the "Live Earth" series. Some favorites are "Your World, Solar System" and "Horizon." "Your World, Solar System" is Google Earth’s view from space based on your location, with real-time clouds. It’s fun to see the city lights start to turn on in the east and slowly make their way to the west. "Horizon" is a battery level indicator. The sun starts to rise as your phone charges and lowers as the battery is used. Anything else of note (interesting customizations, special icons, etc): Before the Pixel, my favorite icon pack was Iride UI. The icon pack solved the inconsistent icon size issue while still respecting the original icon design. It created a unified home screen, and I loved it. When I got the Pixel, I wanted to see how apps were handling the new round icons. The round icons are growing on me, but I wish people would stop putting their old icons on a white plate. Yes, Google Music: I’m looking at you. Now non-round icons are hard for me to look at. Android apps, please update your icon to a circle. Roman Nurik even created a tool to help you generate an icon. The experience and the apps What's one of your favorite Android-related tips or tricks? Ever find yourself needing to edit a character in a line of text? But you don’t want to delete the entire word? Fear not, Android* user: I have a product for you! Introducing the incredible power of slide on Gboard’s space bar. Slide left, slide right, move that cursor, fix that typo, and get on your way. *Android not required, but recommended. In the Pixel Launcher, if you start searching for an app within the app drawer and you don’t have it installed, tap "Search for more apps." It will automatically send that search into the Play Store, making it easy to install a missing app. Beyond the obvious stock Google programs, a few apps you can't live without right now (and a quick word about why): Twitter helps me stay connected and up to date on what is happening around me. Our world is shifting so fast, and Moments and Highlights help me get caught up. Slack is another app I check in with daily. It’s how I coordinate with the Material Podcast hosts and other groups. If you’re a mobile app designer or developer, you need Skala View in your workbench. It works with the companion Mac app Skala Preview to help you see a preview of your design in real-time. It’s a quick and simple tool that helps you see how a design looks and feels on a mobile device before you jump into a robust prototyping tool.

Name: Subject: Message: Google search now has card-based suggestions for all the best recipes Newsby Brian Reigh15 hours ago 229 4 Whether you’re looking for healthy vegan dip recipes or chicken wings drenched in buffalo sauce (which is more of my scene, tbh), the latest version of Google app’s got your back – with the latest update, you can search for all sorts of recipes, and it’ll give you step-by-step instructions as well as fresh new ideas. See also: Amazon Alexa can now help you prepare 60,000 recipes November 21, 2016 It seems Google search is getting smarter and smarter; it certainly is getting more convenient for mobile devices. Ever since Google introduced its card-based UI, things look more organized and are easier to spot. And the search giant is bringing a slew of recipes in that format. Now when you search on the Google app for a particular recipe, “you’ll see a carousel of tappable suggestions to make sure you catch the best recipe.” For instance, if you type in “Chicken wing recipes,” not only will Google gather various recipes from the web with scrumptious pictures, it will also give you suggestions for more specific types such as “Buffalo,” “Honey,” “Spicy,” or “Slow cooker.” If you tap on one of those keywords, Google will show you a list of cards, each from a different website, along with a preview of ingredients, reviews, calories, and how long it’d take to cook. Pretty neat, eh? Google will show you a list of cards, each from a different website, along with a preview of ingredients, reviews, calories, and how long it’d take to cook. So whether you are preparing for a party, in need of some inspiration, or just salivating at 2AM looking for some food porn, Google wants to be the place to go to for easy step-by-step recipes. If you haven’t done so already, give it a try – ranging from simple appetizers to full-blown Korean dishes, it should have a thing or two that pleases you.

How? SEO February 2, 2017 SEO Ron DodFebruary 2, 2017 221SHARES 484READS 221SHARES 484READS Ron Dod 221SHARES 484READS Author’s Note: I am not affiliated with Fashion Nova. All data citations come from SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Alexa. Screenshots and data are from January 29th, 2017, so by the time you are reading this, the rankings could be different. It was a Friday when I received an email from our Director of Business Development. He wanted me to take a look at a site called FashionNova.com and figure out why they ranked #1 for the keyword “Fashion.” Wait, what? “#1 for Fashion?” I’ve never even heard of them. How can that be? I looked them up to check it out and good lord — these guys are killing it right now. Here are some other keywords FashionNova.com also ranks for: #9 for Jeans (74,000 monthly searches) #7 for Jumpsuits (49,000 monthly searches) #6 for Denim Dress (33,000 monthly searches) You might be thinking, “Well, what good is being ranked #6 through #9?” However, here is the list of retailers ahead of them for the keyword jeans: Forever21, Levi’s, H&M, American Eagle, Hollister, Nordstrom, Macy’s, and Buckle. No big deal. To put this into perspective, here is their current employee count from LinkedIn: Here is Macy’s: 50 employees versus 10K+? It’s incredible this dark horse is able to rank so highly and compete with these huge retailers. I decided to dig deeper and figure out how they are “killing the game” right now in Google. Here is what I found: Link Profile Blind Resume As someone who values backlinks tremendously as a ranking factor, I believe backlinks can cure “SEO cancer.” Do you have terrible on-page optimization or a slow site? Backlinks will fix that! That said, here are blind resumes of backlink profiles from the results of a 30,000+ monthly searched keyword phrase in Google: Resume #1: Resume #2: Resume #3: Resume #4: Guess which one is Fashion Nova? If you guessed Resume #2 you are correct! Here are the results for the resumes: Resume #1: Sammydress.com Resume #2: Fashionnova.com Resume #3: US.Asos.com Resume #4: Macys.com This is just incredible. Their link profile is massively smaller than the others, yet they rank with them for the major keywords. This is very perplexing to me. How are they competing with everyone so much bigger than them? One thing we know so far: backlinks are not the reason they are ranking high in Google’s coveted real estate. On-page Optimization After looking at their backlink profile, I thought, “Well, they must have some killer on-page optimization.” But, once I dug in, I found that their on-page isn’t the best. It isn’t content on any of the category pages, and they don’t even have meta descriptions on them. In the screenshot below, you can see Google just populates random text in the description. One thing they do really well is tons of reviews on their product pages. Tip: If you are an online merchant, please set up reviews on your products and have a strategy to get your customers to write reviews on the products. You can see below that their products have a lot of good reviews. Google loves review content. Your customers are essentially doing SEO for you. This is a big reason Amazon does so well in search engines. With all of that being said, I would be shocked if their on-page optimization is one of the main ways they are ranking so highly in Google. Time to move on to other things that could be working in their favor. Social Media Following Before you grab your pitchforks about how social media does not help Google rankings, hear me out! It is true that Google’s former spam man, Matt Cutts, said Facebook and Twitter do not directly influence rankings. But, here is the thing — I don’t believe it. I am confident that social media signs do help SEO- but likely not in the way most SEOs envision it. Some tend to think of social media signals as backlinks: for example when someone tweets your blog. That might not help for SEO. However, there are other benefits that could help SEO, such as a customer finding your products on Instagram and then searching for it on Google. Google likes CTRs and usability, so I would imagine that if you have a legion of customers going from Instagram and searching for “Fashion Nova Denim Dress,” Google will figure out that searchers really like that page and, maybe, it would also be a good fit for the keyword phrase “Denim Dress.” Speaking of Instagram, let’s check out their profile and compare it to the other players: Now we are getting somewhere here. Their social media game is on fire. I am not sure how many of their Instagram followers are fake but having 6.3 million is impressive. This could be the largest contributing factor on why this site is  doing so well in search engines. Comparing Sites in Alexa With regards to Google giving preferential treatment to good usability, we should review comparable bounce rates as a factor. Here are the results from Alexa: Of course, this is Alexa which is extrapolating indirect data and is known to be inaccurate, but it gives us a reasonable and relative comparison. According to this metric, people are engaging with FashionNova.com more than the other two sites. It has a lower bounce rate and more time on site. If I had to bet on it, I would imagine this is another big factor on why Google is putting them at the top for major keywords. Conclusion This might be super frustrating to traditional SEOs. Heck, I am a little frustrated as well that they can just outrank everyone with no link profile and no real on-page optimization. But we need to realize this may the future of search engine optimization, and we need to start optimizing for factors outside of on-page optimization and off-page optimization (backlinks). Social media and good usability factors seem to be the most likely reason FashionNova.com is currently at the top for major keyword rankings. I hope you enjoyed this. Do you have any input to add? Please feel free send me a tweet. Image Credits Featured Image: Pixabay.com. Screenshots by Ronald Dod. Taken January 2017.

There it is. That deeply flawed slogan of the white hat SEO community — the ultimate over-simplification of what it takes to drive traffic to your website. Virtually every marketer under the sun has parroted this jargon at some point or another, ad nauseam. These are the words of a guilty man. We treat content as if it were some furtive MacGuffin — hiding in plain sight, capable of unlocking the secret kingdom of Google. Speaking as someone who authored some truly inspiring works on dental and plumbing services — downright award-worthy — I can tell you: This simply isn’t true. Search engine optimization is a game of inches. There is no silver bullet. Telling me the answer to all my burning questions about optimization is simply ‘produce great content’ — that seems woefully inadequate. It’s like shouting ‘follow the North Star!’ to someone stranded at sea; thanks, but those generalized directions only help so much. Let’s get specific. Here’s a bigger picture on how to boost your traffic. Prioritize Pages Earning organic traffic for a newly created website is serious work — but what about a site that’s been around for a few years? There’s a good chance older sites rank for some valuable keywords just off the first page of search results. Those keywords and their subsequent pages should be your top priority. Noted SEO expert Joe Laratro suggests these pages can easily be nudged in the right direction with 3-5 targeted external links. How you earn those links is entirely up to you — links from low-quality sources probably won’t cut it. Use a tool like SEMrush to see your current keyword rankings. You’re looking for anything just off the first page (positions 11-20). I suggest using this data to create your own resource to track this project. Mine looks like this … After you gather 3-5 links for that page, set up a reminder to check on the page’s rank in search results about two weeks later. This should be enough to reach the first page of search results in many cases, depending on the level of competition there. Obviously, scale accordingly. Refresh Your Content That publish date at the top of your content is hugely significant. I mean … probably (that’s my working theory). The more often you update your content, the more often your site is crawled, increasing your opportunities to rank. While Google has yet to come right out and declare that fresh content will springboard you into first page results, there’s plenty of evidence to believe that’s the case. Let’s consider this from a Google’s perspective. Search results are trending more real-time — for example, Google now regularly displays tweets and topical news whenever they apply. What does this mean for your site in Google? Perhaps it’s best interpreted like this: If your page doesn’t offer the latest and greatest information, you’re probably not the best source to provide an answer to my question. Expect to rank accordingly. This isn’t true across the board, of course. Search for something like ‘US Constitution’ and you’ll almost certainly receive the same results time and again. The base information for a topic like this doesn’t change all too often (if ever). Beyond observing trends, there’s some empirical evidence to suggest ‘freshness’ matters in SEO. The first bit to consider comes directly from the source: the Official Google Blog. In a post originally published in 2011 — in regards to Google’s Caffeine search index — the blog states, “Different searches have different freshness needs. This algorithmic improvement is designed to better understand how to differentiate between these kinds of searches and the level of freshness you need, and make sure you get the most up to the minute answers.” There’s some complexity here — as some case studies suggest, there’s more to consider than simply updating the publish date of your blog post. Cyrus Shepard illustrated several examples of how fresh content may influence Google rankings. To summarize a few key takeaways: New content receives a freshness score which decays over time The amount of content refreshed in the post matters Changes to key areas of the content are most significant While some pages of your site stand to benefit more than others, refreshing your content keeps it from gathering cobwebs and provides an edge in organic search. Take Control of Your Index “If you want to win the lottery you need to buy a ticket.” That’s a quote from Eric Enge which reflects his personal philosophy on indexing the contents of a website. Taken apart, what this essentially means is every page matters. Perhaps that’s an extreme view to take but more webmasters should really take this virtue to heart. After all, how many websites have you encountered that weren’t making use of Search Console? Many businesses have yet to take their site’s index into their own hands. Whether this is blissful ignorance or something entirely different, the consequence is the same: your optimization greatly suffers. Ignoring the technical side of your website is a bit like ignoring routine maintenance on your car.  Getting your oil changed regularly isn’t a friendly suggestion — it’s required. The first step to taking control starts with utilizing the full power of the Google Search Console. Among its many benefits, Search Console allows you to: Verify that Google can access your pages Instruct Google which pages to crawl/avoid Ensure the overall health of your site; check for crawl errors Make sure to read Google’s guide on managing your website with Search Console for more information. Content Still Matters Why is content so widely touted by search marketers as a sovereign authority in SEO? I personally believe it’s because SEO more closely resembles content marketing in recent years. Although this viewpoint helped ebb the rising tide of low-quality spam content, it’s similarly responsible for placing too much emphasis on a single aspect of SEO. That kind of tunnel vision isn’t helpful. This ‘content above all’ logic essentially maintains creating the most compelling and informative piece of content results in top rankings. The problem with that is not everyone is capable of just churning out a New York Times Best Seller — and Google certainly doesn’t expect that either. Okay, so content isn’t quite king — but it still matters a great deal. You don’t want to mail it in here if you truly value organic performance. Here are a few golden rules to keep in mind: Content should be written for users first Depth matters; shoot for 800-1000 words in your pages Don’t hesitate to link out to relevant sources; it might even help you receive reciprocal links Keep it mobile-friendly Need more help in this department? Learn more about optimizing your content for SEO the right way — make it a regular habit. Conclusion Content is not a cure-all for the ills of search engine marketing — it’s simply a cog in the greater machine, helping spin the wheel. For those of you that can’t be considered the Larry King of HVAC articles, hear this: You’re absolved. There are many avenues to success in the realm of SEO. Diversify your strategy and you’ll inevitably find your way. Image Credits Featured Image: klimkin/Pexels.com Screenshots by Tyler Thursby. Taken January 2017.

The value of software deals in 2016 topped $115 billion for acquisitions closed or pending, according to data gathered by Bloomberg. That’s up about 19 percent from 2015 and easily outpaced the growth of deals in the overall technology market, which was slightly down. And this year is already off to a strong start with Cisco Systems Inc. agreeing to acquire AppDynamics Inc. for $3.7 billion right as the company was planning to go public. Oracle Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. were among the bigger buyers in 2016, but this year companies that have been relatively quiet may step up, analysts say. They could include other important names in enterprise technology -- and potentially some of the biggest players in the broader industry: Google and Amazon.com Inc. The new Trump administration has talked about rewriting tax provisions that could return profits stored away in other countries, which would fuel the size and frequency of deals. And while blockbuster deals can be difficult to pull off, some see the potential for Google pursuing Salesforce. "There’s no question that’s it going to be an active year," said Crawford Del Prete, an analyst at IDC. "The stakes are just so high for these software companies to make sure that they stay relevant." Arete Research Services LLP, an influential research firm, issued a report arguing why Google parent Alphabet Inc. should make a big merger splash and buy Salesforce. The note says Google could nab it for around $73 billion, immediately giving its cloud business surer footing in enterprise sales. Such a deal would also have a better chance of passing regulatory muster than one in ads or search, according to the Arete analysts. It’s a radical proposal, but not implausible. Google is pouring nearly everything it has into the cloud. Since recruiting enterprise veteran Diane Greene in late 2015, Google has invested internal resources and acquisition coffers in her division, which includes its customized workplace apps and cloud storage service. Google and Salesforce both declined to comment. But not everyone thinks it’s a certainty. "I wouldn’t think this is particularly likely,"  said Jonathan Atkin, managing director of RBC Capital Markets. "But this is a way to jump-start their momentum they have in their cloud product. It’s an acquisition of a customer base, effectively." Amazon is also trying to grow its cloud business. It’s the largest player in the so-called public cloud, which lets customers easily rent computing and storage power at their data centers. Amazon declined to comment on potential acquisitions. "I think you’re going to start seeing them being more aggressive in 2017," said Sean Jacobsohn, a venture investor at Norwest Venture Partners. A potential change in tax laws could free up more spending money for a lot of players. U.S. companies have earned profits overseas for years, but have tucked them away in foreign countries to escape a U.S. tax rate of 35 percent. As long as the profits remain overseas, they remain untouched by the government. Yet Trump’s nominee for the U.S. Department of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, may give companies a new incentive. He said in November he wanted to bring “a lot of cash back to the U.S.,” proposing a one-time 10 percent repatriation tax to return corporate tax revenue held abroad, another key promise by Trump. "I expect that ’17 will be another big year in M&A, particularly if we get repatriation or a tax cut," said Joel Fishbein, an analyst at BTIG. "I think that will spur more M&A as some of those offshore dollars can be used for domestic acquisitions." There is a lot of corporate money overseas that could come back inside the country if Trump acts on taxes. Oracle and Microsoft have more than 80 percent of their cash, near-term cash and short-term investments in foreign subsidiaries, according to recent filings. The cash overseas held by large tech companies runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars, according to Ross MacMillan, an analyst with RBC, and that’s money companies may use to go shopping. Oracle and Microsoft declined to comment. Overall in 2016, the value of merger-and-acquisition business software deals totaled $117.6 billion-- and included a wide swath of software companies in technology sectors, along with some in health care and entertainment. That doesn’t include the blockbuster tech deal of the year: Microsoft paying $26 billion for LinkedIn. LinkedIn does not fit neatly into the category of business software because of its professional networking tools that are used by workers outside of business hours. Even without repatriation, companies are sitting on a lot of cash that can be used to finance deals. Cisco -- which has about $70 billion in cash and equivalents and investments overall -- saw opportunity to expand its business-software capabilities with the deal for AppDynamics, which had previously been valued at more than $1 billion, making it a so-called unicorn. It’s the biggest software acquisition for the company since 2012. The purchase is also significant because it derailed the first potential IPO of the year for a U.S. tech company. Now it’s seen by some advisers as the first in a long-expected wave of unicorn buyouts. With more than 150 companies valued at more than $1 billion and a temperamental IPO market, being acquired offers startups an exit from the funding roller coaster and can also shield them from the regulatory and investor scrutiny that comes with a public listing. "IPO investors still aren’t paying premiums, so M&A looks like an attractive option to private companies," according to Dan Scholnick, a general partner at Trinity Ventures. Unless IPO investors are willing "to pay up, the M&A trend will continue." Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up International Business Machines Corp., which recently reported its 19th consecutive quarter of sales decline, could gobble up smaller companies to reinvigorate growth as well. IBM declined to comment. SAP SE, a rival to Oracle and Salesforce, might also be on the hunt for cloud acquisition targets, analysts say. Its last big multibillion-deal came in 2014 when it spent more than $7 billion on Concur Technologies, which helps businesses manage travel expenses. Still, SAP, which declined to comment on specific future targets, signaled it will look at acquisitions under $1 billion. Still, there are several factors, analysts say, that could lead to a disappointing 2017 for deals. The Trump administration could fail to pass tax reform. And because 2016 was such a busy year, it may be difficult to keep up the pace; some of the acquirers will need time integrate their purchases. Some say that many of the interesting companies got picked up last year. "You did see a lot of good assets come off the table," said Rodney Nelson, an analyst at Morningstar. Not everything, though. Analysts say two big potential targets for companies looking to expand their cloud services are Workday Inc., a provider of human resources software, and ServiceNow, which helps companies manage technology and human resources tools. Both are relatively large with a valuation of about $15 billion. Both companies declined to comment. Other companies that might look like good buys include FireEye Inc., a security company; Hubspot Inc., a cloud-based marketing service; and Zendesk Inc., which serves call centers, according to Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.

The Global 500 predicts how much a firm’s brand is likely to be worth in terms of money and power over the coming months, based on categories including financial stability and sustainability.  It found that Google’s value had risen 24 per cent in the past year while Apple’s has dropped somewhat considerable by 27 per cent –yet still took second place. Google’s brand value is estimated at $109. 4 billion, while Apple is just behind at $107.1 billion. Amazon kept its third place position with a brand valuation of $106.4 billion, followed by AT&T at $87 billionn and Microsoft at $76.3 billion. Facebook claimed the ninth spot in the rankings with a value of just under $62 billion. In its research for “most powerful brand”, Global 500 put Lego at number 1, with its expanded ventures into movies, TV content, gaming and theme parks having proved fruitful indeed for the Danish company. The Walt Disney company, last years’ number 1, slid to 6th place whilst Google took 2nd spot.

 MIT designed a cubicle that comes down from the ceiling for Google's open offices Leanna Garfield Feb. 2, 2017, 12:12 PM 3,067 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Transformable Meeting Space. MIT Self-Assembly Lab/Google/Michelle Kaufmann Like many companies, Google has opted for an open layout in its Silicon Valley headquarters.  But since there are no cubicles, it can be hard to find a quiet space to get work done or to conduct important phone calls. To solve this issue, Google consulted MIT to create a giant cubicle, called the Transformable Meeting Space, that comes down from the ceiling. MIT's team also worked with architect Michelle Kaufmann, who is running the Research and Development Lab for Google and Alphabet's campus set to open in 2018. By maneuvering a lightweight pulley, Googlers can make the Transformable Meeting Space wrap around them. Measuring about 10 feet in diameter, it was installed at Google's San Francisco office in late 2016. "We were going after the challenge of office environments, where there are totally open spaces. They were trendy, but now there's a bit of a backlash on them," MIT's Skylar Tibbits tells Business Insider. "It's great because you can have privacy in fixed offices; but it's also not great, because you can't have flexibility or different functions." He's the founder of MIT's Self-Assembly Lab, which created Google's Transformable Meeting Space and experiments with "4D materials" that can transform, adapt, and assemble entirely by themselves. In December 2016, Tibbits published a book that details the impact and future of 4D technology. 4D materials aren't robotic. They use natural elements — like changes in temperature, pressure, and moisture — to transform or even repair themselves.  The Transformable Meeting Space. MIT Self-Assembly Lab/Google/Michelle Kaufmann Tibbits compares the Transformable Meeting Space to a Chinese finger trap because of the way that it morphs. The counter-weights help change the shape of the structure, which is made primarily of braided fiber glass and partially blocks outside noise. Its frame changes shape like a puppet, just by pulling a few ropes. MIT's Self-Assembly team is working on all kinds of similar projects. It has also built a system for cell phone parts that can self-assemble, orthodontic braces that can automatically move teeth, and an Ikea-style table that can build itself in a few seconds. The Lab collaborates with companies from various industries, including medicine, aerospace, and automotive, to create these systems. Tibbits sees them as cost-effective alternatives to traditional robotics. "Today, if companies want to make something smart, they tend to just turn it into a robot," he says. "The problem is that costs a lot, it fails often, it adds assembly time, and complexity." These materials could make manufacturing more efficient in coming years, especially in consumer electronics. In the case of the self-building cell phone, the device's magnetic parts bounce around in a tumbler. Almost like magic, the pieces find each other to form the cell phone without human intervention. Google's Transformable Meeting Space was one of the more mechanical prototypes the team has designed. "It doesn't need temperature or moisture or sunlight to activate it, but it geometrically transforms," Tibbits says.

The plaintiff has also sought removal of trial court order records which mention him.Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt (C) arrives for a meeting over "right to be forgotten" issue in Madrid. (Reuters photo) NEW DELHI: There is no reason for creation of a separate legal framework under 'right to be forgotten' to delink 'irrelevant information' from the Internet, Google Inc told Delhi High Court on Thursday. The submission was made in an affidavit placed before Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva by Google which has contended that even if it disables or blocks a site in its search engine, that webpage will remain on the original website and would be accessible on other search engines. This view was also echoed by the court while hearing an NRI's plea seeking he be "delinked" from information regarding a criminal case involving his wife in which he was not a party. He has also sought removal from the records of the trial court order which mentions him. "If you post something on social media, it will never get deleted," the court said and added if the man's plea was allowed then all courts may have to destroy their records in matrimonial disputes. In his petition, filed through advocates Rohit Madan and Zoheb Hussain, the NRI has claimed the online availability of the criminal case, despite it being settled amicably, affects his right to privacy and reputation apart from affecting his employment opportunities. His petition has raised the question "whether data controllers or intermediaries such as Google, are required to delete information that is inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant if they receive a request for removal of such data". Claiming that the plea was not maintainable against it or its Indian entity, Google has said, "If a content is adjudicated to be defamatory or its goes beyond the principles of law of privacy, same can be directed to be removed pursuant to being adjudicated by the court. "However, there is no reason or justification for creation of a separate statute or legal framework under right to be forgotten." Google has also said that the petitioner should have approached the trial court, which had passed the order, to seek confidentiality and non-reporting of the order. The company has contended that the petition is not only "misconceived" but also "legally untenable". The court, meanwhile, asked the Centre to state its stand on whether such information can be de-linked from the Internet and listed the matter for further hearing on April 24.

Late last year the company added support for 30 new services and games, and recently, that list has quietly expanded. Google’s entire ecosystem surrounding Home and Assistant is still in its infancy, with developer channels barely having been open for two months. However, there’s another way to look at that. In just two months, Google has approved over 70 apps and services for the Home ─ 73 to be exact. That list includes popular options like Uber and Dominos, as well as dozens of smaller, third party apps which come in handy. Ask Wonder Some examples I’ve found useful include “Ask Wonder,” which can remember information you tell it and bring it back up with a quick request. You might ask it to remember birthdays, codes, passwords, and other various bits of information. To use the app, simply say something along the lines of “OK Google, talk to wonder.” Genius If you’ve ever had a song stuck in your head, you’ll find the app ‘Genius’ pretty useful. Simply say “OK Google, let me talk to Genius” followed by “What’s the song that goes [insert song fragment].” Just a couple seconds later, Genius will relay the title of that song, as well as the artist. In my tests, I’ve found it really reliable and accurate, even for more obscure songs. Argus ‘Argus’ is another service I find interesting. The health tracking service links back to the Android app and allows Google Home to relay information on step counting, sleep quality, and even weight tracking. It’s probably not for everyone, but it can certainly come in handy. AutoVoice Another app that really stands out is ‘AutoVoice.’ We covered this more in-depth earlier this week, but in short, AutoVoice is essentially an IFTTT for Google Home, that affects your smartphone directly. If you’ve got a solid knowledge of Tasker, the possibilities for this app are quite literally endless. AndChill ‘AndChill’ is notable given Google Home’s focus on entertainment. With this app, users can find recommendations for movies that they’d love. The app will ask you to state a movie you already like, and then what you like about it. Once you’ve given it that information, the app will find a couple of movies that you would probably like based on those factors. If that movie is on Netflix, you could then ask Google to cast it to your TV. Just for fun, I have to point out two amusing little apps now available for Home. The first is ‘Best Dad Jokes,’ which is exactly what you’d think. Stupid, but sometimes hilarious jokes played via the Home. Along with that, there’s a ‘Star Wars Facts’ app. Enough said. And that just scratches the surface. Obviously, not every app for Google Home is or will be useful, but as the list expands, more and more apps are making their debut and closing the gap between the Home, and the Echo.

The data reflect safety-related incidents reported by 11 companies that have been testing more than 100 vehicles on public roads, primarily in the Silicon Valley neighborhoods where the technology has grown up. The reports were made to California's Department of Motor Vehicles, which posted them online. The documents catalog the number of times from December 2015 through the end of November that humans took over control from a car's software for safety reasons. Waymo, as Google's self-driving car project was recently rebranded, did far more testing than the other 10 companies combined — and had much greater success. Its fleet drove itself more than 635,000 miles with 124 safety-related "disengagements," which must be reported when the technology fails or the backup driver takes control out of concern the car is malfunctioning. The Google project's disengagement rate was the equivalent of two incidents every 10,000 miles, a notable decrease over the prior year, when there were eight disengagements per 10,000 miles. "This four-fold improvement reflects the significant work we've been doing to make our software and hardware more capable and mature," Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo's head of self-driving technology wrote in a blog post . Waymo's chief critic acknowledged the improvement, but John Simpson of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog said the number of disengagements shows the cars still "simply aren't ready to be released to roam our roads" without human backup drivers. Other companies also showed improvements. Nissan reported 28 disengagements over 4,099 miles, or 68 incidents per 10,000 miles — far better than the 106 in 1,485 miles (713 per 10,000 miles) it reported last year. Cruise Automation, a startup acquired last year by General Motors, reported driving the second most test miles this year. Cruise said its prototypes had 181 disengagements over 9,776 miles (185 per 10,000 miles) and that it was "pleased with our progress" during testing on the complex streets of San Francisco. The company did not file numbers for 2015 because it did not have a testing permit that year. Though imperfect, the data represent the best peek the public gets into the secretive and fiercely competitive world of self-driving cars and how the prototypes are performing. California required the disengagement reports as part of regulations governing testing on public roads. Separately, the state also requires companies to report any collisions involving its cars. When the technology will be ready for the public depends on several factors, including regulators' readiness and company confidence the vehicles are safe. While Tesla's Elon Musk has been bullish, talking about months rather than years, companies such as Waymo have suggested 2017 or 2018 is more realistic. Tesla's disengagement report said four prototypes drove a total of 550 miles last fall, experiencing 182 disengagements — the equivalent of 3,309 disengagements every 10,000 miles. Tesla logged the miles primarily to develop a publicly posted video , set to the Rolling Stones song "Paint It Black," of the driver's seat perspective in a car where a person does not have to put their hands on the wheel or feet on the pedals. The video promoted how Tesla was shipping cars with advanced sensors that will be activated in the future. Generally, Tesla tests on private land, not public roads. Those disengagements are not reported to the state. Meanwhile, Tesla is gathering tens of millions of miles of real-world data when owners engage the current Autopilot feature, which can control steering and speed but is not sophisticated enough to make the cars self-driving from the regulatory perspective. California's Department of Motor Vehicles has been working for several years on regulations that will govern how the technology can be rolled out to the public when companies believe testing shows it is ready. The state expects to release final "public operation" regulations within six weeks, according to Melissa Figueroa, a spokeswoman for California's State Transportation Agency. The Department of Motor Vehicles, which is part of the agency, made public a first draft in December 2015, nearly a year after final rules were supposed to be in place. The department has since revised the language based on developments at the federal level and input from industry and other groups. The agency and the department declined comment on the reports released Wednesday. ___ Data journalist Angeliki Kastanis in Los Angeles contributed.

Read all about it below: Related articles Today's channel rundown - 2 February 2017 Today's channel rundown - 12 January 2017 Today's channel rundown - 23 August 2016 Today's channel rundown - 26 August 2016 Carbonite's Double-Take buyout Backup and recovery vendor Carbonite has acquired Double-Take Software from Vision Solutions for $65.25 million in cash and stock, the company has announced. Vision Solutions, a portfolio company of Clearlake Capital, bought Double-Take in 2010 for $242 million. Carbonite said the acquisition adds high availability technology to its existing suite of data protection solutions for SMBs. Double-Take's 140 employees will be added to about 850 workers at Carbonite. Meanwhile, Carbonite also announced preliminary fiscal 2016 revenue of $206.5 million to $207 million and Q4 revenue of $53 million to $53.5 million, with both figures ahead of its prior guidance. The company is expecting to post a $0.13 to $0.15 EPS loss for the full year. Smartphones' 2016 growth Global smartphone shipments grew three percent annually to hit a record 1.5 billion units in 2016, according to researcher Strategy Analytics' latest figures. For Q4, shipment totals rose nine percent from last year to 430 million units, turning in the segment's fastest growth rate in more than a year, driven by stronger demand in major developing markets, the analyst said. Apple's iPhone led all models, with 18 percent global smartphone market share for Q4, while Oppo grew 99 percent annually, more than any other vendor. Apple shipped 78.3 million smartphones worldwide during the quarter for a five percent climb from Q4 2015. Samsung shipped 77.5 million smartphones worldwide in Q4 2016, dipping five percent annually from last year, largely owing to its Note 7 fallout, Strategy Analytics said. Google's Chrome iOS Google has announced that Chrome for iOS has now been open-sourced similarly to Chrome for other platforms, and has also been moved into the open-source repository. "Historically, the code for Chrome for iOS was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform," the company said in a blog posted on its Chromium page. Chromium is the open source web browser project that has much of the same code as Google Chrome. Meanwhile, Google warned users that Gmail will only continue to function on Chrome 53 and below through the end of the year. Users who stick with Chrome 53 and earlier versions could be redirected to the basic HTML version of Gmail as early as December 2017, the company said in a separate blog post. Uptake's $40 million Cloud-based predictive analytics startup Uptake has landed a $40 million funding round from Revolution Growth, the venture firm has announced in a blog post. Uptake, which was established in 2014 by Groupon founders Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, previously raised a $45 million funding round from GreatPoint Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Caterpillar and Lightbank to raise its valuation to $1.1 billion as of October, 2015. The new investment now values Uptake at $2 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. As part of the capital infusion, Revolution co-founder Ted Leonsis will join Uptake's board of directors. Microsoft's Windows 10 Cloud Microsoft has reportedly included an unannounced version of Windows 10 packed inside some of the recent Insider test builds, ZDNet reports. Windows 10 Cloud is apparently a pared down version of Windows 10 that will be able to run only Unified Windows Platform apps installed from the Windows Store, the report said. The streamlined OS will reportedly be positioned against Chromebooks. In an ironic twist, the platform's Windows 10 Cloud name appears to have nothing to do with the cloud, the report said. Samsung's Android tablet Samsung will reportedly showcase an Android 7.0 Nougat-based tablet at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. The company has scheduled a press conference for the day before the event, which runs from from 27 February to 2 March, teasing a new tablet in the invitations. The surprise is likely the Galaxy Tab S3, which would be Samsung's first Android tablet since debuting the Tab S2 two years ago.  It is said to sport a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM and a 9.6-inch, 2048 × 1536 display, Ars Technica reports. Samsung has already said it won't be showing the Galaxy S8 at the conference. Siemens' Q1 bump German conglomerate Siemens AG has recorded Q1 2017 net income of 1.94 billion euros ($2.09 billion), for a 25 percent hike from the 1.56 billion euros ($1.7 billion) it earned at the same time last year. Basic EPS rose 24 percent to 2.35 euros ($2.53). On a nominal basis, revenue grew one percent to 19.12 billion euros ($20.6 billion), while on a comparable basis, revenue climbed by three percent. Siemens shareholders urged CEO Joe Kaeser to continue his strategy to transform the company's engineering group, Reuters reports. The company's industrial business posted a 26 percent year-over-year climb in profits to 2.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion).

Published on February 02, 2017. Credit: iStock Most Popular The digital advertising ecosystem comprises an unlevel playing field vastly favoring the duopoly of Google and Facebook. Controlling 85% of media spend and 80% of referral traffic to independent publishers, this duopoly sets the rules and uses undue influence. Publishers and marketers alike reinforce the walled gardens of these duopolies, enabling the continued growth of these two companies, while simultaneously eroding their own revenue and ability to compete. How did we get here? Google and Facebook earned massive user bases before they even figured out their business models. But once they did, what they offered marketers was tremendously appealing: a large, logged-in user base (across multiple devices) with a treasure trove of addressable audience data, as well as massive scale within a well-lit environment, executed within a single technology stack that provides minimal data loss. For marketers looking to reach specific people or audiences, these platforms are a giant "easy button," and the reason they're on every digital media plan. In stark contrast are the independent publishers. While these publishers, comprising the third-party ecosystem, arguably offer the same data, scale and capabilities, it's broadly fragmented across a landscape of publishers, partners and technology platforms. Every publisher has a mere slice of comparable audience scale, with a much smaller portion of that audience logging in at all, much less logging in via multiple devices. Audience data is broadly fragmented too. Individual publishers posses a slice of comparable audience behavior, demographics, interests or shopping intentions, compared to the walled gardens. Additionally, transactions are executed via a slew of third-party technology vendors and addressable audience pools. While there is a common audience across all independent publishers, its addressability is fragmented across hundreds of proprietary identifiers, involving complex integrations and resulting in data loss that reduces scale of audience-based buying by more than 50%. What can we do to fix this? Fortunately, we have some of the critical pieces in place today that enable buyers and sellers to change this dynamic. Real-time bidding and header bidding have standardized and democratized access to audiences at scale, and we have a rich set of vendors that are already working closely together to form an open ecosystem. Publishers are formalizing coops to aggregate their data and audiences -- although the execution is still awkward, inefficient and in its early phases. Additionally, private marketplaces enable buyers and sellers to negotiate directly, with guarantees available. But these are still early days. The key missing leg of the stool, and the greatest opportunity, is for the industry to align around a standardized ID for addressable audiences on the web. Google has its user ID, which forms the basis for every digital advertising activity -- data collection, ad targeting, measurement, attribution and even cross-device. So does Facebook. These companies protect these IDs and all the key activities and learnings from them from leaving their respective walled gardens. As a buyer, you cannot place advertising on Google and Facebook, optimize your spend against those audiences, and then port those learnings and that spend to other platforms. It's like Hotel California: you can check-out any time you like, but you can never leave! In order for enable a viable option to the walled gardens, the industry needs to embrace a standardized user ID for web experiences, so that all buyers and sellers speak the same language outside of the duopoly. Instead of Google and Facebook and thousands of fragmented proprietary IDs, the industry needs a single industry ID for the all publishers and platforms not called Google or Facebook. This is not a new idea. Others have tried it. But nobody has tried it as a not-for-profit consortium built through an IAB Working Group. Nor is this a controversial idea. It benefits all players, without harming Google or Facebook materially. Leveling the playing field with a first party, standardized user ID benefits sellers, buyers and consumers alike. It's time.

The work has taken several years to complete, owing to the complexity of Chrome's iOS app. Google Chrome's desktop edition is built on top of Google's Chromium project, an open-source browser engine that anyone can contribute to. Until now, Chrome for iOS hasn't been part of Chromium though, due to the limitations of Apple's mobile platform. Apple requires all iOS web browsers to be based on the WebKit rendering engine. Because Chrome is based on Blink, Google had to create a new version of the browser's core that's compatible with WebKit for iOS. Traditionally, the two versions have been kept separate. Google has now folded them together in the Chromium code base though, allowing the iOS app to be open-sourced. Google has spent years preparing the iOS code for its move into the open-source Chromium repository. Because Chromium now needs to support both Blink and WebKit, additional complexities were introduced that have taken time to resolve. However, the project is now complete, extending Chrome's already strong support of open-source communities. "Given Chrome's commitment to open-source code, we've spent a lot of time over the past several years making the changes required to upstream the code for Chrome for iOS into Chromium," said Google. "Today, that upstreaming is complete, and developers can compile the iOS version of Chromium like they can for other versions of Chromium." According to Google, development speed has been increased as a result of the change because tests written for the iOS app are now available globally from anywhere in Chromium. This will simplify the creation of future cross-platform features, giving Chrome more unification across device ecosystems. Although open-sourcing the app doesn't directly impact users, it is an important milestone that shouldn't be overlooked. The iOS version of Chrome can now be pulled apart from developers outside of Google. With more pairs of eyes looking through the code, security issues could be discovered more quickly. Currently, Chrome for iOS tends to receive updates less frequently than the version for Android phones. This may also change as a result of the code being open-sourced since third-party programmers will be able to contribute new releases. Chrome for Android was open-sourced in May 2015. The change could also inspire the creation of more web browsers for iOS, giving consumers more choice when picking new apps. Developers interested in building a browser can now base their code on Chrome's, providing a quick starting point with all the basic infrastructure already implemented. The code for Chrome for iOS can now be browsed and searched in Google's online repositories. The company said it will continue to support open-source communities going forward, thanking Chromium contributors to date for participating. "We value the open source community and all of our contributors, and we're that glad that Chrome for iOS can finally join in," said Google.
