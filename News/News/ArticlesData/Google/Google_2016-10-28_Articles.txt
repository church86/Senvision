The unlock tool called dePixel8 has been released and is available for free.  ( Google ) Advertisement While Google has previously announced that the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones purchased from its store are bootloader unlocked, those exclusively sold by Verizon have been denied such feature. The carrier, however, has been beaten in that game as developers have successfully cracked its bootloader. Two developers registered at XDA as beaups and jcase, who are also behind the SunShine bootloader unlock tool, claimed to have discovered a method to pry the bootloader in the Verizon Pixel phones open. The method was in the form of the dePixel8 tool, which can work not just for Verizon Pixel phones but also for EE in the United Kingdom. Unlike previous unlock tools, which rely on scripts that can automatically unlock Android bootloader, the solution merely bypasses the security mechanisms that the carrier has embedded in it. The bootloader unlocking process is straightforward. A user only needs to install fastboot and adb on a PC, which will then enable the user to issue three commands that forces the phone to unlock the bootloader. During this process, another command has to be typed: "fastboot flashing unlock". Once this has been entered, an unlock bootloader option will be available. The entire affair is reportedly so easy that it is barely fun for beaups and jcase. The good news is that the dePixel8 is available for free. The only potential drawback is that the developers will not provide any form of support or, at least not obligated to provide one. What this means is that Pixel users cannot expect help if something goes wrong. Here, it is also helpful to note a key disclaimer: it is not the developer's best work. dePixel8 is released for HTC Pixel phones. Its not my best work, but it works..usually https://t.co/wTtXLBbW4f  @jcase @TheRootNinja — beaups (@firewaterdevs) October 28, 2016 The SunShine workaround could embolden a group of Pixel owners to unlock their bootloaders because this process effectively opens a Pixel smartphone to a host of new functionalities. This is primarily demonstrated in the way a new custom ROM could be flashed into the device. Those who are new to unlocking their phones' bootloader, however, are better served if they try to learn about Android SDK and commands. There are numerous sources available online that can help in this area. If users encounter problems or, worse, have bricked their devices in the process, there is no need to worry. Google has just released the Pixel phones' factory images that will let them manually restore their handsets to their original state. Verizon has not issued any statement regarding this issue. There is also no available information whether the carrier is working to address how dePixel8 bypasses its security mechanisms around the Pixel phones bootloader. Unlocked devices, however, will no longer receive the seamless updates feature in Android 7.0 Nougat.

Every business, no matter the size or industry, has a website that usually includes webpages listing the key products and services it's trying to sell. Most also have other pages devoted to targeted content the organization needs surfaced more prominently in Google's search results than its competitors. That's what the "optimization" part of SEO is looking to accomplish, and it's a nitty-gritty game of keyword and research-driven leapfrog, made significantly more complicated by Google changing all the rules every few months. That's where SEO tools come in. The emphasis on tools, meaning plural, is important. There's no one magical way to plop your website atop every single search results page, at least not organically. If you want to buy a paid search ad spot, Google AdWords will happily take your money. But to win for the more valuable and customer-trusted organic search spots, a balanced and comprehensive SEO strategy is a must-have. This can be broken down into three primary categories: ad hoc keyword research, ongoing search position monitoring, and crawling. In this roundup, we'll explain what each of those categories means for your business, the types of platforms and tools you can use to cover all of your SEO bases, and what to look for when investing in those tools. Breaking Down the SEO Tool Landscape The first wave of our roundup covers five top, self-service SEO tools: Ahrefs, KWFinder.com, Moz Pro, SEMrush, and SpyFu. The primary function of these tools falls primarily under keyword-focused SEO. When deciding what search topics to target and how best to focus your SEO efforts, treating keyword querying like an investigative tool is where you'll likely get the best results. These cloud-based, self-service tools have plenty of other unique optimization features as well. Some also do search position monitoring while others have more interactive data visualizations or crawling capabilities. The more powerful platforms can sport deeper analytics on paid advertising and pay-per-click (PPC) SEO as well. Though, at their core, the tools are all rooted in their ability to perform on-demand keyword queries. We concentrated on the keyword-based aspect of these SEO tools because that's where most business users will primarily focus. Monitoring particular keywords and your existing URL positions in search rankings is important, but once you've set that up it's largely an automated process. Automated position-monitoring features are a given in most SEO platforms and will alert you to issues, but they don't actively improve your search position. When your business has an idea about a new search topic for which you think your content has the potential to rank highly, the ability to spin up a query and investigate right away is key. Even more importantly, the tool should give you enough data points, guidance, and recommendations to confirm whether that particular keyword, or a related keyword or search phrase, is an SEO battle worth fighting, and, if so, how to win. We'll get into the factors and metrics to help you make those decisions a little further down. Click infographic for full view. Copyright: Third Door Media. Written by Search Engine Land, Design by Column Five Crawlers are largely a separate product category. There is some overlap with the self-service keyword tools (Ahrefs, for instance, does both), but crawling is another important piece of the puzzle we'll explore in greater depth with the second wave of reviews in this roundup. There are two types of crawling, both of which provide useful data. Internet-wide crawlers are for large-scale link indexing. It's a complicated and often expensive process but, as with social listening, the goal is ultimately for SEO experts, business analysts, and entrepreneurs to map how websites link to one another and extrapolate larger SEO trends and growth opportunities. Crawling tools generally do this with automated bots continuously scanning the web. As is the case with most of these SEO tools, many businesses use internal reporting features in tandem with integrated business intelligence (BI) tools to identify even deeper data insights. Website-specific crawlers, or software that crawls one particular website at a time, are great for analyzing your own website's SEO strengths and weaknesses and arguably even more useful for scoping out the competition. Website crawlers analyze a website's URL, link structure, images, CSS scripting, and associated apps and third-party services to evaluate SEO. Not unlike how a website monitoring tool scans for a webpage's overall "health," website crawlers can identify factors such as broken links and errors, website lag, and content or metadata with low keyword density and SEO value while mapping a website's architecture. Website crawlers can help your business improve website user experience (UX) while identifying key areas of improvement to help pages rank better. The last piece of the complicated SEO tool ecosystem is the enterprise tier. This roundup is geared toward SEO at the small to midsize businesses (SMBs) level for which these platforms are likely priced out of reach. But the handful of enterprise SEO software providers out there essentially roll all of the self-service tools into one comprehensive platform that combines ongoing position monitoring, deep keyword research, and crawling with customizable reports and analytics. The enterprise platforms can also tie in larger content marketing campaigns and return-on-investment (ROI) metrics for integrated digital marketing teams. We may look at enterprise-tier SEO platforms in future reviews but, for SMBs, a smart combination of self-service tools is the much better bang for your SEO buck. Running the Numbers Evaluating which self-service SEO tools are best suited to your business incorporates a number of factors, features, and SEO metrics. Ultimately, though, when we talk about "optimizing," it all comes down to how easy the tool makes it to get, understand, and take action on the SEO data you need. Particularly when it comes to ad hoc keyword investigation, it's about the ease with which you can zero in on the ground where you can make the most progress. In business terms, that means making sure you're targeting the most opportune and effective keywords available in your industry or space—the words for which your customers are searching. The terms SEO experts often start with are page authority (PA) and domain authority (DA). DA, a concept in fact coined by Moz, is a 100-point scale that predicts how well a website will rank on search engines. PA is the modern umbrella term for what started as Google's original PageRank algorithm, developed by co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google still uses PageRank internally but has gradually stopped supporting the increasingly irrelevant metric, which it now rarely updates. PA is the custom metric each SEO vendor now calculates independently to gauge and rate (again, on a scale of 100) the link structure and authoritative strength of an individual page on any given domain. That's why PA and DA metrics often vary from tool to tool. Each ad hoc keyword tool we tested came up with slightly different numbers based on what they're pulling from Google and other sources, and how they're doing the calculating. The shortcoming of PA and DA is that, even though they give you a sense of how authoritative a page might be in the eyes of Google, they don't tell you how easy or difficult it will be to position it for a particular keyword. This difficulty is why a third, newer metric is beginning to emerge among the self-service SEO players: difficulty scores. Difficulty scores are the SEO market's answer to the patchwork state of all the data out there. All five tools we tested stood out because they do offer some version of a difficulty metric,or one holistic 1-100 score of how difficult it would be for your page to rank organically (without paying Google) on a particular keyword. Difficulty scores are inherently subjective and each tool calculates it uniquely. In general, it incorporates PA, DA, and other factors, including search volume on the keyword, how heavily paid search ads are influencing the results, and how the strong the competition is in each spot on the current search results page. It's exceedingly easy as an SEO team to spin your wheels trying to optimize a term into which your business will never be able to break. Difficulty scores quantify that potential opportunity versus risk proposition into one number, which is why we spent a lot of time in this roundup testing how effectively each tool represented keyword difficulty. For example, let's say the keyword difficulty of a particular term is in the 80s and 90s in the top five spots on a particular search results page. Then, in positions 6-9, the difficulty scores drop down into the 50s and 60s. Using that difficulty score, a business can begin targeting that range of spots and running competitive analysis on the pages to see who your website could knock out of their spot. It All Comes Back to Google The caveat in all of this is that, in one way or another, most of the data and the rules governing what ranks and what doesn't (often on a week-to-week basis) comes from Google. If you know where to find and how to use the free and freemium tools Google provides under the surface—AdWords, Google Analytics, and Google Search Console (formerly Webmaster Tools) being the big three— you can do all of this manually. Much of the data the ongoing position monitoring, keyword research, and crawler tools provide is extracted in one form or another from Google itself. Doing it yourself is a disjointed, meticulous process, but you can piece together all the SEO data you need to come up with an optimization strategy should you be so inclined. As Google tweaks its algorithms, tools, and search engine policies, so goes the SEO industry. The AdWords API is still the foundation of much of the data with which SEO tools work. Google used to make much of its ad-hoc keyword search functionality available as well, but now the Keyword Planner is behind a pay-wall in AdWords as a premium feature. Difficulty scores are inspired by the way Google calculates its Competition Score metric in AdWords, though most vendors calculate difficulty using PA and DA numbers correlated with search engine positions, without AdWords data blended in at all. Search Volume is a different matter, and is almost always directly lifted from AdWords. Not to mention keyword suggestions and related keywords data, which in many tools come from Google's Suggest API. Platforms also made use of the unofficial Autocomplete API before Google shut it down last year. An SEO expert could probably use a combination of AdWords for the initial data, Google Search Console for website monitoring, and Google Analytics for internal website data. Then transform and analyze it using all a BI tool. The problem for most business users is that's simply not an effective use of time and resources. These tools exist to take the manual data gathering and granular, piecemeal detective work out of SEO. It's about making a process that's core to modern business success more easily accessible to someone who isn't an SEO consultant or expert. Where the free Google tools can provide complementary value is in fact-checking. If you're checking out more than one of these SEO tools, you'll quickly realize this isn't an exact science. If you were to look at the PA, DA, and keyword difficulty scores across KWFinder, Moz, SpyFu, SEMrush, and Ahrefs for the same set of keywords, you might get different numbers across each metric separated by anywhere from a few points to dozens. If your business is unsure about an optimization campaign on a particular keyword, you can cross-check with data straight from a free AdWords account and Search Console. Another trick: enable Incognito mode in your browser along with an extension like the free Moz Toolbar and you can run case-by-case searches on specific keywords to get an organic look at your target search results page. The SEO tools in this roundup provide tremendous digital marketing value for businesses, but it's important not to forget that we're living in Google's world under Google's constantly evolving rules. Oh and don't forget to check the tracking data on Bing now and again, either. Google's the king, but the latest ComScore numbers have Bing market share sitting at 22.1 percent. How To Choose Your SEO Tool Suite When it comes to finally choosing the SEO tools that suit your organization's needs, the decision comes back to that concept of gaining tangible ground. It's about discerning which tools provide the most effective combination of keyword-driven SEO investigation capabilities, and then on top of that the added keyword organization, analysis, recommendations, and other useful functionality to take action on the SEO insights you uncover. If a product is telling you what optimizations need to be made to your website, does it then provide technology to help you make those improvements? The self-service SEO tools we tested all handle pricing relatively similarly, pricing by month with discounts for annual billing with most SMB-focused plans ranging in the $50-$200 per month range. Depending on how your business plans to use the tools, the way particular products delineate pricing might make more sense. KWFinder.com is the cheapest of the bunch but it's focused squarely on ad-hoc keyword and Google search results page (SERP) queries, which is why the product sets quotas for keyword lookups per 24 hours at different tiers. Moz and Ahrefs price by campaigns or projects, meaning the number of websites you're tracking in the dashboard. Most of the tools also cap the number of keyword reports you can run per day. SpyFu prices a bit differently, providing unlimited data access and results but capping the number of sales leads and domain contacts. For the purposes of our testing, we standardized keyword queries across the five tools. To test the primary ad-hoc keyword search capability with each tool, we ran queries on an identical set of keywords. From there we tested not only the kinds of data and metrics the tool gave, but how it handled keyword management and organization, and what kind of optimization recommendations and suggestions the tool provided. Enterprise SEO platforms put all of this together—high-volume keyword monitoring with premium features like landing page alignments and optimization recommendations, plus on-demand crawling and ongoing position monitoring—but they're priced by custom quote. While the top-tier platforms give you features like in-depth keyword expansion and list management, and bells and whistles like SEO recommendations in the form of automated to-do lists, SMBs can't afford to drop thousands of dollars per month. The tools we tested in this round of reviews were judged on which do the best job of giving you the research-driven investigation tools to identify SEO opportunities ripe for growth, along with offering enterprise-grade functionality at a reasonable price. Whether one of these optimization tools is an ideal fit for your business, or you end up combining more than one for a potent SEO tool suite, this roundup will help you decide what makes the most sense for you. There's a wealth of data out there to give your business an edge and boost pages higher and higher in key search results. Make sure you've got the right SEO tools in place to seize the opportunities.

Some handsets could see the OS on their mobile devices by the year's end.  ( Gabriel Grams | Getty Images ) Advertisement Google has been rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat steadily across devices, and now fans of the operating system are wondering when the OS will land on the Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 family. Insiders familiar with the matter point out that the firmware will reach eligible handsets much quicker than it happened during the switch to Android Marshmallow, and we may see the aforementioned devices get it as early as December 2016. A number of reports note that Samsung will push Android 7.0 Nougat into the S7, S6 and Note 5 during the fourth quarter of this year, meaning that owners of the devices could see an update notification between now and December. Android 7.0 Nougat Update Schedule Google might first release the beta variant of the firmware to a number of flagships, followed by a full release on a larger scale. At the time of writing, no official word is out about a final version update roadmap. However, it seems that users have spotted the Samsung Galaxy S7 operating Android 7.0 Nougat on GFXBench. Should the rumors hold water, it means that Google is pooling resources to get the OS update into as many phones as possible. Additional reports hint that the sweet Google firmware is undergoing testing in Poland, on both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. In other news, XDA Developers observed that Android 7.0 Nougat could ramp up the capabilities of the Galaxy Note 5's stylus. Other reports suggest that Samsung is looking into overhauling the TouchWiz UI, which Samsung could improve by bringing Grace UX to the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. As a reminder, Grace UX was part of the explosive Galaxy Note 7. People familiar with the update process claim that Samsung might roll out the firmware first to the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S7 then to more devices. Which Samsung Galaxy Smartphones Will Receive Android Nougat Update? Here is the full list of handsets that should carry the multi-feature, well-commended OS from Google: Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Ironman edition, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy S6 Active and Galaxy S6 edge+. Additionally, the S7 family will tap into Nougat's potential, as Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, Galaxy S7 Batman edition, Galaxy S7 Active and Galaxy S7 Olympic edition will get the Android 7.0 update. Keep in mind that the following families might not get the latest Google OS: Galaxy On, Galaxy C series, Galaxy J and Galaxy A. So far, the rumors about the Nougat update have not been confirmed, so we advise all Android fans to take them with a grain of salt.

While Google has confirmed that the gesture would not make its way to Nexus devices, a developer has made an application that will bring the feature to any phone running Android 6.0 or above with a fingerprint sensor. The developer shared his application on XDA and his story about how he wanted to make his device sleep by simply tapping on his fingerprint sensor. The issue is that the Pixel and Honor phones require hardware support so the developer found a way to use the accessibility settings to detect tapping and swiping motions on the sensor to enable certain actions, such as the notification panel. Currently, you can set up quick actions for a single tap and a fast swipe on the fingerprint sensor. Some of the functionality is still quite buggy, though, and might not respond every time to you tap or swipe on the sensor. Additionally, you will need root on your phone if you want the ability to turn off your display using a quick action. Watch the video below for a quick demonstration of the application. You can download the APK file here and sideload the app on your device to give it a try. As the Fingerprint Quick Action application is not on the Google Play Store, you will need to occasionally revisit the XDA forum to download updates. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

SAN FRANCISCO — YouTube has emerged as a break-out star in Google's cast of services as the online video site upstages cable television for a younger generation of viewers looking for amusement, news and music on their smartphones. The trend is contributing to an advertising shift away from traditional network television programming to the more eclectic and diversified mix of clips ranging from cute cat videos to sobering shots of street violence found on YouTube. As more advertising dollars flow to YouTube, it's making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report released Thursday, Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 percent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 percent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. All that money is providing Google with more financial firepower to buy the rights to stream cable networks' shows on YouTube, too, something likely to reel in even more viewers. It also is helping to finance Alphabet's investments in far-flung projects ranging from self-driving cars to Internet-beaming balloons. That segment, known as “Other Bets,” lost $865 million during the July-September period, narrowing from a $980 million setback last year as Alphabet imposed more expense controls. Smart deal YouTube has proven to be one of the best bets that Google has ever made since it bought the video site for $1.76 billion a decade ago. At that juncture, YouTube consisted mostly of crudely made videos shot by amateurs and clips pirated from movie and TV studios that were threatening to sue the site into oblivion. It had built a worldwide audience of about 72 million viewers when Google took control in November 2006. Since then, YouTube has evolved into a far more polished channel that has spawned unlikely stars such as “PewDiePie” (Swedish comedian Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg) while largely making peace with studios by creating an automated screening system that detects pirated content. YouTube says it has paid more than $2 billion to studios that have chosen to leave their material on the site and share in the ad revenue generated by their clips. Meanwhile, YouTube's audience has surpassed 1 billion, with 80 percent of the viewers outside the United States. YouTube boasts that its site reaches more people between the ages of 18 and 34 years old — the “millennial” generation — than any cable network. That segment of YouTube's audience is a major reason why more than half its video clips are watched on mobile devices. Google CEO Sundar Pichai likened YouTube to prime-time TV “for the mobile world” in a Thursday conference call that was streamed on YouTube. He told analysts that YouTube “continues to shine” as more major advertisers promote their brands on the site. Alphabet doesn't disclose how much money YouTube is making, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates YouTube's annual revenue has now reached $10 billion and is increasing by as much as 40 percent a year. The growth makes YouTube “one of the strongest assets fundamentally on the internet today,” Mahaney wrote in a research note earlier this week. Still lacking Despite its progress, YouTube has been slow in realizing its full potential, leaving it vulnerable to new challengers for viewer's attention, such as Facebook's Live video feature, says Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson. The problem, as Olson sees it, is that YouTube has had trouble persuading TV and movie studios to license more of their content on their site, something that that might have made YouTube as dominant in video as Google is in search. But YouTube could be on a major breakthrough, according to a report published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal. Citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Google had reached an agreement with CBS to include its network in a cable-like service called “Unplugged” that will debut on YouTube next year. Google is also negotiating for the rights to the Fox network, ESPN and NBC, among others, the Journal said. More Business Highmark CEO made $3.8M last year Student debt weighing you down?

Cantech Letter The Very Best of Canadian Science and Technology Home About Us Archive Currently Trending Cantech Investment Conference ||| ||| Wireless Interviews Software Lists and Data Cleantech Life Sciences Hardware Gaming Opinion Science Fintech Google to award $5 million to Canada’s most innovative non-profits October 29, 2016 By Dylan Waddell 2 Comments Share this: Twitter0 Google+2 Facebook0 Google is looking for Canada’s most innovative not-for-profits. The search engine giant yesterday announced it will divvy up $5-million and disperse it between the ten most innovative Canadian non-profit organizations through means of a competition called the Google.org Impact Challenge. Ten finalists will be chosen to pitch an idea on March 6th to a panel of judges in Toronto. “We want to make a better world, faster. That’s what this Challenge is designed to do,” said Sam Sebastian, Managing Director, Google Canada. “We have huge expectations for what Canada can deliver through the Google.org Impact Challenge. Not only is Canada home to some of the world’s smartest and most talented tech innovators, but we also have a deep commitment to humanitarian causes both as a nation and as individuals.” Google.org, which is Google’s philanthropic arm, has already dispersed grants in France, Japan, India, Australia, the U.K., Germany, and the United States, all of which have gone to the most innovating groups who have shown an interest in making the world a better place through the means of technology. Google.org donates $100 million dollars a year in grants to groups across the world, as well as a billion dollars in products. “We have huge expectations of what Canada can deliver through this impact challenge,” says Sebastian. “We’re as ambitious as we’ve ever been in this country, but you pair that with an openness and a humanitarianism that I just don’t think you can find anywhere else around the world, and… amazing things can happen.” Non-profit groups that wish to participate must submit their ideas by no later than November 26th, 2016. Ideas will then be narrowed down and the public will then be eligible to vote for which projects they believe are the best and could be the most impactful in February. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Grab a free towel?

On the basis of my extended experience with Google’s Pixel, I consider it an all-around better phone than the iPhone 7. The final exhilarating straw that broke the camel’s back was the photo below, coming straight out of the Pixel XL’s camera, undoctored other than for a horizon adjustment. Omfg, this Pixel XL photo. pic.twitter.com/swB1Otm0jM — Vlad Savov (@vladsavov) October 27, 2016 I take a lot of photos with phones, it’s a major part of my job of reviewing them, but this one (full resolution here) is easily the best one I’ve ever shot. The circumstances are worth recounting: I was in the middle of crossing New York City’s 7th Avenue on a rainy and windy night, and only stopped because I knew I could take a quick shot with the Pixel that might be worth preserving afterwards. This is because of Google’s ingenious shortcut of double-tapping the power button to launch the camera — which works in a wet environment whereas the iPhone’s Touch ID might not. And it’s also because I’d already seen what the Pixel’s camera can do, bringing DSLR-like sharpness and color to some challenging situations. It was the Pixel’s camera that nudged me into using it as my daily phone over the iPhone 7, but I still believed that the sober advice was to buy an iPhone for the better app and accessory ecosystem, resale value, and industrial design. Those things haven’t changed, but my judgment of how far ahead the Pixel is of any other cameraphone has changed. I couldn’t have taken that shot with any other phone, of that I’m almost certain. Without re-reviewing the Pixel, I’ll simply say that its performance is super fast, the battery of the XL model lasts for a long time, and Google’s Android notification system is much more to my liking than Apple’s in iOS. And since I’m already eyebrow-deep in Google’s web services, it’s a no-brainer. Now excuse me while I go make a Live Case out of this crazy photograph. P.S. — All the photos in this report about new car brand Lynk & Co were also shot with the Pixel XL.

Zatz Not Funny! Categories TiVo Roku Cord Cutting Smart Home Apple Reviews Contact About Android TV is Fantastic. Well Mostly Joel Ward —  October 29, 2016 — 30 Comments Fellow tech enthusiast and DC neighbor Joel Ward jumps back into his role as a Features contributor here at Zatz Not Funny. Beyond ZNF, Joel can be found at Joelsef Explains It All and @joelsef on Twitter. I recently picked up a new Sony TV with Android TV for our living room. This television replaced a Sony LCD HDTV from the late 2000s. That set hails from an era when the majority of TVs were dumb — no built-in apps that today’s smart TVs feature. But I increased its intelligence by first adding a Windows Media Center PC back in 2009, then experimenting with Google TV, Boxee, Chromecast, and ultimately settling on Roku 3 as our over-the-top streamer. We arrive in 2016 and it’s nearly impossible to find a decent television over 30″ without some sort of “smart” designation and apps aplenty. That’s why I decided to go with a Sony this time around. The last time we refreshed a TV (for a different room, back in 2013) we went with a Samsung and its Samsung Smart Hub. In the three years we’ve had that TV, Samsung has pared down the 2013 TV’s UI to the very basics and removed many of the original features. It still has apps, including Netflix and HBO, but it’s nothing like what Roku offers. Our new Sony X800D series runs Android TV and Sony has Android TV across most of its television line now. Besides the Nvidia Shield and now defunct Google Nexus Player, Sony is the biggest player in Android TV at the moment, although Sharp and Philips have options as well. The interface is very clean and modern. You can get Android TV compatible apps from the Google Play store. Since we picked up the set in July, many more apps have come online and for the most part are on par with what we use on Roku but the number of apps still doesn’t equal Roku’s catalog. For those apps without an Android TV version, you can use GoogleCast to beam content from your phone or PC, from apps with that feature of course. No separate ChromeCast necessary. Miracast/WiFi direct screen mirroring is built in as well. The power of Google is the search, and this TV has Google powered text and voice search via a microphone in the remote. You can easily search the app store this way, and also search some app content from the home menu. More app developers need to integrate with this service. Another cool feature is the integration of the Channels app with other tuners like HDHomeRun and DirectTV. The HDHomeRun integration may work with the (still) upcoming HDHomeRun DVR too. The Channels app, and HDHomeRun’s native Android TV app, are a little clunky though. The Live Channels app, another Google creation, is an attempt at combining live broadcast channels alongside streaming services “channels” for an integrated guide. It is a work in progress but the interface shows promise. On the other end of the spectrum, there is a Kodi app with many content options within the familiar if not dated interface. For HDHomeRun DVR integration that may work best. The main complaint I’ve had has been the quirkiness of the TV. For the first few months some features didn’t work right, like GoogleCast. The TV rebooted itself a lot too. Recent updates have stabilized it, but this does make me nervous. When your smart TV might reboot itself on a whim, maybe a dumb TV is a better idea. That said, I have confidence this will not be an ongoing issue. This new TV with Android TV built in has all but replaced the need to use an external streaming box like Roku in our living room. If the platform keeps expanding with new apps and integrations, I think Google finally has a chance to take over the living room. Pros Familiar Android interface Google powered search Many apps ported to the Android TV interface GoogleCast built in Miracast/WiFi Direct screen mirroring Integration with 3rd party tuners like HDHomeRun and DirectTV Cons The TV software has been quirky, though recent updates have stabilized it Not as many apps available as Roku, but Makes up for it with Google Cast support Android TV’s Channels app is still a little clunky Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) In Android, CableCARD, Chromecast Android TV, sony   Related Stories 30 responses to Android TV is Fantastic. Well Mostly cybergrimes October 29, 2016 at 4:02 pm As an owner of a Sony GoogleTV set you will never talk me out of cheap external streaming boxes. Our TV has literally lost all usefulness beyond Netflix. If I bought a TV today I would get a Vizio with Chromecast built in since its probably the closest to a avoiding a smart TV interface. Bud October 29, 2016 at 5:45 pm “Almost as good as a Roku”? Get a Roku… and a dumb TV. Why buy a TV with smarts built in, only to have the “smarts” set outsmarted by newer devices? Tim October 29, 2016 at 7:16 pm For those who read this article and aren’t aware, Android TV isn’t just an app platform for smart TVs like the Sony set that the reviewer owns. It’s also available on standalone boxes, including the Mi Box from Xiaomi ($69) and the high-end Nvidia Shield TV ($199 and up). I’m trying out a Mi Box right now. My initial thoughts is that Android TV has a lot of promise but is still a bit rough. It sports a more attractive, useful and customizable home screen UI than Roku or Amazon Fire TV but it has fewer apps than either of those platforms. That said, all of the major video streaming apps are available for Android TV now with the exception of Amazon Video, which is only available in the US on Sony TVs running Android TV, where it’s pre-installed. (It can also be installed — “sideloaded” — and will run on the Nvidia Shield TV, although it’s a bit of a workaround since the app isn’t available on the Google Play app store for easy downloading.) One of the biggest gripes I have about Android TV is that media playback controls aren’t consistent between the various major apps available, so you have to get used to slightly different sequences of button presses on the remote to achieve the same results in one streaming app versus another. Hopefully Google does a better job going forward of encouraging app developers to conform to a single standard set of controls. This may not be an issue if you’re using Android TV on a Sony TV because the remote control has dedicated buttons for play/pause, rewind, fast forward, etc. The remotes for the Mi Box and Nvidia Shield TV, however, do not have such buttons; all playback commands must be done through a four-way directional pad with center select button. One of the areas where Android TV offers the most promise, though, is the potential to marry live TV and DVR functionality in the same device as a slew of streaming apps plus games. Various companies, including Silicon Dust, Plex and Google themselves are working on this through various apps, including Google’s own Live Channels app, and various tuners, including network tuners from Silicon Dust and USB OTA tuners that can be plugged directly into your Android TV box. There are no fully-done polished solutions here quite yet but things are progressing. Joel Ward October 29, 2016 at 10:04 pm @cybergrimes: I feel your pain. I never had Google TV built in to a TV, but tested out the Logitech Revue box back in 2012. It was terrible and they didn’t give it much love and it died a horrible death. I do still have that Revue I need to pull out and test. Anyway, you can hardly find a TV these days without some streaming technology built in. Especially at the higher end, the manufacturers pile that stuff on. That’s what Sony is doing. For many people, those built in apps, even if limited, is all they will ever want to deal with. So if it’s Netflix and that’s it, that’s what they use. Android TV is a big step up from that, and for many, including us, the integration with the set is very usable and useful right now. I do agree that an external box is the safest way to go long term. Even if a platform is supported, like the Samsung Smart Hub, older sets may not get major updates after a few years. Even if Android TV does stick around, Sony could forget about older sets at some point. Thing is, even if they do, we can always get an external box at that point. If they don’t, we can keep the simplified setup and be perfectly happy. However, I do think Android TV built-in to Sony TVs may have more staying power. 1) Android TV is a good platform and it’s expanding, and no sign Google has given up on it–yet. 2) Sony has gone in whole hog across all of their sets, not just a few. 3) It is related to Android apps and GoogleCast, which are not going away anytime soon. Joel Ward October 29, 2016 at 10:12 pm @Bud: This new Sony Android TV replaced an older dumb TV that had a Roku. Finding a TV over 40″ without some smart TV interface is near impossible, especially in the 4K variety. See my comment to @cybergrimes above. I agree that the long term view of integrated smart TV operating systems is unsure, and likely unreliable. However, for many people the built-in features are enough. From what I’ve seen across the major TV manufacturers these days, I’m most impressed with the integrated Android TV in this Sony compared to any other options. Even if Roku is built in. I’m really just bored of the Roku UI and it sorely needs an update. It does work well and the number of apps is plentiful, but unless they upgrade that platform a lot I think another player like Android TV or even Apple TV could take over. Yeah, I said it. Joel Ward October 29, 2016 at 10:20 pm @Tim: Very well stated. This article was meant to focus on the Android TV platform itself, not so much on the Sony integration. However, both topics are pertinent and I’m glad we’re talking about them. It is still a work in progress. However, the user interface (UI) of Android TV blows Roku out of the water. User experience (UX): Roku may win there for consistency across apps. However, the current Roku interface looks older while Android TV looks newer and fresher. Roku needs to catch up. If Sony does do what they should do and support it long term, it may be a winner in integrated sets. If we see more streaming boxes like the Nvidia Shield and Mi Box it might have a better chance overall. Does anyone know about Sharp and Philips integration? Is the new Nintendo that runs on the Nvidia hardware going to run Android TV too? Lastly, yes, the integration with tuners and streaming apps is where I want to see the improvements. Not only in a unified interface across all content sources so no external boxes are necessary, but also in SEARCH. Which is where Google could really shine if app developers hook into the search properly. I am hopeful. I am watching the HDHomeRun DVR app progress (slowly) but am hopeful. Bryan Hughes October 29, 2016 at 10:22 pm Granted, it’s not the focus of the article, but how is the audio? Joel Ward October 29, 2016 at 10:27 pm @Bryan Hughes: The built in speakers are okay. It’s a very thin set, so it doesn’t have the larger speakers to produce fuller sound like the old Sony LCD that we replaced. That was thicker and had better mid-range and bass. The new Sony sound is just okay. However, we don’t really use the built-in speakers. Our older Sony DVD surround system works well with HDMI ARC control and optical out from the TV, and that provides the real sound we need. And yes, the Sony TV outputs full surround even from the cable box pass through, unlike our Samsung! mike October 29, 2016 at 11:59 pm Get SPMC instead of Kodi for Android TV. It’s a fork by the guy who did a lot of the Android integration on Kodi. It is basically Kodi with a more up to date feature set for Android TV. Other than a lack of Amazon – which Sony TVs do have – it is pretty complete for major streaming services. Even Playstation Vue just launched for the platform. Worst part is the nearly complete lack of attention from other Google properties/services. No Photos app integration. Though that will be addressed a good deal by Google Home I think. Other things too though, like how bare bones the Play Music app is. Still no podcast integration. All that said you can load Chrome via the web Play Store. At least on Nvidia Shield. You need a third party launcher to run it. But then you can use the joysticks on the Shield game pad for cursor control. You can also easily add a keyboard/mouse etc… MJR October 30, 2016 at 4:30 am Android means Google and Google loses interest in things. They may be build this stuff into TV’s, but you can still tun the TV’s as dumb. Not a fan of software built into TV’s, just like phones the manufacturer may choose not to update the software built in. Sony makes nice TV’s though, Donkey Kong October 30, 2016 at 8:17 am PlayStation Vue just launched for Android TV this week and cable companies should be very worried. It’s AWESOME. I am not missing anything from the crappy FiOS TV I canceled. Except Dolby 5.1, but at over $100 less per month I will take the trade off. $260 per month for garbage programming, garbage guide, garbage UI/DVR, and garbage equipment. I am loving my Sony bravia with Android TV! Peter Rév October 30, 2016 at 9:15 am A lot of Google apps like Photos or Chrome you will not find via Android TV Google Play. You have to enter the Play store via your PC and install from your PC into your Android TV. This will solve the problem only halfway, because apps installed from your PC into your Android TV will not appear on your Android TV Home screen. You will find them under Settings – Apps only. Stupid right?! Joel Ward October 30, 2016 at 11:14 am @Peter: There are definitely some things missing. However for many people’s needs, and our needs, it does the same or more than most smart TVs. But yes, quirky as usual, which is typical for Google. Joel Ward October 30, 2016 at 11:16 am @MJR: I tend to agree. However, as smart TVs are hard to avoid especially with larger screens, it’s nice to have a workable option with the built in OS. Maybe it will last, maybe it won’t. For now it works well and if they ever give up on it, the TV has plenty of HDMI inputs. Joel Ward October 30, 2016 at 11:18 am I wrote this to be more about Android TV than focusing on the Sony integration. However the integration aspect is interesting too. As for Android TV, I don’t have experience with the other devices like the Nvidia Shield. How does that compare? Has anyone seen the Sharp or Philips options? Any other sub-$100 Android TV boxes like the Mi? Philip Merritt October 30, 2016 at 2:49 pm KODI gets a really bad rep for the payee addon but as far as your one stop shop for all things media…..it is fantastic. There is a bit of a learning curve in seeing it up but once you get it down it has no equal imho. Even my wife loves using it and that’s saying A LOT. Also, for those apps that are sideload, lookup sideload launcher. It’s the missing link for that functionality. Android TV does EVERYTHING I need it to do. With a powerful device like shield tv you can even use it as a plex media server. The shield tv is powerful enough to replace a power hungry HTPC in a heartbeat. I see no reason for cable subscriptions anymore, you just need Internet and a good androidtv set top box. James DiCarlo October 30, 2016 at 3:17 pm I currently have a 2015 Sony TV with Android TV built in and have been very disappointed since Sony is dragging their butts in doing the update to marshmallow(forget about Nougat) and without marshmallow, mpeg2 channels from hdhomerun will not play correctly. Sony is suppose to fix this but I would not hold my breath. My Nexus player works without flaws in comparison to the Sony. Knowing this, i would have purchased a Vizio and a nexus player and recommend others to do the same. Jim trentbg October 30, 2016 at 3:57 pm @Joel Ward You might want to look at the newly introduced to the US market Le Eco TV sets, all of them are featuring higher level hardware and Android TV integration across all models. I am definitely grabbing the 55″ version that would be sold for $699 the first couple of weeks and test it out. Hopefully more and more companies will go to the route of integrating Android TV and better specs to support it. Steven schwamm October 30, 2016 at 4:25 pm Best tv I’ve very brought in years Sony smart tv great intertainer on anything from you tube to radio tune in mike October 30, 2016 at 4:40 pm One of the best parts about Nvidia Shield Android TV box has been Nvidia itself. Pretty timely updates and responsive to a lot of user input after the initial launch. We have had Marshmallow for a while and the grape-vine says we’ll have Nougat early next year. It’s not a perfect product but you definitely get the sense that somebody from Nvidia is still actively thinking about the product after you already paid them your money. Of course, no official Amazon app for Shield. A bummer for a lot of users. Still, if Nvidia came out with a sequel that had a couple updates – like hdmi pass-through and an upgradeable internal SSD – I’d buy in a heartbeat. I might not even wait for fantastic holiday pricing like I did last year for the unit I have now. ;-) Eric F November 2, 2016 at 1:46 am I really love my Nvidia Shield TV. Best TV box I’ve ever bought, bar-none. Plex server, Kodi, Netflix, works with my Harmony remote. Everything except for a real Amazon app. And I don’t even have a 4k TV yet. mike November 2, 2016 at 8:56 am Love my Nvidia Shield as well. Very flexible. But then a new streaming service launches like Filmstruck did recently and has no mention of the platform on their roadmap at all. I can’t help but be slightly peeved thinking that if Google had put their shoulder into it as much as Nvidia has the platform would be much, much further along by now. I see the platform being adopted by some TV makers and stuff and all that’s great. But I do wonder how long it will be until it is seen as a front tier product by content providers. I find it particularly chaffing that Fire TV gets more play. I understand why. But still, a fork of Android and it gets more play than Google’s official big screen version of Android. It really bothers me that Google services themselves don’t support it or support it so poorly. I don’t know how they expect their Android TV team to make the case to third parties when their own properties don’t even take the time to support it. All in all it’s a great platform. I just wish more content providers prioritized support for it – including Google. MJR November 2, 2016 at 11:19 pm Filmstruck can be considered a niche service and as such will roll out to platforms slowly. We don’t even know if there is a real market for this service at this point. mike November 3, 2016 at 12:03 am Whatever you consider it Android TV isn’t even on their roadmap which is not particularly slow or light at all. They are launching on Desktop, Android, iOS, and Fire TV now. They will have Apple TV by the end of the month. Roku and Chromecast within the next month or two. That’s pretty much every major platform. Not even mentioned – Android TV. Joel Ward November 3, 2016 at 12:26 am @Mike: If there is Chromecast/GoogleCast capability in the mobile apps, then it will work with Android TV since GoogleCast is built in. That’s one of the nice things about Android TV: if there isn’t a native app, there’s a good chance there’s GoogleCast support via mobile. Then eventually a native app might pop up. mike November 3, 2016 at 7:18 am Yes I’m aware it will work with Chromecast on Android TV devices. And it’s nice to have that backup capability. It will also be great to use with Google Home when it launches in a few days. However I went to a dedicated streaming box after having had a Chromecast because I prefer a physical remote. So it would be nice to have that native streaming support. The worst part is that according to Google supporting Android TV shouldn’t even be that difficult seeing as they are already supporting Android, not to mention Fire TV. But even for that claimed slight extra bit of work it’s not even on their roadmap. That goes back to my complaint about Google’s general support of the platform. They make the case it is very easy to support if you already support Android. However so many of their own properties don’t even bother. Google has a lot of content I’d like on my tv. All those museums available on their cultural institute website. All those maps walk throughs of national parks and destinations all over the world. My pics and vids in Google Photos. And then there is the weak support of Play Music. And also Youtube got a recent UI upgrade on every major streaming platform – except Android TV. I can get around a lot of that with Chromecast. But I shouldn’t have to. AP November 3, 2016 at 11:09 pm With the Nvidia Shield being out of stock most places, do we have any ETA on when the next version will be out? I believe the FCC showed it a month or two back. Brian November 10, 2016 at 11:40 am I am trying to understand the assertion in this article that the Live Channels app can be integrated with “3rd party tuners” including DirecTV. I would love if this were true but there isn’t even an official DirecTV app that is available for this device from the Play Store let alone one that integrates with the Live Channels app. Can you clarify what you meant and how you were able to get DirecTV to work on this? Joel Ward November 11, 2016 at 5:07 pm @Brian: The Live Channels app–the Android TV one–can integrate with a handful of apps. DirecTV is not one of them. It appears that the DirecTV integration may be Sony-specific. It appears as an option on the Inputs selection in the UI. Sony has their own version of “Channels” that has its own guide and limited integration with tuners like HDHomeRun. Not sure why they made their own, but they did. I believe if you use Sony’s DirecTV integration then it integrates with their “Channels” guide. We don’t have DirecTV so I can’t test right now. Joel Ward November 11, 2016 at 5:08 pm @AP: I have not seen anything about the next Nvidia Shield. Anyone else have an idea?

Register for an Exam Today> Sale or No Sale, Changes Could Come to Twitter Users By Barbara Ortutay PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 29 2016 Sale or no sale, Twitter users are bound to see changes as the beleaguered communications service tries to broaden its appeal to more people and advertisers. A new owner could clean up Twitter and curb some of the nastiness that's become synonymous with it. Or perhaps a new owner would just show more ads. Or let it languish while it mines the best of what Twitter now has into its existing products and services. All of this is speculation, of course, and there might not even be a new owner. Twitter's stock has plunged after rumored bidders are, well, rumored to be no longer interested. On Thursday, the company announced that it would cut 9 percent of its workforce globally as its revenue growth slowed. While adjusted earnings beat Wall Street expectations, it reported a loss of almost $103 million before one-time charges and costs are removed. A new parent -- whether that's Google (huh?), Salesforce (who?) or Disney (hmm...) -- could inject fresh life into a 10-year-old company that's never turned a profit and remains confounding to many people. Of course, none of these potential suitors have acknowledged interest in Twitter, let alone their plans for it. Even if Twitter stays independent, drastic changes to its service might just be what Twitter needs to be competitive with Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. How might it change? Twitter Becomes More Like Its New Owner, if There Is One Facebook's absorption of Instagram and WhatsApp in recent years could offer clues. Both services have kept separate identities, to an extent, and have experienced user growth. But slowly, they are acquiring Facebook-like features. For example, Instagram no longer presents feeds chronologically; they are now sorted much like Facebook's news feed, using some secret formula known only to Facebook. Though the change has turned off some early Instagram users, its user base has soared, to 500 million as of June. That's nearly 200 million more than Twitter, even though Instagram is three years younger. As Instagram gets more users and a mainstream appeal, its content has diluted somewhat. But many of the street photographers, graffiti artists and tween mini-celebrities who made Instagram what it is are still there -- maybe just harder to find. Stays the Same But With More Ads Twitter has never turned a profit, and whoever buys it will need to fix this. That means boosting the user base, so advertisers would follow. That also could mean better targeting, so that ad rates go up. Google, anyone? The search giant is the leader in online ads. Imagine what its might and muscle could do to Twitter's ad business. YouTube hardly had any ads when Google bought it; now, ads are so prevalent that YouTube is able to charge $10 a month for an ad-free version called Red. Instagram has also inserted ads into users' feeds of perfectly composed snapshots featuring everything from cappuccino foam to seafoam. It started out slowly with a carefully curated ad here and there, but today you're not likely to avoid ads when opening the app. A Tool for Brands, Not Revolution Jonathan Cowperthwait, a Twitter user since 2008, said he'd be worried if Google bought Twitter because the online search giant "is the worst" at social services that aim to foster online interactions, beyond email. Its Google Plus service never took off; Orkut and Dodgeball closed. Cowperthwait said that rather than let Twitter live independently, Google might "try to shoehorn it back into their own social product." Salesforce, a company that provides internet services to businesses, has also been mentioned as a contender, leading to a lot of head-scratching among users. Would Twitter become a business product, used for customer service and marketing instead of revolutions, neo-Nazi memes and political outbursts? "Salesforce is a very technology-driven company," eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. "It seems they would want (Twitter) mostly for the data that Twitter has." The Little Bird Falls Out of the Nest Remember MySpace? It was the social network before Facebook came along. News Corp., the stodgy media conglomerate, bought it for $580 million in 2005. But users started falling off as MySpace failed to keep up with Facebook's speedy innovations. After layoffs and failed relaunches, News Corp. sold the fallen giant for $35 million in 2011, and that was just about the end of it. It's not unthinkable that Twitter could suffer the same fate under a big media company. Silence! Walt Disney's reputation as a squeaky-clean, family-friendly company is perhaps the clearest antithesis to Twitter's soul, as many users see it -- even though Disney is much bigger than Mickey Mouse and owns ABC, Marvel and the "Star Wars" franchise, among other properties. "My chief fear is that Disney will wield Twitter as one large PR machine to prop up their image and squash dissent," said Timothy Hayes, an Ohio State University student who says he fell in love with Twitter in high school. "The Mouse is not above silencing (its) opponents." Some users, on the other hand, might welcome some thorough housecleaning that goes beyond the steps Twitter is currently taking to curb abuse and nasty behavior on its service. One Twitter user, New York attorney Danny Mann, says that while Google has improved YouTube "in ways that were unimaginable at the time," he finds many of his fellow YouTube users difficult to deal with. In this sense, it's possible that even with Google's weight behind it, the abusive and nasty nature of many Twitter comments would remain as is. © 2016 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge.

You Can Save Up to $400 When Purchasing the Pixel/Pixel XL from Verizon GO Current customers can save up to $300 instead Oct 29, 2016 16:14 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Android fans in the United States don't have too many options if they want to purchase the Google Pixel or Pixel XL smartphones. The devices are exclusive to Verizon, at least for the time being, so unless you order one directly from Google, there aren't any other options available to you. T-Mobile announced a few days ago that those who purchased an unlocked Pixel smartphone are eligible to receive up to $325 in credit, which is half the price of the 32GB model. The condition is to sign up for T-Mobile ONE and show the Magenta carrier the proof of purchase. But if you can't afford to buy an unlocked Pixel/Pixel XL smartphone and you have to choose Verizon, then you'll be pleased to know the Big Red has an interesting offer for those who want a Google phone. All new Verizon customers can trade-in their smartphones and save up to $400 on the purchase of the Pixel/Pixel XL. On the other hand, if you're already a Verizon customer, you will only be given the option to save up to $300 towards the purchase of the Pixel/Pixel XL. Play Video Aside from the fact that the phone you trade in must be in working condition, Verizon will only offer you the maximum amount ($300) for these smartphones: Apple iPhone 6, HTC M9, LG V10, Samsung Galaxy Note 5, Samsung Galaxy S6, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge, and Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+. It's also worth noting that Verizon now offers the 32GB Pixel model for $650 outright, so you can get it for just $250 if you're a new subscriber and meet all the requirements mentioned above. The improved version featuring 128GB of storage costs $750. However, if you're into larger phones, Verizon sells the 32GB Pixel XL for $770, whereas the 128GB version is available for purchase for $870. Each of the Pixel/Pixel XL variants can also be had on monthly payments, but this will require you to sign up for a long-term agreement. #Pixel XL#Verizon#Pixel smartphone#Google Pixel#32GB Pixel subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Offers $50 Gift Cards to Some Customers Who Pre-ordered the Pixel Phones Google Pixel May Have Bluetooth Pairing Issues with Vehicles Google Updates Allo with Split-Screen Support and Direct Reply Google's Pixel Phone Is 50% Off at T-Mobile OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2    Verizon trade-in offer New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Samsung Already Capable of Mass Producing Foldable Smartphones but It's Cautious more on: Samsung foldable phone i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

GET IN TOUCH       Ghana News Ghana News, Ghana Politics, Ghana Sports, Ghana Business           Home Business Politics Elections Sport Showbiz Odd But True Opinion Relationship Lifestyle Infographics Photo Gallery TV Google tries new approach with voice on Pixel phone Saturday 29th October , 2016 3:53 pm The Google Pixel phone is displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company’s Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc’s Google, which crashed Apple Inc’s smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world’s smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach – more akin to Apple’s tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel’s hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year’s phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google’s Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company’s voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Corp’s Cortana. “We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information,” Rakowski said in an interview. LEAF FROM APPLE’S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn’t enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a “whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button.” The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words “OK Google.” By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google “doesn’t have to do negotiations with another handset maker – they can make it as tight as they want,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers’ Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. “We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do,” he said “We don’t want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way.” He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. “You can’t do some of the always-on ‘OK Google’ detection on some phones because they don’t include the right hardware to do that,” he said. “In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position.” SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world’s top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. “If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. “They will be relegated to just pushing hardware.” Google is coy about its plans. “Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible,” Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant – such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. “The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience,” he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others’ hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. “As we went from desktops to mobile, it’s not like one replaced the other… It expanded the pie,” he said. “I approach this the same way.” – Source: Reuters Google Pixel phone Godwin Akweiteh Allotey Tagged with: Google Pixel phone More on citifmonline.com Flippy Campus launches online marketplace for tertiary students November 14, 2016 Facebook to do more tackling fake news November 14, 2016 Facebook wants to make you secure November 13, 2016 Facebook bug ‘kills’ users in ‘terrible error’ November 12, 2016 Spotify patches ‘data gobbling’ glitch November 11, 2016 13 year old honoured internationally for feats in tech space November 11, 2016 General News Mahama opens Kwame Nkrumah Interchange project [Photos] November 14, 2016 Burkinabe arrested for gruesome murder of school principal November 14, 2016 UK threatens to deny visas over election violence in Ghana November 14, 2016 We may deny visas over election violence – US warns Ghana November 14, 2016 Nana Addo doesn’t understand realities of governance – Mahama November 14, 2016 Advertisement Recent Posts Mahama opens Kwame Nkrumah Interchange project [Photos] Eyewitness News, Monday, November 14th, 2016 10th Further and Higher Education Conference opens in Accra [Photos] Bolgatanga SHS wins 2016 NHIS Quiz competition There’s no error with NPP logo on ballot – EC Burkinabe arrested for gruesome murder of school principal UK threatens to deny visas over election violence in Ghana We may deny visas over election violence – US warns Ghana Flippy Campus launches online marketplace for tertiary students Road Safety Management Services deploys tow trucks at Circle interchange Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2016 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Polar M600 review: For Android users who want to be more connected during workouts Is a true Android Wear sports watch worth $330? by Valentina Palladino - Oct 29, 2016 2:52 pm UTC Login to bookmark 41 Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. There's no shortage of Android Wear watches to choose from. Companies including Huawei, LG, Casio, and Fossil all have smartwatches that run on Google's wearable operating system, and all of them can use Google Fit's activity tracking. Now, the fitness company Polar is getting into the mix with the M600 Android Wear-based fitness watch, which is the first device that integrates Polar's existing exercise software with Android Wear. The M600 wants to appeal to a specific kind of user: one who is into fitness and wants a heart rate monitor and onboard GPS in their tracker, but who also cares about getting wrist notifications and using wearable apps. But at $329, Polar's device is right up there with the Apple Watch in price, and that might be too steep for some consumers, considering the experience it offers is much different. Design: Too bulky for its own good Like most hardcore fitness watches, the M600 is chunky. And since it is running Android Wear, that design almost works against it. The watch module, which can be removed to fit into different bands, is rectangular and holds the square 1.3-inch, 260 PPI touchscreen and two physical buttons: one on the left side of the device that opens the Android Wear app menu and one underneath the display that opens the Polar Flow app. The display is bold and bright, and while it can fall victim to glare in direct sunlight, it's easy to read most of the time and easy to navigate. Inside the M600 is an optical heart rate monitor and a GPS chip. That makes the device fairly thick at .5 inches, and while it's not particularly heavy, it looks monstrous on my small wrist. The band is made of a durable silicone which is much thicker than the regular silicone used in others like the Apple Watch's sport bands. It does have a double-prong watch-like closure, though, making it easy to tighten just enough so that the heart rate monitor can do its job, but also not cut off circulation. The M600's design is perfectly fine for working out, which is no surprise since it's basically just a wider, bigger vision of the $199 Polar A360. It's comfortable and also has an IPX8 waterproof rating, so you can swim in water up to 10 meters deep with it as well. But as a device you may want to wear all day long to take advantage of Android Wear and all its features, the M600 is simply way too big. Only if you don't mind bulky wristbands will you be able to wear the M600 without it feeling ostentatious. The M600 comes with a proprietary charging port that sticks magnetically to nodes on the back of the band. Connecting can be hard if you don't position the charger correctly and allow the nodes to attach in every location. Since this is an Android Wear-based device, I used our battery test to see how long it would last. On average, the M600's 500mAh battery lasted 784 minutes (roughly 13 hours) on a single charge. Our battery test continuously sends messages to the watch to ensure its display never fully turns off, so that estimate is based on never-ending activity. Polar estimates the M600 can get up to two days during normal activity (when connected to an Android phone and regularly receiving notifications) and 8 hours while training. So our test results fall in line with this. Valentina Palladino Polar's $330 M600. Valentina Palladino Polar's $330 M600. Valentina Palladino Removable silicone band.

Valentina Palladino Polar Flow looks much like how it does on Polar's other devices. Valentina Palladino Sport profiles always track heart rate, and some that are outdoor activities automatically the turn GPS on. Valentina Palladino "My Day" shows you how much you've moved during the day so far. Features: Fitness made more practical with Android Wear At first, you may not even realize the M600 runs Android Wear. The default watch face shows the time and date in large blue and white text, and it looks like Polar's other devices. As you move throughout the day, a bar slides up the display to show you how far you've gone to reach your activity goal. Of course, thanks to Android Wear, you can change the watch face to whatever you'd like. But since this is a Polar device first-and-foremost, the default display works with the embedded Polar Flow app to make sure you don't forget who made it. On any other Polar device, the button directly below the display would open Polar Flow. But on the M600, it just feels like the default workout program (and it is). There, you can start a new workout session or tap "My Day" to get an overview of your activity progress thus far. You can program up to 20 sport profiles to appear on the watch under Training, so choosing the one you want to start is easy, and the watch will track you. As soon as you tap on Training, the watch starts to glean your heart rate and kick the GPS into gear. Depending on the activity, GPS may not always be activated (it's turned off automatically for indoor workouts) which is convenient since I don't want to have to remember to turn on or off the GPS myself. The sheer number of sport profiles that Polar can track will intrigue well-rounded athletes. But those sport profiles are available on most other Polar devices, so the M600 is just working with the software that wearables like the A360 already have. What makes the M600 so expensive (even for Polar) is not just that it runs Android Wear, but it also has the embedded heart rate monitor, GPS, and GLONASS technology. When compared to the $370 Apple Watch Series 2 during a treadmill running session, the M600's heart rate monitor was a little slow to catch up to the Apple Watch's reading. At its worst, the M600 was nearly 20 bpm lower than the Apple Watch. However, as my heart rate plateaued and started to remain steady at about 168 bpm, both watches remained within 5 bpm of each other. The M600 is also compatible via Bluetooth with Polar's H7 heart rate chest strap. So if you have an H7 already or prefer the precision of a chest strap, you have that option. The one thing you can't do with Polar's interface is take a manual heart rate reading. The monitor isn't on 24/7 and there's no option to read your pulse when you're not working out. You can get around this by going into Google Fit and using that app's heart rate detection screen. However, I prefer the interface on Samsung's $180 Gear Fit 2 that lets you take a manual reading and tag it with descriptors like "resting," "after workout," and "happy." The M600's GPS is automatically on for all non-indoor workouts, and it doesn't take long for it to grab your location. You can start an exercise session before the GPS kicks in fully as well, so there's no waiting involved. Every session recorded with GPS will have a Google Map included in Polar Flow underneath that session's stat breakdown. The GPS is quick, easy, and accurate, which are the most important traits for wearable GPS chips to have. Unlike Samsung's Gear Fit 2, Polar hasn't said it will allow you to view mapped routes on the watch itself. So you'll have to stick with Polar Flow on your smartphone to see all of your maps. Long-pressing the side button or swiping left on the display are your entryways to Android Wear. Both will bring up the app drawer where you can access a bunch of Google apps and any third-party apps you've downloaded. Other Polar devices like the A360 can receive smartphone notifications, so what you really get with Android Wear on the M600 is Google's own spin on those notifications, as well as access to full apps. Notifications are certainly richer on Android Wear compared to the native alerts on Polar's other devices. You can scroll to see full messages and reply from the watch as well. You can't do that on the A360. Even if you aren't excited by the third-party apps for Android Wear, at least you have the option to use them. I mostly stuck with Google's native apps like Maps, which let me view a map of my location and find destination spots from my wrist. This experience could get even better when Android Wear 2.0 is released and you can download apps directly to your wearable without needing a companion smartphone app. But that update won't be available until next year, and when the M600 will get it is uncertain. Google Now-powered voice control is another feature you can use on the M600 but not on any pure Polar device. I used this a lot at home when I didn't want to unlock my smartphone, and it translates my voice to text more accurately than not. You also don't need to go into the Google app on the M600 to start Google Now either: simply saying "Ok Google" with the watch on your wrist will make Google listen, as on any Android Wear device. The M600 can save music locally to its 4GB of internal storage, too. You can download tracks from Google Play Music or other sources and save them to the watch, pair some wireless earbuds to it, and go for a run without your phone. I had a pair of Jabra wireless buds on me for part of the time I spent with the M600, and the watch immediately sensed when the earbuds were within pairing range and asked to sync with them. These music features, combined with the onboard GPS, will be a huge convenience for outdoor runners and cyclists.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States What Analysts Are Saying About Alphabet After Earnings By Chris Lange October 29, 2016 9:25 am EST Print Email Tweet Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported third-quarter 2016 results after markets closed Thursday. Initially the data pushed the stock higher but it ended Friday relatively flat. However, a few key analysts had important takeaways from the report, and across the board price targets went up. 24/7 Wall St. has included some highlights from the earnings report, as well as what analysts are saying about Alphabet after the fact. The search engine behemoth reported adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $9.06 on revenues of $22.45 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Alphabet posted EPS of $7.35 on revenues of $18.68 billion. Analysts were estimating $8.63 EPS on $22.05 billion in revenue. The Google segment posted revenues of $22.25 billion, up from $18.53 billion a year ago. Operating income rose from $5.81 billion to $6.78 billion. The operating loss on other (Bets) revenues totaled $865 million, down from $980 million in the year ago quarter. Revenues at Google websites rose 23% to $16.1 billion, and Google Network revenues rose 1% to $3.73 billion. Ad revenues rose 18% to $19.82 billion. Because Alphabet does not break out the source of advertising revenues by desktop versus mobile, it’s a little hard to draw any conclusion other than an 18% increase is solid. Traffic acquisition costs paid to Google Network members rose to 70% of Network revenues, or $2.62 billion. Payments to distribution partners totaled $1.56 billion, about 10% of websites revenues. Total traffic acquisition costs rose to $4.18 billion and were flat year over year as a percentage total ad revenues (21%). Paid clicks on Google websites were up 42% year over year and up 11% sequentially. Paid clicks on the Network members sites were up 1% year over year and sequentially. Aggregate cost per click fell 11%, compared with the year-ago quarter, and was down 5% sequentially. Credit Suisse had an Outperform rating and raised its price target to $1,070 from $1,120. The brokerage firm went on to say: Google reported a top and bottom line beat with currency-neutral revenue growth of 23% – the contributing factors were once again improvements in mobile search and YouTube for the Web Sites segment, as well as Google Play and Cloud for the Other segment. FCF to double YOY owing to moderating capex. We continue to anticipate benefits from recent ad product rollouts (Expanded Text Ads, etc.) as ongoing catalysts. Merrill Lynch reiterated a Buy rating and raised its price target to $970. Overall, the firm believes that growth deceleration was more moderate than expected, but core expenses were high. Multiple growth drivers are helping to counter the tougher comps seen in Mobile, YouTube, Programmatic and Cloud. Merrill Lynch finished by saying that sentiment should improve as deceleration fades and new drivers ramps, and the $7 billion buyback also helps. Jefferies reiterated a Buy rating for Alphabet with a $1,000 price target and further commented: Alphabet easily beat estimates with strength again coming from mobile search and YouTube, the most important products. From a capital allocation standpoint, we appreciate Alphabet is investing in strategic, promising areas like Google Assistant and hardware, while pausing investment in less rewarding areas like Fiber. Alphabet remains a Franchise Pick and we reiterate our Buy rating. Other analysts weighed in on Alphabet as well: Canaccord Genuity has a Buy rating and raised its price target to $950 from $900. Cowen has an Outperform rating and raised its price target to $1,000 from $940. Deutsche Bank raised its target price to $1,080 from $1,050. Goldman Sachs raised its price target to $970 from $930.

How do you know whether or not Google is watching you as you do and keeps on eye on whether or not you like the results you receive during your searches? Could Satisfaction with search results be a ranking signal that Google may use now, or in the future? A newly published Google patent application describes technology that would modify scoring and ranking of query results using biometric indicators of user satisfaction or negative engagement with a search result. In other words; Google would track how satisfied or unsatisfied someone might be with search results, and using machine learning, build a model based upon that satisfaction, raising or lowering search results for a query. This kind of reaction might be captured using a camera on a searcher’s phone to see their reaction to a search result, as depicted in the following screenshot from the patent: This satisfaction would be based upon Google tracking and measuring biometric parameters of a user obtained after thst search result is presented to the user, to determine whether those may indicate negative engagement by the user with a search result. For example, someone searches for “Seafood Restaurants,” and the top result is a restaurant they have visited before and didn’t like, causing them to frown, which may be captured on their phone’s camera. That reaction may be seen as a negative signal by the search engine, and could potentially count against that restaurant ranking as highly for that query term. The patent tells us that such a reaction may influence search results for multiple searchers: The actions include providing a search result to a user; receiving one or more biometric parameters of the user and a satisfaction value; and training a ranking model using the biometric parameters and the satisfaction value. Determining that one or more biometric parameters indicate likely negative engagement by the user with the first search result comprises detecting: Increased body temperature Pupil dilation Eye twitching Facial flushing Decreased blink rate Increased heart rate. The patent is: Ranking Query Results Using Biometric Parameters Inventors: Jason Sanders, Gabriel Taubman Assignee: Google US Patent Application 20160103833 Published April 14, 2016 Filed: February 28, 2013 Abstract Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer program products, for providing query results using biometric parameters. One of the methods includes providing a search result in response to receiving a search query. If one or more of biometric parameters of a user indicate likely negative engagement by the user with the first search result, an additional search result is obtained and provided in response to the search query. Take Aways When I think of how often I get my face right up in my phone’s screen while searching for something, the idea that Google might use the phone’s camera to capture my facial impressions as I’m looking at results doesn’t surprise me. Would Google use such signals to rank search results, or build a model of biometric reactions to search results? It’s an interesting question. Instead of social media likes or dislikes, these rankings would be based upon what would be percieved as actual likes or dislikes. Could you envision Google using an approach like this one in ranking search results?

But its a long way to go here in India. Bill Slawski says: 04/18/2016 at 12:24 pm Hi Bharat, It’s an interesting idea, that Google has developed this process that is primarily based upon the use of a mobile phone, with a rear facing camera built into it. It shows that Google is interested in developing for users who connect to the Web using smart phones. And Google did develop the Android One (https://www.android.com/one/) which looks like it would possibly work with this process. The Android One was developed with India in mind, as a first smartphone. So maybe there might not be such a long way to go in India. Anindya says: 04/18/2016 at 1:46 pm i appreciate with Bharat Lohakare !! Bill Slawski says: 04/18/2016 at 2:44 pm Hi Anindya, Some really interesting stuff is coming from Google Corey Northcutt says: 04/18/2016 at 10:04 pm Fascinating stuff Bill, definitely passes the “if I were Google” test. Hoping that Google’s implementation is a decade or two ahead of the current Microsoft Cognitive Services API before it gets treated as a worthwhile signal. Bill Slawski says: 04/18/2016 at 10:18 pm Hi Corey, I pays off to pay attention to what Microsoft is doing, too. The Cognitive Services API (https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/apis) has some interesting elements to it. Thanks for pointing it out. Andrew Isidoro says: 04/19/2016 at 1:41 am Another cracking find BIll. I think it’s an interesting approach but would, I imagine, be pretty inaccurate. Those with facial problems, ticks or even those wearing glasses could cause a number of false positives (or negatives). I’d also be interested to hear why privacy advocates would say about it 😉 I think the most interesting thing about this and other patents (like this one – http://www.seobythesea.com/2014/09/google-patent-watch-tv-as-ranking-signal/) is the variety of ways Google are investigating to optimise results. Walid says: 04/19/2016 at 3:48 am Is this can really become a search engine signals ? I mean what kind of biometric signals could be used by Google if I m searching for “Funeral Service Chicago” One friend is asking me if I m used to smile when I found a pizzeria 🙂 Gayatri says: 04/19/2016 at 4:49 am a good article keval says: 04/19/2016 at 5:05 am I think it is possible but i am doubtful about its success because if i found something on google which i want that does not mean i will have a positive emotion on my face. toni says: 04/19/2016 at 5:12 am I love your post. Brill.. exciting but scary 🙂 Victor says: 04/19/2016 at 6:33 am Hey Bill, Just dropping several thoughts and two links. Long time fan of your work. People are usually emotionless in front of screens. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so here’s two artists that have been trying to capture that void in emotions when people are plugged into the information devices: “People Staring at Computers” https://player and “Removed,” where a photographer who captures people using their mobile devices but post-edits and removes the devices http://www.removed.social/ . I’d also argue context also matters. If I’m in a hurry, I’m probably going to have my flustered face on regardless of the query. If I was interrupted or multi-tasking, then there’d be a confounding variable to my emotion that wasn’t due to my search result. So while interesting in theory, I’d be very surprised if this patent ever took off. Then again, maybe ML will figure out if changes to my iris signal satisfaction or dissatisfaction, all the while recommending that I go see a doctor. Bill Slawski says: 04/19/2016 at 7:29 am Hi Victor, Thanks for sharing those links and you research. Interesting stuff there. The patent refers to human raters a number of times, reminding us that Google has been working with humans in testing processes like this one out, and I suspect they would while testing the process behind this patent. Google acquired the company Wavvi, which did research before the acquisition on using sensors to detect if people were coming down with illnesses. So that recommendation to go see a doctor, if one comes out, might be worth listening to. Bill Slawski says: 04/19/2016 at 7:31 am Hi Toni, It’s interesting seeing possibilities like this being researched and considered. Will Google develop a process like this? We can be certain, but we know now that they’ve thought about it. Bill Slawski says: 04/19/2016 at 7:32 am Hi Gayatri, Thank you! Bill Slawski says: 04/19/2016 at 7:37 am Hi Walid, If you’ve had a site show up in a search that you had a bad experience at; you might possibly frown as a response. Interesting question about the funeral service – there may be questions that wil likely evoke some type of emotional response when searched for. I imagine that if such a system is developed, it should be tested carefully. Bill Slawski says: 04/19/2016 at 7:42 am Hi Andrew, If Google launches something like this, I imagine they will do a lot of testing with their many human evaluators. They would probably collect a lot of data about biometrics while they are as well. I suspect that they have turned this over to people who specialize in privacy issues as well, for their thoughts about how to present something like this to the public – it’s not going to reveal personally identifiable information to the public about any one person but I would like to see how they might address concerns about privacy. Bill Slawski says: 04/19/2016 at 8:33 am Hi Keval, I don’t know if Google’s concerned with showing results that people are positive about as much as they want to not show results that people aren’t very happy about (that is the impression I get after reading their example about a person’s reaction to a restaurant they didn’t like very much showing up in search results.) Corey Northcutt says: 04/19/2016 at 10:31 am Walid raises a great point; I have to imagine that for something like this to work, it needs to be accompanied by a new method of segmenting queries. We already basically know that it’s done for commercial queries, where the topic+intent is timely (QDF), and likely others. Maybe we start to think about a Query Deserves Happiness? I’ll sit and watch for that headline to scroll by. Although it’s probably simpler. I suspect we’d just see Satisfaction compared with a more primitive signal like Task Completion Time to dynamically weight it in situations that it works better. Or instead, we’ll see more RankBrain press telling us that A/B testing the weightings of signals vs. queries using automation is too complicated for our non-AI brains to comprehend. Alan Whiteside says: 04/20/2016 at 2:19 am Hi Bill Another great post Bill. I agree with Andrew in terms of privacy concerns. However how much attention do people actually pay to the privacy T&C’s on the apps, or possible “cross contamination” of data between apps. A lot of the data you are looking at here is already being collected by the current plethora of health apps and devices that are available. Laura Sultan says: 04/20/2016 at 4:56 am The implications of this technology are far-reaching. Privacy issues aside, it’s easy to imagine how this might factor into RankBrain or some of their other AI projects, as well as applications in IOT devices. Aurélien says: 04/20/2016 at 7:01 am It will not be legal “to spy” on us, and certain subjects entrainent more or less emotion, I have doubts about an approach like this one. Bill Slawski says: 04/20/2016 at 7:20 am Hi Laura, It will be interesting to see if Google might adopt this; and how they might address those privacy concerns. Bill Slawski says: 04/20/2016 at 7:25 am Hi Alan, Thanks. The types of data collected by other apps may be similar, but it is definitely used in different ways, so I’m not sure how much of an argument that makes when it comes to the collection and use of that data. I think that the fact that such data wouldn’t be collected and used in personally identifiable ways is a better argument in favor of its use (but I’m still wondering how many people would still find it invasive anyway). Bill Slawski says: 04/20/2016 at 7:30 am Hi Aurelien, That is the reaction that I suspect that many people will have to the process described in this patent. I guess we will wait and see if it is something that Google tries to develop and use. Liam O'Dowd says: 04/20/2016 at 10:05 am Bill, I love this blog for some of the patent insights it brings. I’ve been reading about VR and MR (mixed reality) today, where they could go etc. Combined with wearables, retina recognition, cameras on devices, hell even IoT data, tech companies like Google are going to be looking at how they can interoperate our ‘real world’ movements to their benefit more and more over the coming decade. Wouldn’t be surprised to envisage a scenario where you search for a food product on Google, and Google then looks out to see if that product ends up in your kitchen as indicated by an RFID chip in the packaging, using that as a positive ranking signal if it does. Fascinating, maybe a little frightening too. Liam (PS – has that been patented? If not, I’m on the case!) Ashwati says: 04/22/2016 at 2:24 am Hi Bill, Interesting feature to implement. Do you think if one were to run an experiment if this rolls out, to understand if it really is capturing the user’s need to be satisfied. A small one like the one Rand Fishkin had tried to understand the true nature of Pogosticking, which also had a lot to do with the idea of understanding if the user was satisfied with the result. But this obviously works on a greater level to understand the satisfaction parameter. I wish it were possible to pick up focus groups of 20 around the globe and try to look for a generic query and show a consistent disregard for the query that ranks first and see if the search result is affected in any way. It is just interesting to understand how much power the user has over the results, now that such a feature is out there. HARISH NEGI says: 04/22/2016 at 9:53 am It is really difficult to satisfy every audience for their search term, they are bound to go and check other articles available in the web. Checking their like & dislike for a article will be difficult task for google. But lets hope the best article finds the top place in the google search. Things are also going to be tough for SEO experts. What I think is to keep the things simple and to the point, instead of having all those wasteful ticks to rank. Thanks for sharing ! Pedro says: 04/22/2016 at 10:59 am I’ve never heard about this but it seems perfect to me. If this tecnology is already ready to run there is nothing more sensitivy than capture the person reaction. Congratulation for the article. Bill Slawski says: 04/22/2016 at 1:11 pm Hi Pedro, It’s difficult to say whether or not Google has put this into place, or whether they might say something about it if they do try to use it. I guess we wait and see. Bill Slawski says: 04/22/2016 at 1:15 pm Hi Harish. The focus of the process behind this patent seems to be to capture an emotional response, if one exists, to a business behind a website, rather than the website itself. It doesn’t involve any tricks for ranking of sites, nor any manipulation or spamming of the search engine. For a positive response, it seems like the site behind a result would have to create a positive response to a person viewing a site in search results. Bill Slawski says: 04/22/2016 at 1:21 pm Hi Ashwati, The process behind this patent is to measure an actual response from a searcher to seeing a particular business in search results in response to a query; not to guess at one based upon a metric like a quick return to search results, like what might happen when pogosticking takes place (which is still only a guess at whether or not a visitor to a site enjoyed or didn’t like a site. The patent talks about using human raters to build a model about sites with, so Google is possibly experimenting with their own focus groups. Difficult to say how much control a searcher has over the ranking of results based upon this method. But if they don’t like one of the results based upon a possible bad experience with them in the past, they may not like seeing that result for a query to begin with. Bill Slawski says: 04/22/2016 at 1:25 pm Hi Liam, I can’t say that I’ve seen a patent about food products, like you surmise, but that is an interesting idea. It’s possible that the internet of things, with sensors in household appliances may lead to a search engine producing a device like you are suggesting. It’s possible that we may see something like that developed; or you may develop it. 🙂 Jack Jones says: 04/24/2016 at 4:06 pm Hey Bill If this is true then this is truly amazing, imagine capturing a persons expression due to search results and some kind of AI understanding that expression! Its actually a little creepy to be honest that Google would even apply to patent this. Bharat says: 04/24/2016 at 11:04 pm google is trying to refine search results as much as. It is a helpful step. Alan Clarc says: 04/25/2016 at 2:45 am I would like to encourage all of you really like your blog. Did you design this website yourself or did you hire someone to do it for you? Please reply as I’m looking to create my own blog and would like to find out where u got this from. Many thanks bookmark this page to your most used service to help get the word out. Street View for Business says: 04/25/2016 at 5:13 am Well, its been evolving all the time, so can’t be predictable whats behind the wall. Though good piece of content. David Eichholtzer says: 04/25/2016 at 9:25 am Hi Bill, Very interesting, but wow it’s really scary (for an european guy :-)) I do not think Google will ever use it in Europe, we have so many legal locks! David James says: 04/25/2016 at 10:32 am Hi Bill, Great post and definitely food for thought. I’ll start optimising for smiles. Bill Slawski says: 04/25/2016 at 10:35 am Hi James, I think most businesses would benefit by optimizing their businesses with the intent of making their customers smile. Bill Slawski says: 04/25/2016 at 10:37 am Hi David, Google doesn’t say that they would in any way share this information, which definitely would be something I think most people concerned with privacy would be upset about. We don’t know if Google will ever start using this process, but it’s possible that they might. I guess we wait and see. Bill Slawski says: 04/25/2016 at 10:38 am Thanks, It’s interesting seeing something that surprises a little like this from Google. We’ll see if it’s a direction that Google will take. Bill Slawski says: 04/25/2016 at 10:40 am Hi Alan, Thank you. I’ve been using a template that I’ve made a number of updates to Bill Slawski says: 04/25/2016 at 10:42 am Hi Jack. I don’t think applying for a patent in itself is a creepy step. The idea of measuring emotional responses isn’t either. If they had proposed within the patent that they would use images collected from this process, that would be creepy. 🙁 Keir harness says: 04/26/2016 at 12:39 am Maybe it’s related more to a device like glass where the tech can have sensors closer to facial muscles/ pulse etc to measure response. You can already see the blog posts….10 ways to raise your visitors biometrics. 😆 Aleksandar Neparno says: 04/26/2016 at 2:58 am That’s really fascinating. I believe it’s for the future, though, but with every new system like this life we are living more and more looks like Sci-Fi movie. And to add a bit of fun into this, I’m thinking about situation where searcher find some really ugly website and laugh, so Google can misunderstand laugh and rank funny-ugly website higher. 🙂 Andy Kuiper says: 04/26/2016 at 8:33 am …porn sites will be ‘RANKING’ now lol 😉 Alexes says: 04/27/2016 at 6:08 am Hey. Interesting post but I don’t want Google to capture my facial impressions. I hear many news about that and someone says that G already trying that type of spying. So how we could protect ourselves ? Vinodh Ramakannan says: 04/27/2016 at 6:18 am Very interesting article Bill! Infact, I have been reading quite a bit of your blogs recently and I should its totally stuff that I dont find in many places and YES I believe satisfaction is going to be a ranking signal in the future. Further to some of the points you have mentioned, there are a few companies that are working on BCI (Brain Computer Interface) to study customer satisfaction. Bill Slawski says: 04/27/2016 at 7:48 am Hi Vinod, I try to keep an eye on what is being posted about Google and search engines in other places; and provide information here that is unique if I can. Yes, I’ve seen some articles about Brain Computer Interfaces, but for much more than just studying customer satisfaction. We do live in interesting times. Bill Slawski says: 04/27/2016 at 7:52 am Hi Alexes, I’ve read a number of articles that talk about people taping tape or post-it notes over the cameras that are on their desktop computers. I don’t know what is available out there to make sure that the camera on your phone isn’t on and your image is being captured; but I suspect there likely is something that is available if you look. I was surprised to come across this type of recording of expressions; and curious if Google would tell us whether they were using it, and what words they would use to do so. Lucy Kirkness says: 04/28/2016 at 4:43 am This is petrifying, yet fascinating at the same time. I wonder what the pro-privacy advocates will be saying about this… Bill Slawski says: 04/28/2016 at 7:38 am Hi Lucy, I am interested in the response of pro-privacy advocates to this also – I haven’t see any so far Michael Romano says: 05/05/2016 at 2:19 pm Creepy. This technology sounds cool to be sure… but creepy. Bill Slawski says: 05/06/2016 at 10:33 am Hi Micheal, What felt scary to me about it is that I could see Google using information like this, and it actually being helpful to them. 🙂 Gorilla Marketing says: 05/07/2016 at 9:14 am Awesome article again Bill. Doesn’t surprise me this is something they are looking at. We are well aware they are already looking at things like CTR and user engagement on a website through analytics / return to SERP rate – why would they not do what they can to see how the other results are faring up. Creepy how big brother it is, but deffo something to consider. Again – thanks for the awesome content you put on here, I never spend the time to thank you after taking away so much. Good luck with everything you are up to and look after yourself. Kyle Gorilla Marketing Bill Slawski says: 05/07/2016 at 11:04 am Hi Kyle, Thank you. It is interesting seeing the things that Google might consider doing to rank search results. Claire Greenhow says: 05/09/2016 at 12:29 pm Gosh, I’m not really sure I like that idea. It feels a bit like they’ll be spying on me more than I’d feel comfortable with. Technology is awesome but sometimes it’s taken a step too far. Bill Slawski says: 05/09/2016 at 6:04 pm Hi Claire, I guess it is possible to take things a little too far. It’s still an interesting idea, but I suspect that Google might think about this, and decide that people might consider it to be a little too intrusive. I guess we wait and see if they come out with it. Hubert Jason says: 05/11/2016 at 1:43 am Interesting article…Thank you so much for this knowledgeable post sharing with us. alisha bacon says: 05/16/2016 at 10:29 am That’s really cool! I’d be interested to see how it improves the browsing experience. AAMIR SIDDIQUI says: 05/19/2016 at 10:12 pm @Bill, This is no doubt a very great technology by observing the user intent and psychological behavior, emotions and sentiments G can get to know which query is most valuable and which results should not come much often on a particular set of keywords. This is a kind of good judgment process G has initiated. And now its more like human than a bot which can think and make decisions as well. Good Going Google and nice post Bill! 🙂 Sukanta Das says: 05/26/2016 at 11:51 am Brilliant thinking by Google family. Nice attempt to serve their users at their level best. Really Fantastic idea! Rob Stoubos says: 05/26/2016 at 1:04 pm Hi Bill, Very interesting idea/concept. Personally I’m not sure users would want their facial expressions to dictate how Google serves them results and in which order. If you have a face like the grumpy cat then surely it will mislead Google, lol. Google are also always commenting on respecting people’s privacy. I personally wouldn’t like it recording my facial expressions through my mobile phone. However, this is Google, as some of the comments have stated, if they can gather even more data on mood, gender, expressions etc. then they probably will try to do it just to get even more data. Bill Slawski says: 05/31/2016 at 6:19 pm Hi Rob I wonder if Google starts using a process like this one, if they will tell us whether or not they are using it. I’m guessing they might not. Bill Slawski says: 05/31/2016 at 6:30 pm Hi AAMIR, Thanks! This patent appears to be focusing upon actual reactions from people who might have experiences with places that might appear in search results, rather than just keywords – it is a matter of an emotional response to a thing, rather than to a string or words. It really is a consideration of whether someone might really “like” something listed in search results, rather than pushing a button to show their like or dislike. Mary says: 06/01/2016 at 8:37 am This sounds pretty cool! sean says: 06/11/2016 at 2:38 am Yeahh…It may be in future. But sounds good. Google is updating daily it’s search algorithm and trying to provide better search results to users. So I don’t think it is a shocking news. Jake Eggie says: 06/18/2016 at 2:23 pm First Lets Look at Pros and Cons of this technology pros: 1. Improved search result 2. satisfaction Cons 1. Privacy Issue 2. Wrong capturing of facial expressions may result in search query variation Above things to taken care of for effective utilization of technology Ben says: 07/01/2016 at 6:46 am Isn’t this what they tried to achieve using google plus – I have no idea why they dropped this in the search, or authorship for that matter … Bill Slawski says: 07/01/2016 at 10:14 pm Hi Ben, Google+ gave Google a chance to have people share content from the Web, and interact with others and learn about their interests and their expertise. It was a different approach than this Biometric approach, used for somewhat different reasons and in different ways. Google+ just turned 5 years old, and it is still ongoing. It is not a ghost town, and likely provides Google with significant data and information about people who use it and interact with others. We don’t know if Google is using this biometric approach; but if they do, I wonder if they would tell us whether or not they are. Ish Sarwar says: 07/12/2016 at 12:15 pm Hi, It sounds quite interesting. I wonder if this actually happens. Thanks John Borcia says: 08/13/2016 at 8:07 am Wow, this is very interesting. I wonder what exactly they’ll do with this. It seems very weird and kind of creepy for them to use the camera to monitor user’s facial expressions. Christianihechi says: 08/19/2016 at 8:46 am Haha. That sounds pretty good to me. If this is put to work, its really gonna help bring down irrelevant sites from the top that are always hanging there. I kinda like it though. But looking at how its gonna work, there would be complaints of users privacy being invaded. Google wouldn’t just be seeing your face alone unless the camera is just focusing on your forehead. Since most Android phones with internet browsing dont have good front facing cameras or dont have it at all, this might pose some limitations to the technology. I was like, how can all these be gotten from the front camera? 1..Increased body temperature 2..Pupil dilation 3.. Eye twitching 4.. Facial flushing 5..Decreased blink rate 6.. Increased heart rate. Wouldnt it lower the system speed? Will an average or midrange device with poor front facing cameras be able to cope? Will it force oems to make all their phones possess advanced cameras or if possible iris recognition technology? This i not going to be accepted worldwide especially in security conscious regions. All the same, its gonna be cool. Bill Slawski says: 08/19/2016 at 11:02 pm Hi Christianihechi, It will be interesting seeing if Google adopts this satisfaction approach using a phone’s camera to measure biometric indications. I imagine that it’s possible that Google could move forward with this approach even if only a small percentage of phones could possibly be used in this process. We don’t know if Google will use this – or if they will announce that they are using it, if they decide to start. Calgary SEO Solutions says: 09/10/2016 at 3:12 pm Great read! Somethin to think about, that is for sure! Who knows what’s coming next 🙂 Steven Clark says: 09/15/2016 at 7:07 pm Future SEO could get very, very, weird. Richa Kapoor says: 09/23/2016 at 11:57 pm It’s really interesting to know that google is trying its best to deliver all these services to us. But I have a question in mind.. Don’t you think that after the implementation of facial expression, the search engine would show only the results based on our queries and searches that we made on google in the past and won’t show us the latest generic results? Bill Slawski says: 09/24/2016 at 10:02 am Hi Richa, There’s nothing in the patent that would indicate that the use of biometrics as described in the patent would negatively impact previous searches or present day searches. It is also difficult to tell exactly how a new process might impact search; but it’s likely that Google would work as hard as possible not to let the introduction of a new process have too profound of an effect upon searchers – I don’t think they would want searchers to think that search is broken, and would avoid that as much as possible. Graeme Winchester says: 10/25/2016 at 1:14 am Food for thought but there are so many variables that I think it would be difficult to implement in the real world. Wouldn’t put it past them to try something like this though. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

At the Monday meeting of The Dalles City Council, representatives from Google and Gorge Networks described their efforts to keep the wireless internet service — which is free and available to the public — operating smoothly. The public system went operational in 2011, thanks to a grant from Google of approximately $400,000, and Hood River-based Gorge Networks was subsequently chosen to install and operate the system. Now, modernization is needed, and Google is providing a fresh grant of $95,500 to pay for the improvements. “We are happy to support this, but if we are going to fund it, we want it to be fast and accessible,” explained Darcy Nothnagle, Google’s head of external affairs in Seattle. At first, the free Wi-Fi coverage area primarily blanketed the downtown business district of The Dalles. The system started with 40 access points, but since then the coverage area has doubled with more than 50 new access points added. In the five years since the service was provided, it has been expanded into 12 additional public sites, including the Civic Auditorium, rodeo grounds, Sorosis Park, Kramer Field, Riverfront Park and the Discovery Center. “Each day, access to the internet becomes more and more important for finding a good job, accessing services or information, and learning – as so many students in school today require the internet to complete the assignments,” Nothnagle said. “This wireless network provides those resources. Google’s mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, and providing access to the internet helps people connect with information,” Nothnagle explained.“This gives The Dalles a real edge as far as technology goes over anybody in this part of the state,” added Gorge Networks representative Dave Keleher during Monday’s council meeting. Dan Bubb, president of Gorge Networks, explained in a written report to the city council that some of the Wi-Fi hardware now in place will not be workable by 2017, and the focus will be on replacing that equipment. “The most significant upgrades included in that specification were an increase in system capacity from a 3M to 15M user experience and the use of the 5GHz frequency that allowed for better/faster coverage,” Bubb wrote. “The original technology is no longer up to date or meeting code,” Keleher added. “There are 40 access points in the downtown area, and we are migrating those to the newest technology. We are increasing band width and taking old access points and replacing them with new access points,” he explained. Keleher said that would serve to “improve meshing and connectivity as people move around the city.” According to the Gorge Networks report, the Wi-Fi system currently has approximately 700 to 800 users every day, and Gorge.net statistics showed more than a doubling in the number of users in August 2016 as compared to August 2015. “We attribute this to the system being faster, more reliable, and there being more awareness of the availability of the system,” Bubb noted. “We consider the Wi-Fi system to be highly successful based on the several hundred users that utilize the system every day.” City Councilor Dan Spatz asked whether the upgrading project will include additional enhancements to address cyber-security. “The system is a much more secure network than when it was first rolled out,” Keleher replied. “This will add another layer of improvements.” Mayor Steve Lawrence said he appreciates that Google is stepping up to support the community. “Google feels very good about being located in The Dalles,” Lawrence said. “They like the atmosphere, the style of living, and they want to give back in other ways.” “They provide computers to the school system; they have provided a huge contribution to the library for internet and computer training, including 3-D manufacturing instruction; and they have made a commitment to providing internet services in the downtown,” Lawrence added. “We’re proud to provide funding for this public Wi-Fi network to increase access for all residents of and visitors to The Dalles,” Nothnagle said.

Leadership Operations Is Toronto a better startup environment than Silicon Valley? Google’s engineering head thinks so Eric Emin Wood @ericewood Published: October 29th, 2016 When it comes to tech startups, Steve Woods knows what he’s talking about. Before he became Google Canada’s senior engineering director, Woods founded and ran three Silicon Valley startups, including early voice portal Quack.com, which was sold to AOL in 2000, and online game advertising platform NeoEdge Networks. All three were funded with venture capital from Toronto and Boston, he says. Not one penny came from the Bay Area. “I pitched more than 200 times, and I have a lot of friends who are venture capitalists, but none of them gave me any money,” Woods says. “And while I was building these companies with money I’d raised elsewhere, I realized I was hiring people from Waterloo, from Toronto, and spending my funds to move them to one of the most expensive places in the country to live, supposedly to grow my companies.” “Eventually I realized, ‘This is crazy – not everybody wants to move to the United States,'” he continues. “So I started growing companies with engineering teams in Toronto and Waterloo.” Tapping into the Toronto-Waterloo corridor’s talent pool gave Woods an appreciation for Canada’s startup ecosystem that he did his best to articulate and share as the driving force behind Google Canada’s recent Go North conference, which invited more than 500 startups to Toronto on Oct. 28. “If you’re starting a company I think it’s possible to realize that the density of startups and talent in the Toronto-Waterloo corridor means you don’t need to go to Silicon Valley,” he says. “In fact, maybe you shouldn’t.” The difference between Canada and Silicon Valley’s startup ecosystems is difficult to define, he admits, and hard to understand until you’ve lived in the U.S. for a significant enough period of time (Woods spent 11 years there). But in addition to their world-famous kindness, Canadians are vibrant, educated, intelligent – and loyal, he says. “If you’re creating a startup you need loyalty,” Woods says, “because things aren’t always great. There are a lot of hard days, and your people can walk away, because they’re easily employable, so you want people who are committed, who don’t feel like they’re just doing it for themselves – and in Canada you get that.” Like Silicon Valley, Canada’s tech culture values entrepreneurialism, but more importantly it has the educational infrastructure and hands-on training – not to mention a reputation that attracts the world’s best and brightest – to back it up. “With [Google’s] entrepreneur programs, we’ll quite often go into a place where there’s a lot of interesting things happening, but there’s no hub or centre for it, and we’ll put our money into trying to build that environment,” he says. “We didn’t need to build that in Waterloo because it already has one – Communitech operates almost exactly like an entrepreneur hub – and so we want to be part of that environment in another way.” Woods became involved with Google 10 years into his startup career, in 2008, when the company approached him with an opportunity to build engineering and product teams in Canada for them. He doesn’t recall his first reaction being enthusiastic: “I go, ‘I dunno, you seem like a big company,'” he says. “And they go, ‘We’re big, but we’re not a big company. Come with us, invent things in Canada with our money, and it will be fun.'” Since then, Woods says that he’s come to think of Google not as a singular entity, but a series of teams developing and executing projects under a single umbrella vaguely supervised by Alphabet Inc. CEO and Google co-founder Larry Page, Alphabet president and Google co-founder Sergey Brin, and Google Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai. Because of the wide variety of projects under development beneath that umbrella, Google values diversity, Woods says – and in addition to their work ethic, the Toronto team’s embrace of cultural diversity has served as a model for others to emulate as well. “We want to have different cultures contributing,” he says. “The teams in Canada don’t build products which are Canadian-based, they’re worldwide based.” Which brings us back to Go North. In addition to hosting the event in Toronto, Google broadcast what Woods hopes will be an inaugural conference on YouTube and even pushed it on its home page. “We’re trying to put a spotlight on Canadian startups, making it clear for the whole world that we’re not just nice, we’re great,” Woods says. “Look at Thalmic. Look at Vidyard. These are amazing companies. We have a world-class environment here, and we want more people to know about it – to come to our country when they create their company and build the next great BlackBerry or Google here.” Post to Twitter Post to Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share with Google+ More Articles Google plans to split $5M among Canada’s 10 most innovative non-profits Phishing scam that hooked Clinton's campaign chief a cautionary tale for businesses Leadership, Operations Google, Google Canada, startups About Eric Emin Wood Eric Emin Wood is an Associate Editor at IT World Canada.

The news may come as a disappointment to those who were hoping the search giant would bring competition and faster speeds to their area. So, what happened? Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg, 2014   Brian Fung The Washington Post     After rolling out its Fiber product in about a dozen cities, Google is hitting pause on its project to deploy super-fast Internet across the country. The news may come as a disappointment to those who were hoping the search giant would bring competition and faster speeds to their area. So, what happened? Here are a few explanations for Tuesday's announcement. (The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.) --- Financial pressure from higher-ups Like many of its siblings in the broader Alphabet family, Google Fiber is likely feeling the heat from top executives who are trying to show investors that their money is being well spent. Remember when Google restructured itself last year? The move effectively divided Google into two parts: the one that makes a lot of money -- the core business, which includes search, YouTube and many of the other consumer-facing services you think of when you think "Google"; and the one that spends a lot of money, which includes Fiber, Nest and its famous moonshot lab, X. This second half of the business has been under intense pressure to demonstrate results. That's why Astro Teller, the head of X, had to write a blog post essentially defending his department's reason to exist. It's why Google sought to spin off Boston Dynamics, which was reportedly spending too much time and money building products nobody would buy. And it's partly why there's been controversy surrounding Nest, the smart-thermostat maker. Although chief financial officer Ruth Porat cited Fiber as one of Alphabet's top performers in one of the first earnings calls after the restructuring, it seems as though no part of Alphabet has been able to escape the deeper financial scrutiny that came along with it. --- Not enough demand Just like Google Glass -- the company's ill-fated attempt to build an augmented-reality visor -- Google Fiber may be just a little ahead of its time. The thing about Fiber and businesses like it is that most consumers simply can't find a use for that much bandwidth yet. Google Fiber provides gigabit connectivity, which is orders of magnitude faster than what many Americans get in their homes today. Unless you're a corporation that operates a data center or runs a cloud computing business, you probably don't need a gigabit connection. As Vox points out, even the most data-hungry applications -- ahem, Netflix -- only require a 25 Mbps connection at the most. That's 1/40th the amount of bandwidth a Google Fiber connection provides. Our consumption of broadband is undoubtedly going to increase as we connect more devices to the Internet and those devices communicate in more sophisticated ways. But for now, Fiber is reportedly missing its subscriber goals, indicating there may not be enough demand for that level of service. --- Big incumbents made Google's job harder Google had an unenviable task in many of its chosen cities: It had to compete with large, established broadband providers who were already there or could benefit from regulations that raised the bar for new entrants. To counter the problem, Google tried something novel. It got cities to compete for Google's favor. The company basically said, "We'll come to your city if you complete this checklist of tasks that will make our lives easier." If a city proved itself worthy of Google Fiber -- by easing the permitting or construction process, for example -- then it increased the likelihood that it would be next on the list to receive Google's high-speed service. This arrangement sometimes resulted in cities doing things that the big incumbents didn't like. Louisville, Kentucky, for example, approved a city ordinance that would have let Google move cables around on utility poles that it didn't own. AT&T sued, saying the move was illegal and violated federal rules. Google responded by accusing AT&T of hindering competition. In Nashville, AT&T and Comcast have sued to defeat a similar measure. These fights are part of a larger battle among industry titans to determine how the market for broadband functions. Under one approach, it's much harder for companies like Google Fiber to get started. Under another approach, it gets easier. The problem for Google is that engaging in these fights can be a costly distraction beyond the already-substantial expense of laying down high-speed networks. --- Providing bundled TV is expensive There was another major cost Google had to account for when offering its Fiber service. Americans love their double- or triple-play bundles, which reduces the cost of buying Internet from traditional providers. To get customers to switch to Fiber, Google had to offer a compelling TV service of its own. And that meant doing all the same things a regular cable company does, such as pay channels like ESPN or HBO for their content. The cost of acquiring video content was "the single biggest impediment" to Google Fiber's wider rollout, a top Google Fiber executive, Milo Medin, told an audience in 2014. Compared to more established service providers, Medin said, Google was paying twice as much for video rights -- a cost that couldn't be avoided. --- Wireless broadband is the future Even as Google Fiber pays lots of money to lay down cables and secure access to TV programming, a different type of technology is coming down the pike: wireless fiber. In some respects, you can think of wireless fiber as similar to the 4G LTE you get on your cellphone -- it's a wireless way of getting data. But in other ways, it's a totally different ballgame. Verizon's version claims to be 50 to 100 times faster than LTE. AT&T is working on something called AirGig, which envisions a network of wireless hotspots mounted on utility poles that constantly beam out high-speed wireless signals. There are signs Google is moving in this direction, too. In June, it acquired Webpass, a provider of wireless broadband. Other acquisitions support this theory. And in its announcement Tuesday, Google Fiber said it would be looking at "new technology and deployment methods to make superfast Internet more abundant than it is today." So even if Google Fiber is on hold in its current incarnation, changes in technology may someday reduce the costs Google faces today. google-fiber Article Comments (0) Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Washington Post Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday November 15, 2016 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode Web email showdown: Gmail v Outlook.com Eric Ravenscraft 25 Apr 2016, 12:30 p.m. Despite Gmail's renown as one of the best email services on the internet, Microsoft's Outlook.com has spent the last few years building itself into a competent competitor. Web email showdown: Gmail v Outlook.com Gmail has been the de facto web email standard for a long time. But is it the best? Photo: Lifehacker Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit It's hard to think about email without putting a G in front of it. Despite Gmail's renown as one of the best email services on the internet, Microsoft's Outlook.com has spent the last few years building itself into a competent competitor. In today's showdown, we put these two behemoths of email to the test. The contenders There are a ton of email services, but a few have risen to the top. After Outlook.com absorbed Hotmail, Gmail and Outlook.com became the two biggest email services on the internet, together totalling over a billion users. Their approaches to managing your email are similar, but there are some pretty distinct differences in features. Gmail: Google's been leading the game in free online email since an April Fools prank in 2004 turned out to be real. With robust filters, labels, and 15GB of space to share between various Google services, Gmail successfully made us rethink how email works. As of May 2015, Gmail had over 900m active users. Outlook.com: In 2012, Microsoft launched a new web-based version of its Outlook email client. Later, Microsoft migrated all Hotmail users to Outlook.com. The fledgling service has a ton of unique features including Clutter, email rules, and integration with Outlook calendar. Microsoft says that Outlook users are limited to 5GB of space but "this slowly adjusts or increases according to your needs." Now the service boasts over 400 million active users. Note: for simplicity's sake, we'll be calling this service Outlook throughout this article, though technically Outlook (without the .com) is the desktop app. Yes, Microsoft's names are confusing. For our comparison, we'll be looking at the apps themselves, and not necessarily the underlying service underneath. Technically, you can import Gmail messages into Outlook and vice versa, but what we're interested in is how these websites actually work in practice. Gmail set the organisation standard, but Outlook has caught up We've covered how powerful Gmail's filters are and what you can do with them so extensively that we almost take them for granted. In Gmail, you can automatically sort emails by sender, keywords in the subject line or body, attachments, and by size. You can then use those filters to automatically mark messages as read, apply labels, respond with a canned message, delete them, and more. On top of this, Gmail uses labels and stars instead of folders. You can apply multiple labels to your messages, which gives you greater flexibility in setting up exactly the kind of organisation scheme you like, and stars let you set aside the most important emails for later. You can even enable Smart Labels that Google can apply labels like Finance and Travel automatically. Gmail also uses a priority inbox system to automatically find messages it believes are important to you. Emails are deemed "important" based on who you email, which messages you open, what you interact with and other criteria. You can also manually mark an email as important to help it learn. Outlook's approach to organisation is a little more complicated. For starters, the site uses folders as the primary method for organising your messages. By default, the left-hand pane shows a list of default folders, and you can create your own to organise your messages. You can pin emails so they remain at the top of a folder which is sort of but not exactly like Gmail's stars. Outlook also has a feature called Clutter that finds emails you probably don't care about and moves them to a separate Clutter folder. This lets you focus on your important messages and clear out the junk in one sweep. You can also add categories to your email, which function much like labels do. You can add categories and use those as criteria for rules (more on those in a second). However, by default, Outlook doesn't show you your categories in the navigation pane. To see any categories, you have to navigate to Options > Layout > Categories and manually pick which categories are shown. On the one hand, this makes it hard to clutter up your inbox unless you choose to — in contrast, Gmail shows all labels unless you specifically hide them — but on the other, it was a pain to even find the option. Similarly, Outlook's filter counterparts are called Rules (a term borrowed from the desktop version of Outlook). When you're viewing an email, you can create a Rule to filter messages like it. Otherwise, Rules are once again buried in Outlook's Options menu. They have many of the same options as Gmail's filters, but they're not quite as robust. For example, you can't automatically send a canned response based on a filter. However, for most situations, Rules and filters are pretty comparable. Outlook has a streamlined interface, but Gmail has several layouts to choose from I'm really excited about emailing myself. Google famously likes to play around with Gmail's interface, so you have a few different options to choose from. Most recently, Google introduced a tabbed inbox view that sorts your email into categories including Social for messages from social networking sites, Promotions for advertisement emails, and Updates for auto-generated emails like order confirmations or bills. For some, this was a godsend. Others wanted to turn it off immediately. On top of that, Google's also experimenting with Inbox, a third alternative interface for Gmail. Inbox treats your email more like a to-do list where you mark each message as "Done" rather than as "read." You can snooze emails until later and bundle related messages together. Between Inbox, Gmail's tabbed inbox, and the normal priority inbox interface, you have many options for choosing how to present your email. Gmail also has a ton of tweaks hiding in the Labs section of its settings. Here you can enable a ton of useful tweaks like a dedicated Mark as Read button, a Preview pane so you can read emails without leaving your message list, and canned responses. While many of these features are awesome tweaks that not everyone may want, some are also basic features that you probably shouldn't have to hunt down to enable in 2016. Outlook on the other hand uses a basic three panel design and sticks with it. On the left side, you can click on different folders and categories to navigate. In the middle panel, you'll see a list of emails in that folder. Click an email and you'll be able to read it in the third pane on the right. For anyone who's used an email client that isn't Gmail, it should look very familiar. Outlook doesn't have as many options for customising its interface in major ways as Gmail, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You can still tweak the basics like where your display pane shows up, or what order messages appear in a conversation. Finally, both Outlook and Gmail have ads, though they appear in very different ways. In Gmail, you'll see a couple of ads that look like regular emails under the Promotions tab. You can avoid them by turning off the promotions tab, disabling the tabbed inbox altogether, or using Inbox. In Outlook, the ads are full banners on the side of the screen. The only way (aside from ad blockers) to disable them is to pay $26/year for Ad-free Outlook. The silver lining, though, is that Microsoft promises Outlook won't scan your email to target ads. Gmail has a few bonus tricks, Outlook has a whole store of them No email client is an island. Google and Microsoft have a ton of other products built directly into their email client that make them pretty powerful. For simplicity, we'll only include the services that you can use without actually having to leave your Gmail or Outlook tabs directly. However, each company has quick shortcuts to tons of their other products, so part of your decision may be determined by which apps you use regularly every day. In Gmail, Hangouts lives as a panel on the right side of the screen. Every chat you open will appear along the bottom of your window. You can minimise them while you're checking your email and pop them open to reply to messages. You can also open a Tasks window that lives next to your open conversations so you can create a basic to-do list throughout the day. You can set due dates and provide descriptions for each task, but that's about it. In the Labs section, you can enable a mini-calendar widget so you can see a very abbreviated view of your agenda for the day. That's about all you can add to Gmail without downloading extensions to add services on top. In Outlook, you can use Skype for messaging just like Hangouts in Gmail. There's also a Tasks section you can open from the shortcut menu in the top-left corner of Outlook. Unlike Gmail's mini-Tasks widget, you can provide a ton more details for your tasks, including hours worked, set reminders for a task, and attach files from OneDrive to a task. On top of this, Outlook has a bunch of add-ins that expand your inbox's functionality. For example, you can open the Boomerang add-in to set a reminder to come back to an email after a few hours or days. You can open the Evernote add-in to save an email to one of your notebooks. There are over 100 more add-ins in the Office Store that can add new features to Outlook. The verdict: Gmail's friendly to power users, Outlook is awesome for office workers In the past, Gmail was the de facto standard for how to manage your email online. While Microsoft has done well with Outlook on desktops, it's only in recent years that its web email products have caught up. Now, it's a toss up as to which one is better, but each has their strengths. If you like endlessly tweaking or experimenting with your email setup, Gmail is for you. Google has not shied away from bold and controversial new designs that change how you use email. Sometimes those experiments work, sometimes they don't, and everyone has their preference. Even if you're not a fan of change, Gmail's foundation of powerful filters, customisable labels, and automatic sorting is solid and allows a ton of room for tweaking your inbox to bend it to your will. Outlook, on the other hand, is perfect for anyone who likes a streamlined workflow or uses a lot of professional productivity apps. Outlook puts the most relevant, important buttons right where you can see them and lets the power users go digging for options if they really want to. It also has deep ties not only to the rest of Microsoft's Office apps, but plugins like Boomerang, Evernote, and more. While Google's no slouch in the productivity department, Microsoft's Outlook feels the most at home in an office setting.

Image by: BECK DIEFENBACH / REUTERS About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. Save & Share Tweet Email Print The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet's Google, which crashed Apple's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85% of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach — more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google's Android operating system. The town that's got everything - except people  Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. "We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information," Rakowski said in an interview. Leaf from Apple's book The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. Great Wall of Africa on the cards  The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button." The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words "OK Google." By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google "doesn't have to do negotiations with another handset maker — they can make it as tight as they want," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. Google revives good landline  To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. Apple's privacy stance starting to eat into its bottom line  "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." WhatsApp dumps BlackBerry  Samsung going it alone? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. "If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator," said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. "They will be relegated to just pushing hardware." There’s an app to make you 'shark smart' in Cape Town  Google is coy about its plans. "Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible," Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant — such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company's earnings call on Thursday. Google adds fact-checking to news articles  "The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience," he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie," he said. "I approach this the same way."

Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Oct 29, 2016 at 7:00AM Image source: Yandex N.V. Yandex N.V. (NASDAQ:YNDX) released a better-than-expected third-quarter report on Thursday, and shares climbed 5% as a result. Let's have a closer look at how the Russian internet search leader kicked off the second half of the year. Yandex results: The raw numbers  Metric Q3 2016 Actual Q3 2015 Actual Growth (YOY) Revenue 19.29 billion RUR 15.44 billion RUR 25% Adjusted net income 3.79 billion RUR 3.51  billion RUR 8.2% Adjusted EPS (diluted) 11.61 RUR 10.89 RUR 6.6% Data source: Yandex N.V. *Figures in Russian rubles. YOY = year over year.  What happened with Yandex this quarter? Revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs -- which Yandex likens to sales commissions -- increased 28% year over year, to 15.56 billion RUR. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization grew 14% year over year, to 6.02 billion RUR. Shares of the Russian search market, including mobile, averaged 55.9% during the quarter, down from 57% and 57.6% in the second and first quarters of this year, respectively. According to Yandex management, this decline came primarily as Android market share fell slightly on a sequential basis given increased activity from Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google on its own applications through notifications other similar mechanisms. Desktop represented around 70% of total search traffic during the quarter, with a market share in Russia steady at around 64%. Mobile represented 30% of search traffic in Q3, with overall search share in the low 40% range. The difference here, according to Yandex management, is "mainly due to limited distribution opportunities on android and iOS mobile platforms." Search queries in Russia increased 5% year over year. Top-line gains were broad-based as usual, including: 21% growth in search and portal revenue, to 17.48 billion RUR. 45% growth in e-commerce revenue, to 1.2 billion RUR. 151% growth in taxi revenue, to 587 million RUR. 45% growth in classifieds revenue, to 352 million RUR. 98% growth in "experiments" revenue, to 210 million RUR, driven by media segments including KinoPoisk, Yandex.Radio, Yandex.Music, Yandex.Tickets, Yandex.Afisha, and Yandex TV programs. Total advertising revenue rose 22% year over year, to 18.44 billion RUR, representing 95.6% of total revenue. That figure includes: a 21% increase in revenue from Yandex websites, accounting ofor 70% of total revenue. 27% growth in ad network partner revenue, to contribute 26% of total revenue. "Other" revenue climbed 130% year over year, 853 million RUR, primarily driven by Yandex.Taxi. Aggregate paid clicks increased 12% year over year. Average cost per click increased 10% year over year. Regarding Yandex's antitrust complaint against Google, Yandex reminded investors that the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) issued a decision to Google to cease anti-competitive practices last year, followed by another positive ruling upholding that decision two quarters ago. But after a hearing in August, with which Yandex says the "FAS ruling came into force," Google still hasn't "implemented the FAS prescription." As such, according to Yandex chief operating officer Alexander Shulgin, "FAS opened an administrative investigation, considering Google's noncompliance was zeroed in." Shulgin further promised Yandex is monitoring the situation and will update investors as it changes. What management had to say "Revenue and EBITDA continued to grow strongly in Q3, boosted by innovation on our advertising platform," added Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh. "We see new opportunities in our geolocation services to drive revenues from our maps and navigation products." Shulgin added that Yandex achieved this growth while making large investments in its fastest-growing business units. In particular, Yandex is aggressively working to expand its Taxi market position and is accelerating Yandex.Market's transition to a cost-per-action model after "encouraging market tests." Looking forward As such, Yandex once again raised its full-year guidance and now anticipates that 2016 revenue will grow 22% to 24% year over year, up from previous guidance for 19% to 22% growth over 2015. In the end, Yandex's continued market share declines and legal struggles with Google notwithstanding, this was another strong quarter featuring broad growth across Yandex's portfolio of businesses. And assuming Google does formally comply with the FAS ruling, as Yandex expects it will, it should leave the company much better poised to reclaim some of the share it has lost on Big G's Android platform. So while I think investors would be wise to continue closely watching that situation as it unfolds, it was no surprise to see shares of Yandex up nicely following this report.

By Gregory Krieg and Tal Kopan, CNN Updated 8:19 AM ET, Sun October 30, 2016 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Clinton calls FBI director's actions unprecedented Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clinton calls FBI director's actions unprecedented 00:57 Story highlights Clinton campaign staffers believed attempted hack email was "legitimate" Cybersecurity experts see direct link to Russian cyberespionage group (CNN)A phishing email sent to Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta may have been so sophisticated that it fooled the campaign's own IT staffers, who at one point advised him it was a legitimate warning to change his password. The stolen email thread, released by WikiLeaks Friday, also provides the most direct evidence yet that the Russian government was behind the damaging hack into the Clinton campaign, according to a private cybersecurity company. The thread shows a Clinton campaign staffer writing that a phishing email sent to Podesta's Gmail account on March 19, 2016, is "legitimate," though the staffer advises him to go through Google's official procedures to update his password. It's not clear if Podesta gave hackers his password before he was advised by his staff, or if the email in question was the one that led to the hack. The Clinton campaign has not commented directly on the hacked emails and CNN cannot independently verify their authenticity. On its face, the source of the potentially dangerous email is Google, but a closer look at the actual mailing address shows an unfamiliar or bogus-looking account: "no-reply@accounts.googlemail.com." Read More The subject line warns, "Someone has your password" and the body of the message says "someone" in Ukraine tried, but was stopped, from signing into Podesta's account. "You should change your password immediately," the email warns. The words "CHANGE PASSWORD" then appear -- inviting Podesta to click on them -- as a way to do just that. But the address did not link to a secure Google web page, instead directing the user blindly via bit.ly, a service used to shorten or conceal web addresses. According to the cybersercurity company SecureWorks, the link used in the Podesta email was clicked two times. If his information was entered into a form on the landing site -- potentially run by a hacker -- the floodgates could have opened right there. Podesta was not the only Clinton campaign staffer targeted, SecureWorks found. "We saw 108 email addresses targeted and we know that 20 of the links that were sent to those individuals were clicked," Phil Burdette, a senior security researcher at the firm, told CNN on Friday. There were 213 similar bit.ly links created, he said, but because there were duplicates it is likely the same accounts received multiple phishing messages. It is unclear if anyone else targeted entered their information. The Russian connection The US government has pinned other cyberattacks targeting Democratic groups -- including the summer's hack of the Democratic National Committee -- on the Russian government, though it has not yet accused Moscow of the Podesta hack. Moscow has denied involvement. SecureWorks, however, says Friday's email thread provides proof of Russia's involvement in the Podesta hack. The group points to evidence that "Fancy Bear" -- the name of the cyberespionage group also believed to have carried out the allegedly Russia-led DNC hacks -- was involved in the Podesta thefts. "Fancy Bear" is a nickname for one of the Russian military-intelligence hacking groups that were discovered in the DNC's servers. Other cyberfirms have corroborated these findings, as has the US government. SecureWorks has linked the bit.ly account used in the Podesta phishing attack to "Fancy Bear." WikiLeaks has denied working with the Russians, though the group won't reveal its sources for the material it releases. Don Smith, the director of cyberintelligence at SecureWorks, said historically, the targeting of the bit.ly campaign appears aimed at military attaches in Western embassies, in addition to dissidents in Ukraine and Georgia and journalists outside Russia. But the phishing operation retrained its focus in March 2016, he said, employing the same tactics in an effort to breach the DNC and Clinton campaign staff email. "You don't have to think very hard to determine it was one of the Russian intelligence agencies," Smith said. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

Google Offers $50 Gift Cards to Some Customers Who Pre-ordered the Pixel Phones GO $50 Google Play store credit for missed delivery window Oct 29, 2016 10:54 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Google is among the many companies that can't cope with the increased demand for its products. It happened with just about every Nexus smartphone released in the past, and it's happening with the Pixel/Pixel XL as well. While the smartphones are still available for purchase, it usually takes a few weeks for a Pixel phone to reach its owner from the moment it was ordered. Apple has the same issue with the iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung had to gradually release the Galaxy Note 7 globally to handle the distribution of the phablet. The good news is Google really wants to take care of its fans who already pre-orderd the Pixel/Pixel XL, but have yet to receive it. One particular customer posted on Reddit the message he got from Google saying that he's going to receive a $50 Google Play store credit since the company missed the delivery window. Other customers who pre-ordered either of the two Pixel smartphones confirmed they were notified about the $50 gift card and the fact that it represents compensation for the missed delivery window. The Pixel family It's unclear whether this offer is only available in the United States, but most of those who received the gift cards pre-ordered their Pixel phones directly from Google's Play store and the delivery window was missed by at least 1 day. The $50 gift card is quite a lot for Google Play store where apps and games are usually free or much cheaper than iOS apps/games. Luckily, the $50 credit card applies to in-game purchases as well, which makes it even more valuable. You can read below the message received by many customers who pre-ordered the Pixel/Pixel XL and received $50 Google Play credit. Hello there, Thank you for your recent purchase on Google Store. We’re really excited for you to experience our new products, but we have some not-so-great news: It’s going to take a little longer for you to receive your package than we expected. We know this can be frustrating, but the good news is that we’ve shipped your order and it’s on its way. You should’ve already received a shipment confirmation email from us. We’re also going to send you a $50 Google Play credit via email soon after your package is delivered. Again, we’re so sorry — and thank you again for your order.

(Adam Foster/ CC BY 2.0) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains October 29, 2016 A team at Google has built a system to show that artificial intelligence can build its own form of encryption. While not very complex currently, this research could set the table for encryption that gets stronger as hackers attempt to crack it. To see if the artificial intelligence could learn to encrypt on its own, the AI researchers at Google Brain, a unit of the search company focused on deep learning, built a game with three entities powered by deep neural networks: Alice, Bob, and Eve. Alice was designed to send an encrypted message of 16 zeroes and ones to Bob, which was designed to decrypt the message. The two bots started with a shared key, a foundation for the message’s encryption. Eve was placed squarely in the middle, intercepting the information and attempting to decrypt it as well. To avoid Eve working out the encryption, Alice started transforming the message in different ways, and Bob adaptively learned how to shift his decryption to keep up. The researchers measured Eve’s success by how close it got to the correct message, Alice’s by whether Eve’s answer was further from the original message than a random guess, and Bob’s by whether he met a certain threshold for arriving at the right answer. The three networks were designed as generative adversarial networks, meaning they weren’t taught anything about encryption or shown examples of encrypted and decrypted messages. They learned by trying to outsmart each other. Bob, in red, quickly adapted to learn new encryption while Eve, in green, was unable to keep up. (Google) For the first 7,000 messages, Alice and Bob started out simply. Alice’s encryption was easy for Bob to figure out, but that meant it was easy for Eve to guess as well. But over the next 6,000 messages, Alice and Bob devised a kind of encryption that Eve simply couldn’t crack. Bob was able to reliably decrypt the message with no errors, while Eve consistently got seven or eight of the 16 characters wrong. Since the answers were either a zero or one, Eve would have had the same chances if it just flipped a coin. This kind of learning is done over thousands of iterations by a mosaic of mathematic weights being changed within the algorithms, so not even the researchers can understand how the encryption was built without an intensive and time-consuming analysis. While this was a simple test of whether AI can succeed at generating a form of encryption, it does spark questions about the future of security. Cryptography has always been a game of cat and mouse between those encrypting and those attempting to decrypt, constrained by the speed of modern computers. And while authors write that keeping data secure is more than just having strong encryption, cybersecurity might mean one day having AI agents fighting continually to protect your information, while others try to ferret it out.

Google Drive is the company's official desktop program that enables Google users to manage and sync files between their devices and the Google cloud. Today, we’re announcing that on January 1, 2017 we will discontinue support for the Google Drive desktop app on Windows XP, Vista and Server 2003 since these platforms are no longer actively supported by Microsoft. The Google Drive desktop app (officially: "Google Drive for Mac/PC") will continue to function on these platforms, but will not be actively tested and maintained. Two things are particularly interesting about the announcement. First, that the programs will continue to work. Google won't add a kill-switch to those programs or change compatibility information. This means that Windows users on XP, Vista or Server 2003 will be able to continue using the software for the foreseeable future. Google notes that it won't support, maintain or actively test new releases on these platforms. It seems likely that things will fail to work eventually, but not right away because of that. The second interesting observation is that Google mentions that these platforms are no longer actively supported by Microsoft. While that is indeed the case for Windows XP and Server 2003, it is not for Windows Vista. Windows Vista is in its extended support cycle currently which means that it will receive security updates just like any other supported version of Windows. Vista's extended support cycle ends in April 2017, but until that day, it is actively supported by Microsoft. Granted, Microsoft has all but forgotten about Vista and ignores it for the most part. Still, security updates are released on each Patch Tuesday, and will be until April 2017. Google recommends that Google Drive users on these platforms "move to a newer version of Windows to continue using" the Google Drive desktop app. Google Drive customers who run unsupported versions of Windows may use third-party clients instead should the official Google Drive desktop program stop working at one point. There is the free version of MultiCloud for instance, and you can always use the web version of Google Drive to manage files. The latter is not super comfortable for large file operations, but it is better than not being able to access the files at all anymore.

I found that the third party client called Syncdocs worked and syncs to a USB memory stick. Reply JR October 31, 2016 at 12:09 am # I really wish ALL software vendors would make this decision. XP and Vista need to go. NO one should be running those OS's in my opinion. Reply ilev October 31, 2016 at 8:17 am # Windows XP has more users than Windows 8+8.1. Why not stop ALL software support for this version of OS as well ? Reply marc klink October 31, 2016 at 1:45 am # Sounds like collusion between Microsoft and Google. Even if only on a small scale, it is still wrong. There are reasons for the disconnect with XP, but for Vista there is NO excuse other than spite from MS. Reply Rob November 1, 2016 at 6:07 pm # I guess I'm not seeing the problem. Just go to drive.google.com and drag your files in or tell it to download selected files.

Google tries new approach with voice on Pixel phone Reuters 10/29/2016 By Julia Love © REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach The Google Pixel phone is displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc's Google, which crashed Apple Inc's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 58.12 -0.90 -1.52% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google’s Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Corp’s Cortana. “We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information,” Rakowski said in an interview.  LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button.” The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words “OK Google.” By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google “doesn’t have to do negotiations with another handset maker – they can make it as tight as they want,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. “If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. “They will be relegated to just pushing hardware.” Google is coy about its plans. “Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible,” Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. “The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience,” he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it’s not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie,” he said. “I approach this the same way.” (Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Bill Rigby) Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From Reuters Trump win, Democratic setbacks cloud Pelosi's future as leader Reuters Hague prosecutors say U.S. forces may have committed war crimes Reuters Trump's team seeks top-secret clearance for his children - CBS News Reuters Trump's team seeks top-secret clearance for his children: CBS News Reuters Reuters View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Essentially, it's the same old Nexus launcher with a few changes in aesthetics. For example, the 6-dotted app drawer is replaced by a pull-up drawer to give you access to the apps installed on your smartphone. In order to get this launcher all you have to do is to download the Pixel Launcher's .apk file (download it here) and install it on your smartphone. Dial P for Pixel Google Pixel and Pixel XL come with an updated Phone app which goes by the name Dial P. Although most of the features remain unchanged in comparison to its previous versions (Google Phone app), the redesigned call screen and a few UI tweaks among others make it appealing. In case you want to check them out anyway, click here if you own a Nexus device or here if you own any other Android smartphone.   Pixel Camera App Another stock app to receive an update is the Google Camera App. Now known as the Pixel Camera, the app offers a slew of nifty features which can come in quite handy at times. For example, now you'll be able to manually control the exposure, AF/AE lock, and a few more. However, if you want to check out the new camera app, either you'll have to own a Nexus device or have Android 7.0 Nougat running on your Android smartphone (this is mandatory for the nexus devices as well). If you meet the eligibility criteria, you can download the app from here.   Google Assistant Undisputedly, Google Assistant is one of the USP's of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. The search-engine giant, while unveiling the smartphones, touted it as a full-fledged virtual Assistant (based on AI) which will help you get things done in a more efficient way. What makes the new AI assistant most helpful is the company's vast Knowledge graph which other companies (like Apple) can only dream of. If you want Google Assistant to get running on your smartphone follow the 7 simple steps listed here. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

"In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position."  Samsung going it alone?  Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones.  Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones.  Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said.  “If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. “They will be relegated to just pushing hardware.”  Google is coy about its plans. “Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible,” Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details.  Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant – such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located.  Google chief executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company’s earnings call on Oct 27.  “The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience,” he said.  But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google.  "As we went from desktops to mobile, it’s not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie,” he said. “I approach this the same way.” — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Analyst Reports , Corporate News , Life & Style , Technology You May Be Interested Tech up your cooking After Airbnb and Uber, wardrobe rental services could be the next travel trend Global industry groups voice opposition to China cybersecurity law Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Bluetooth connectivity issues might have to do with the hardware or software, and Google is investigating.  ( Spencer Platt | Getty Images ) Advertisement Google has its Pixel smartphones loaded with many powerful specs and features, such as the camera and Android 7.1 Nougat, but some problems are already showing up. Reports from Pixel and Nexus phone owners are piling up that the devices are showing unstable Bluetooth pairing and connectivity. Bluetooth In-Car Connectivity Specifically, it looks like an increasing number of users are having trouble connecting their phones to their smart cars via Bluetooth. What is more, once the phones finally connect to the cars, the link is unstable and can break at any moment. At the time of the writing, it is only speculation on what is causing the problem to occur, and Google has not made any official statement about the background of the issues. Some believe that the Pixel and Pixel XL are to blame, but others point out that the issue might lie with Android 7.1 Nougat, as the Bluetooth connectivity issue happens in the Nexus devices sporting the latest Google OS, as well. It is best to wait for Google to address the problem publicly, as the company already notes that is looking into the matter. On the bright side, the Pixel manufacturer started to get feedback from the Pixel user community and is working on a fix. Bluetooth Music Users are observing that some of the devices that can connect to their cars via Bluetooth maintain the link while playing music, but as soon as a call comes in, the connection bombs. Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P Bluetooth Problem It may be that the problem lies within the software more than the hardware. The reason for this is that handsets that are running on Nougat, such as the Nexus phones, are facing the same problems that have been plaguing the Pixel and Pixel XL. In the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P, Google rolled out the Android 7.1 Nougat developer preview earlier in October. Google did not specify whether the 5X or the 6P are facing the problem, but chances are that it is both. Here is a helpful guide to fixing other common Nexus 6P issues. Conclusion Those who cannot seem to connect their Android 7.1 Nougat-running phones to the car's Bluetooth system have to muster some patience. Google is putting the pedal to the metal to find what is causing the issues and promised to deliver a fix as soon as possible. Until then, Pixel and Nexus owners might have to rely on their handsets' speakers for loud music while driving.

The hackers sent John Podesta an official-looking email on Saturday, March 19, that appeared to come from Google. It warned that someone in Ukraine had obtained Podesta's personal Gmail password and tried unsuccessfully to log in, and it directed him to a website where he should "change your password immediately." Podesta's chief of staff, Sara Latham, forwarded the email to the operations help desk of Clinton's campaign, where staffer Charles Delavan in Brooklyn, New York, wrote back 25 minutes later: "This is a legitimate email. John needs to change his password immediately." But the email was not authentic. The link to the website where Podesta was encouraged to change his Gmail password actually directed him instead to a computer in the Netherlands with a web address associated with Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand located in the South Pacific. The hackers carefully disguised the link using a service that shortens lengthy online addresses. But even for anyone checking more diligently, the address - "google.com-securitysettingpage" - was crafted to appear genuine. In the email, the hackers even provided an internet address of the purported Ukrainian hacker that actually traced to a mobile communications provider in Ukraine. It was also notable that the hackers struck Podesta on a weekend morning, when organizations typically have fewer resources to investigate and respond to reports of such problems. Delavan, the campaign help-desk staffer, did not respond immediately to The Associated Press' questions about his actions that day. It is not immediately clear how Podesta responded to the threat, but five months later hackers successfully downloaded tens of thousands of emails from Podesta's accounts that have now been posted online. The Clinton campaign declined to discuss the incident. Podesta has previously confirmed his emails were hacked and said the FBI was investigating. The suspicious email was among more than 1,400 messages published by WikiLeaks on Friday that had been hacked from Podesta's account. It was not known whether the hackers deliberately left behind the evidence of their attempted break-in for WikiLeaks to reveal, but the tools they were using seven months ago still indicate they were personally targeting Podesta: Late Friday, the computer in the Netherlands that had been used in the hacking attempt featured a copy of Podesta's biographical page from Wikipedia. The U.S Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Homeland Security Department have formally accused Russian state-sponsored hackers for the recent string of cyberattacks intended to influence the presidential election. The help-desk staffer, Delevan, emailed to Podesta's chief of staff a separate, authentic link to reset Podesta's Gmail password and encouraged Podesta to turn on two-factor authentication. That feature protects an account by requiring a second code that is separately sent to a cell phone or alternate email address before a user can log in. "It is absolutely imperative that this is done ASAP," Delevan said. Tod Beardsley, a security research manager at the Boston-based cybersecurity firm Rapid7, said the fact that an IT person deemed the suspicious email to be legitimate "pretty much guarantees the user who is not an IT person is going to click on it." Other emails previously released by WikiLeaks have included messages containing the password for Podesta's iPhone and iPad accounts.

Home > News By Company > Future Market Insights Tweet   How IoT will Usher in a New Era of Smart Mining However, the next big thing would not be big enough, if we invest in smart applications of it. Apart from taking technology to another level, IoT has resolved major problems owing to it applications in various sectors including the mining sector.   (EMAILWIRE.COM, October 29, 2016 ) Magic beans are spilled all over Google, while many pick them up for benefit, most of us pepper the search bar reflecting the curiosity about Internet of Things as the next big thing transforming our world along with technology. Todays impatient world has crowned Google as the cyber ruler owing to its fast solutions spilling techniques, as they account for Googles golden treasure of mined data. However, Internet of Things (IoT) is giving more than just a sustaining competition to Google. Magic spells of IoT have touched many aspects of the Industrial development in many parameters, without sparing the mining sector. Stepping back to history, communication of two devices without using internet was a moment of magic for many, however we live that magic everyday presently. Without the equipment of broadband for connection, we can use air conditioners and television sets using remotes. This is the magic spell of Internet of Things. However, the next big thing would not be big enough, if we invest in smart applications of it. Apart from taking technology to another level, IoT has resolved major problems owing to it applications in various sectors including the mining sector. Looking for insights to decode the future of mining sector? Download a free sample of Global Smart Mining Market. Mining sector has majorly contributed to our economy and embedding its operations with applications of IoT has unveiled a new technological concept, the smart and connected technology. Mining sector is spell bound by the Smart technology owing to its applications in related operations and resolving problems in every parameter. Smart technology enables self-monitoring, analyzing and reporting technology embedded in computer systems, hard disk drives and solid states drives. These enable the system to detect and report to operators regarding various indicators and the degree of reliability along with the intent of reporting about any possibility of hardware failures expected from these devices. Technology of the next big thing has contributed to the mining sector in a significant manner, taking its operations and productivity to another level. IoT has enabled many heavy devices used in the mining field leveraged improved performance through multi-tasking capabilities in fraction of seconds. Equipping these devices with features to connect, communicate, retrieve and send all the mined data to operators and workers effortlessly with the help of proximity sensor, it has slashed the work load to a great extent. Applications of IoT have equipped machines with a feature that enables them to locate data and retrieve it. Many times heavy machines or devices are required to undergo shafts and tunnels to during the mining process, which is a life-risking task. IoT has catered to this risk by enabling machines to machine connection, similar to connection of airplanes to airbases. The technology enables mining data, which can be monitored on screens by operators to ensure devices are on the right track. This technology has accessorized devices and machines with proximity-sensors that enable them to sense where exactly is the data located, while mining under tunnels, shafts, seas, rivers, rails and other such places. Much has been predicted for this technology in the future, as it is expected to log Google out owing to fast paced applications of IoT. It is expected to be ubiquitous in future as compared to Google today. Furthermore, Internet of Things not only senses proximity of data, but also transmits mined data post mining operations, which further help in taking right business decisions in the mining sector. This technology is a great boon to the human kind as mining mainly called for human contribution previously. Operations in the mining field by workers resulted in a catastrophe due to unhealthy working environment, use of unpredicted machines, which were out of the controls of owners and operators. The emerging technology of the Internet of Things has gifted the workers engaged in mining with a life-saving technology. Applications of this technology has equipped the mining fields with On-demand Ventilators, which ensure safe working environment of the mine worker with less possibility of risking of their lives. The spell bound smart technology is changing procedures of mining in every parameter making work of operators effortless and convenient in parallel to engaging in unpredictable guesswork. Connection of machines without internet connections has changed the basis of operations in this sector. Built on cloud computing and networks of data gathering sensors, owners, workers or operators in this field no more need to click on Google to ask for services, all it needs is the smart machine to machine (M2M) connection, which creates an intersection of data and leverage it. This leveraged data is used by Cloud-based applications that help in making decisions related to the mined data. Operations of Internet of Things are based on Cloud computing techniques, which create an intersection of data and enable them to be used by various sensors without using internet. This is how major devices function beyond our knowledge and expectations. So keep these magical beans as they are surely bound to develop into a tree in the near future.

Alphabet was formed last year, in part, to insulate the lucrative online advertising business of its Google division from riskier, more capital-intensive projects now called Other Bets. The strategy was on display in the company's third-quarter results, released on Thursday. The technology giant culled investment in Other Bets and doubled down on Google's cloud and artificial-intelligence initiatives. Those investments will only accelerate next year, executives told analysts during a conference call that followed a strong third-quarter report, driven largely by growth in Google's main digital ad business. The shares rose 1.1 percent to $825.98 at 9:44 a.m. in New York Friday. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said the cloud business is building a team focused on machine learning, an important branch of AI, and is hiring aggressively. "As we head into 2017," he said on the earnings call, "I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and growth." Google is racing against Amazon.com, Microsoft and other big technology companies to provide AI-powered services over the internet from remote data centers. The combination of these technologies may produce powerful and lucrative new products for consumers and business customers. Google doesn't disclose the performance of its cloud business. But its "other revenue" line, which includes this unit along with the Google app store and hardware sales, saw revenue grow 39 percent to $2.4 billion in the third quarter. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the cloud division is "generating substantial revenue growth." Cloud chief Diane Greene has helped win new corporate customers for its data-processing, analysis and storage services this year. Google is still behind market leader Amazon.com, which posted a 55 percent gain in cloud revenue on Thursday, reaching $3.2 billion for the third quarter. However, Google executives' rhetoric suggests Alphabet is plowing money into businesses capable of generating strong returns, and cutting investment from projects with more questionable financial potential. Porat also cautioned investors that marketing spending will rise in the fourth quarter to promote new Google hardware like its Pixel smartphones. Pichai and Porat have told investors before that Alphabet's biggest bets are inside Google. Pichai oversees most of the company's AI and virtual reality efforts, along with its costly data centers. Yet shout-outs for the cloud business came amid a pullback from Alphabet's Other Bets, particularly its Google Fiber internet service and Nest connected-device subsidiary. Other Bets Trimmed The Other Bets segment, which also includes the autonomous vehicle project and two biotech research initiatives, lost $865 million in the third quarter, narrowing from a $980 million loss a year ago. Growth in capital expenditures on these businesses also slowed down from the prior two quarters. Porat stressed that Other Bets are on a "longer time horizon," but also said Alphabet is resetting some of them as they strive to find business models. Earlier in the week, the Fiber internet service announced a retreat from eight major proposed markets as well as jobs cuts and the loss of its top executive. That followed a string of high-level departures from Other Bets companies. "News that Fiber has been 'paused' should be welcomed by investors concerned over rising CapEx," Daniel Salmon, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to investors. Porat said Fiber had made "important breakthroughs" in wireless technology, but is re-evaluating expansion plans. "We wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we re-accelerate deployment," she said. » Next page...

(Image: Reuters) About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc's Google, which crashed Apple Inc's ; smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google’s Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Corp’s; Cortana. “We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information,” Rakowski said in an interview. LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colourful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button.” The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words “OK Google.” By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google “doesn’t have to do negotiations with another handset maker – they can make it as tight as they want,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. “If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. “They will be relegated to just pushing hardware.” Google is coy about its plans. “Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible,” Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. “The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience,” he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it’s not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie,” he said. “I approach this the same way.” Google Google Assistant Samsung Siri Trending Articles Arunachal Press Condemns Killing of Dainik Bhaskar Journalist Dharmendra Singh in Bihar Bigg Boss 10, Day 27: Salman Khan Questions Rahul, Rohan and Karan's Lethargic Attitudes Supreme Court Issues Notice to Salman Khan in Chinkara Poaching Case Chinkara Case: SC Admits Rajasthan's Plea Against Salman Khan Trending Articles Arunachal Press Condemns Killing of Dainik Bhaskar Journalist Dharmendra Singh in Bihar Bigg Boss 10, Day 27: Salman Khan Questions Rahul, Rohan and Karan's Lethargic Attitudes Supreme Court Issues Notice to Salman Khan in Chinkara Poaching Case Chinkara Case: SC Admits Rajasthan's Plea Against Salman Khan 'Whole' BJP is Against Demonetisation, Alleges Arvind Kejriwal 'You See More Liberal Opinion from RSS Because Educated Middle-Class is Fuelling its Growthâ Modi Armour: Crackdown on Benami Property & Mega Rural Package Coming RBI Directs Banks to Waive ATM Charges on All Transactions From Our Network Modi in Ghazipur: PM's rally is to convince people that demonetisation is a good decision- FirstPost Naxal-hit village in Latehar gets electricity for the first time - Pradesh18 Thousands throng gurdwaras to mark Gurpurab - Pradesh18 About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News 'Whole' BJP is Against Demonetisation, Alleges Arvind Kejriwal Australia vs South Africa Live Score: 2nd Test, Day 4 at Hobart 15 Dead in Iraq Suicide Bombings Claimed by Islamic State Syria Conflict: Scores of Pakistani, Afghan and Iranian Fighters killed in Aleppo Watch: India@9 With Zakka Jacob & Bhupendra Chaubey Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Boosts Buybacks After Another Great Quarter With a strong ad business and promising progress in "Other Bets," the internet search giant is repurchasing (exactly) $7,019,340,976.83 in shares. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Oct 28, 2016 at 6:42PM IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced stronger-than-expected third-quarter 2016 results Thursday after the market close, marking its fourth report since shifting to a segment-based reporting model earlier this year. With Alphabet stock up 1% as of this writing after briefly touching a fresh all-time high, it's apparent the market is happy with what it had to say.  Let's take a closer look at how Alphabet kicked off the second half of the year. The headline numbers Consolidated quarterly revenue increased 20.2% year over year, to $22.45 billion, and would have increased 23% if it weren't for the effects of continued foreign-currency pressure. Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), consolidated operating income grew 22.5% year over year, to $5.77 billion, and net income rose 27.2%, to $5.06 billion. GAAP net income per share also increased 26.5%, to $7.25, for each of Alphabet's class A and B common shares and class C capital stock. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation, operating income grew 24.2% year over year, to $7.63 billion, and net income rose 24%, to $6.33 billion. Adjusted net income per share grew 23.3% year over year, to $9.06. Keeping in mind that last quarter, Alphabet completed all share repurchases under its previous repurchase authorization, its board of directors also authorized a new repurchase program of up to $7,019,340,976.83 shares. As an aside, Alphabet could have made its latest repurchase authorization an even $7 billion, but it would have sacrificed an opportunity to make another very Google-esque joke. Astute math geeks quickly figured out that 7019.34097683 is equivalent to 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) to the power of "e," an important mathematical constant. And this replaces Google's previous authorization, which allowed repurchases of up to $5,099,019,513.59 -- which is the square root of 26 multiplied by $1 billion. Getting back to the headline numbers, Google doesn't provide specific quarterly financial guidance. So for perspective -- and while we don't typically pay close attention to Wall Street's expectations -- analysts had predicted Google would report lower revenue of $18 billion and adjusted earnings of only $8.64 per share. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat called it a "great third quarter" adding, "Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we're excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets." Breaking it down Alphabet once again offered color on its two primary operating segments, including Google and Other Bets.   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Growth (YOY) Google segment revenues $18.534 billion $22.254 billion 20.1% Google operating income $5.807 billion $6.778 billion 16.7% Other Bets revenues $141 million $197 million 39.7% Other Bets operating income (loss) ($980 million) ($865 million) N/A DATA SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. On Other Bets During the subsequent conference call, Porat was quick to offer the caveat that, "[W]e think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer-term horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy [...]." After all, as I pointed out in my earnings preview earlier this week, the Other Bets segment consists primarily of early-stage, pre-revenue businesses that operate in a variety of different industries. The majority of Other Bets' $197 million in revenue -- an increase of nearly 40% over the same year-ago period -- was generated as per usual by Nest (connected home products), Fiber (high-speed internet), and Verily (longevity solutions). And the segment remains consistently unprofitable, generating an operating loss this quarter of $865 million. To Alphabet's credit, Other Bets' operating loss, excluding stock-based compensation (SBC), would have been "just" $665 million. And even accounting for SBC, this quarter's loss narrowed significantly from $980 million in the same year-ago period, even as capital expenditures dedicated to the segment rose 19.6% year over year, to $324 million, mostly reflecting continuing investments in the Fiber business. Finally, Other Bets' capital expenditures remain a small fraction of the $2.43 billion the company dedicated to its core Google business.  Speaking of which... As a reminder, Google's segment businesses include Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play, and Gmail, as well as Ads, Commerce, Apps, Cloud, and hardware products. But as expected, the main driver of revenue for most of Google's segments remains advertising. Thankfully, that core revenue source continued to enjoy robust growth. Advertising revenue at Google increased 18.1% year over year, to $19.82 billion, representing 88.3% of Alphabet's total revenue, and down slightly from just over 89% last quarter. Within that, advertising revenue from Google's own websites grew 22.9%, to $16.09 billion, and ad revenue from Google Network Members' sites rose 1%, to $3.732 billion. During the call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's advertising business is "thriving in a mobile world," thanks largely to its simple, resonating value proposition to marketers as enabled by Google's suite of vastly popular mobile properties from Search to YouTube, Maps, and Google Play.  "They are using our services because they want to actively watch something they are passionate about, or because they want to know, go, do, or buy something," added Pichai. "It's just like people used to be glued to their TV screen during prime time -- our services are prime time for the mobile world." Growth in aggregate paid clicks accelerated to 33% year over year this quarter -- up from 29% last quarter -- including 42% growth in paid clicks on Google websites, and a 1% increase in paid clicks on Google Network Members' sites. On the other hand, aggregate cost-per-click -- which helps quantify how much Google makes per ad -- declined 11% year over year, including a 13% drop on Google sites, and a 14% decline on Google Network Members' sites. This includes a rapid increase in YouTube's TrueView impressions, which tend to reach consumers earlier in the purchase funnel, so generally monetize at lower rates than traditional web-based ads. Even so, Google is working to make this up in volume. In addition to YouTube's inherent growth, the company recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase online awareness of their brands. And early tests indicate that YouTube generates nearly twice as many Google and YouTube searches for their brands than comparable TV impressions. Last but not least, we can't forget revenue from Google's non-advertising sources. Thanks to strong performances from both Google Play and Cloud, "Other" Google revenue grew 38.8% year over year, to $2.43 billion. There were no big positive or negative surprises in this report. It's important, however, that the company's core ad business stays healthy, and that it continues to methodically invest in promising complementary growth opportunities. More than anything, this represents the latest in a string of strong reports from Alphabet. All things considered, it's no surprise to see shares hovering near all-time highs right now.

Just this week, T-Mobile announced that they will be giving $325 bill credits to individuals who buy the Pixel and bring it to their network. And even without this announcement, sales of the two devices have been soaring high in the past weeks. This is likely because the two devices have been said to exceed the expectations of Google. But because of the demand for the two smartphones, there are some customers who are currently waiting for their Pixel device to be delivered. Some of these individuals may even have to wait up to 4 weeks for their new smartphone to be shipped to them. Thankfully, Google has a way to ease out the wait as they are encouraging themselves to get the orders delivered on time. Customers who are faced with a delayed shipping date are being offered a $50 credit by Google, in the event that delivery of the Pixel devices are missed. It's important to note, however, that Google has not yet officially announced this news. But a number of users have confirmed receiving the email from Google, which confirms their ordered unit has already been placed under a shipping status. The email also tells them they will be given a $50 Google Play Store credit as compensation for the wait. If you're among those that have recently ordered a Pixel or Pixel XL but are told to wait for shipping, you may want to check your email for the message from Google.     Source:  Android Headlines 9to5Google Google Google Pixel XL Google Pixel Google Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Products mentioned Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Previous ArticleHow would you change Google's Pixel phones?

But what would happen if we allowed artificial intelligence to create its own encryption strategy?  ( Chis Jackson | Getty Images ) Advertisement The machines are getting smarter folks, as they are now at a point where they can keep secrets from us. A team from Google Brain that is part of the company's deep learning project worked on artificial intelligence capable of protecting messages from prying eyes. What we have here is human-independent AI performing an encryption task that makes it difficult for us to crack. Just imagine computers encrypting our messages and data by their lonesome, and we can't have access to it. That's what Google is working on, and the company has experienced some success thus far. Google employees Martín Abadi and David G. Andersen are the men behind this exciting project. They created three test subjects - all neural networks - known only as Alice, Bob and Eve. The task is to have them pass notes to each other that are encrypted to a point where humans are unable to gain access. According to a report from New Scientist, Abadi and Andersen assigned tasks to each AI. Alice needed to send a message that only Bob can decipher and read, while Eve is tasked with how to decode the message. Not an easy task, even for an AI, because at first both Alice and Bob were terrible at hiding their secrets, but things got better over time. "We ask whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect information from other neural networks. Specifically, we focus on ensuring confidentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we specify those properties in terms of an adversary," wrote Abadi and Andersen. "Thus, a system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob." AIs Becoming Smarter Alice was able to create her own encryption, and Bob managed to figure out how to decrypt it. This was all achieved after more than 15,000 tries. It reached a point where Bob could decrypt Alice's text messages back into normal plain text, and Eve could only figure out eight of the 16 bits that form the message. Here's something rather interesting. You see, researchers have no idea how the encryption works. Machine learning can provide the solution without much fuss, but when it comes down to understanding the whole thing, that's when problem arises. Also, one cannot guarantee security would be tight if these practices are used in the real world, so as it stands, AI is not yet ready to create encryptions from scratch, but that day will come as they learn. Google Brain is pretty awesome, for because of it, the Google Translate feature has gotten a huge boost in accuracy.

A trove of emails released by anti-secrecy site WikiLeaks Friday suggests that Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta received an email on March 19 that appeared to come from a Google tech support account. The email told him that somebody had attempted to sign on to his Gmail account in Ukraine and that he needed to change his password "immediately." Podesta forwarded the email to his chief of staff, Sara Latham, who in turn forwarded it to the Clinton campaign operations help desk for assistance. Brooklyn-based tech staffer Charles Delavan picked up the request. "This is a legitimate email. John needs to change his password immediately," Delavan responded. "It is absolutely imperative that this is done ASAP."

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Latham forwarded Delavan's response to another staffer, Milia Fisher, who was asked to call Podesta and guide him through the password reset process. Turns out the "change your password" request was anything but "legitimate." The initial email from what appeared to be a Google account asked Podesta to follow a link to a website where he could reset his password. But rather than taking him to an actual Google site, the link took Podesta to a web address hooked up to a computer in the Netherlands, the Associated Press reported. Clinton campaign tech staffer Charles Delavan told Podesta the email was "legitimate." (Facebook) The Clinton campaign declined to comment on whether Podesta actually clicked the link, but the email correspondence suggests he did. Five months after the correspondence outlined in Friday's leak, hackers successfully downloaded more than 50,000 emails from Podesta's accounts and subsequently released them to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks dump: Clinton aides panicked after private server news Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin told the Daily News Friday that the campaign is not authenticating any emails released by WikiLeaks, and blasted GOP nominee Donald Trump for denying the U.S. State Department's conclusion that the embarrassing hack into Podesta's email servers could only have been ordered by senior Russian government officials. "The nominee of what was once the party of Reagan is taking Putin's denial of the hacking over the clear conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community," Caplin said. "We know that Trump won't stand up to Putin but it's bizarre that Republican leaders won't stand up to Trump on this national security issue." The WikiLeaks dumps have caused frequent headaches for the Clinton campaign. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) WikiLeaks has released roughly 35,000 Clinton campaign emails since August, causing frequent and embarassing disruptions for the Democratic nominee.   The hacked email correspondence about Podesta's password was among more than 1,400 messages published by WikiLeaks on Friday, and comes on the same day as the FBI reopened its investigation into Clinton's handling of her private email server after discovering a trove of new emails while investigating disgraced New York politician Anthony Weiner's recent sexting scandal. Weiner's estranged wife is Clinton campaign Vice Chairwoman Huma Abedin. Erica Garner rips Clinton camp over emails on her father's death The FBI would not elaborate on what the newly revealed emails might contain, but said it will review them "to determine whether they contain classified information."

The trend is contributing to an advertising shift away from traditional network television programming to the more eclectic and diversified mix of clips ranging from cute cat videos to sobering shots of street violence found on YouTube. As more advertising dollars flow to YouTube, it's making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report released Thursday, Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 percent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 percent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. All that money is providing Google with more financial firepower to buy the rights to stream cable networks' shows on YouTube, too, something likely to reel in even more viewers. It also is helping to finance Alphabet's investments in far-flung projects ranging from self-driving cars to internet-beaming balloons. That segment, known as "Other Bets," lost $865 million during the July-September period, narrowing from a $980 million setback last year as Alphabet imposed more expense controls. SMART DEAL YouTube already has proven to be one of the best bets that Google has ever made since it bought the video site for $1.76 billion a decade ago. At that juncture, YouTube consisted mostly of crudely made videos shot by amateurs and clips pirated from movie and TV studios that were threatening to sue the site into oblivion. It had built a worldwide audience of about 72 million viewers when Google took control in November 2006. Since then, YouTube has evolved into a far more polished channel that has spawned unlikely stars such as "PewDiePie" (Swedish comedian Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg) while largely making peace with studios by creating an automated screening system that detects pirated content. YouTube says it has paid more than $2 billion to studios that have chosen to leave their material on the site and share in the ad revenue generated by their clips. Meanwhile, YouTube's audience has surpassed 1 billion, with 80 percent of the viewers outside the U.S. YouTube also boasts that its site reaches more people between the ages of 18 and 34 years old - the "millennial" generation - than any cable network. That segment of YouTube's audience is a major reason why more than half its video clips are watched on mobile devices. Google CEO Sundar Pichai likened YouTube to prime-time TV "for the mobile world" in a Thursday conference call that was streamed on YouTube. He told analysts that YouTube "continues to shine" as more major advertisers promote their brands on the site. Alphabet doesn't disclose how much money YouTube is making, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates YouTube's annual revenue has now reached $10 billion and is increasing by as much as 40 percent a year. The growth makes YouTube "one of the strongest assets fundamentally on the internet today," Mahaney wrote in a research note earlier this week. STILL LACKING Despite its progress, YouTube has been slow in realizing its full potential, leaving it vulnerable to new challengers for viewer's attention, such as Facebook's Live video feature, says Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson. The problem, as Olson sees it, is that YouTube has had trouble persuading TV and movie studios to license more of their content on their site, something that that might have made YouTube as dominant in video as Google is in search. But YouTube could be on a major breakthrough, according to a report published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal. Citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Google had reached an agreement with CBS to include its network in a cable-like service called "Unplugged" that will debut on YouTube next year. Google is also negotiating for the rights to the Fox network, ESPN and NBC, among others, the Journal said. Google cited YouTube licensing rights as one of the reasons that its costs to generate revenue, excluding ad commissions, rose by $1 billion, or 30 percent, from last year. "The dam appears to be finally cracking" for even better content to come to YouTube, Olson said. © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Chainfire achieves systemless root access to Pixel, available to the public soon By John Hoff - October 28, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Getting root access has become a more complicated thing ever since Google tightened up on the security and file integrity protocols of Android starting with Marshmallow, and now into Android Nougat. Developers have had to become more creative in gaining root, but that is not stopping the legendary Chainfire. He has tweeted that he has gained root access to the Google Pixel which runs on Android 7.1 Nougat, and that an updated SuperSU should be published soon. Chainfire first tweeted this: The developer tweeted a follow-up, saying that “automating, cleanup, packaging etc could take a few days.” If you’re still a bit hazy on what just happened, it means that root access to the Google Pixel has been gained without compromising the file integrity of system files. That is an achievement in itself, given how Android 7.1 Nougat has been built. Here’s a photo from Chainfire, just for posterity. It should only be a few days or a week or so before we see the official SuperSU app come out for systemless root on the Google Pixel. Once again, we will just need to wait until Chainfire finally delivers the goods.

Now we have actually managed to enable these themes on a rooted device and we’ve screenshotted them for you to check out before the app actually gets them… If you have the latest version of Allo, you may have noticed that Google added a “Monochrome” theme option in the “General settings” menu. That option doesn’t make sense in the current version, because the monochrome mode isn’t really all that much different than the mostly-monochrome default theme. But that’s about to change, because you’re soon going to be able to pick from a variety of colorful themes for each of your chats. As you can see below, these match up pretty well with the many theme names we discovered the other day. They range from “Moon” to “Sorbet” to “Clouds”. Please ignore my terribly hideous Allo selfie. It seems that the app is going to suggest that you pick a theme every time you start a new conversation, and then you’ll be able to change it at any time from the same menu that houses other chat details like notifications and seeing a gallery of shared media. Here’s what the theme picker and the chat settings menus look like: The Google Allo 2.0 update is a pretty substantial one, but this is one of those features that look to be waiting for a Google server-side switch. Other than this, Allo 2.0 has app shortcuts that let you create a conversation by tapping and holding the icon from the home screen, Quick Reply for replying from an Allo notification, multi-window mode for using the app alongside another one in Android Nougat, and a new accessibility mode. We still don’t know when chat themes will roll out in Allo, but stay tuned as we learn more. So it seems monochrome in Allo 2 doesn’t serve much purpose yet, but you’re going to want to have that option when chat themes are added. — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) October 26, 2016 Guides Apps and Updates View THe Guide Google View THe Guide Google Allo View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Is this the email that hacked John Podesta’s account? Posted on Friday, October 28, 2016 by CNN in Election A phishing email sent to Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta may have been so sophisticated that it fooled the campaign’s own IT staffers, who at one point advised him it was a legitimate warning to change his password. The stolen email thread, released by WikiLeaks Friday, also provides the most direct evidence yet that the Russian government was behind the damaging hack into the Clinton campaign, according to a private cybersecurity company. The thread shows a Clinton campaign staffer writing that a phishing email sent to Podesta’s Gmail account on March 19, 2016, is “legitimate,” though the staffer advises him to go through Google’s official procedures to update his password. It’s not clear if Podesta gave hackers his password before he was advised by his staff, or if the email in question was the one that led to the hack. The Clinton campaign has not commented directly on the hacked emails and CNN cannot independently verify their authenticity. On its face, the source of the potentially dangerous email is Google, but a closer look at the actual mailing address shows an unfamiliar or bogus-looking account: “no-reply@accounts.googlemail.com.” The subject line warns, “Someone has your password” and the body of the message says “someone” in Ukraine tried, but was stopped, from signing into Podesta’s account. “You should change your password immediately,” the email warns. The words “CHANGE PASSWORD” then appear — inviting Podesta to click on them — as a way to do just that. But the address did not link to a secure Google web page, instead directing the user blindly via bit.ly, a service used to shorten or conceal web addresses. According to the cybersercurity company SecureWorks, the link used in the Podesta email was clicked two times. If his information was entered into a form on the landing site — potentially run by a hacker — the floodgates could have opened right there. Podesta was not the only Clinton campaign staffer targeted, SecureWorks found. “We saw 108 email addresses targeted and we know that 20 of the links that were sent to those individuals were clicked,” Phil Burdette, a senior security researcher at the firm, told CNN on Friday. There were 213 similar bit.ly links created, he said, but because there were duplicates it is likely the same accounts received multiple phishing messages. It is unclear if anyone else targeted entered their information. The Russian connection The US government has pinned other cyberattacks targeting Democratic groups — including the summer’s hack of the Democratic National Committee — on the Russian government, though it has not yet accused Moscow of the Podesta hack. Moscow has denied involvement. SecureWorks, however, says Friday’s email thread provides proof of Russia’s involvement in the Podesta hack. The group points to evidence that “Fancy Bear” — the name of the cyberespionage group also believed to have carried out the allegedly Russia-led DNC hacks — was involved in the Podesta thefts. “Fancy Bear” is a nickname for one of the Russian military-intelligence hacking groups that were discovered in the DNC’s servers. Other cyberfirms have corroborated these findings, as has the US government. SecureWorks has linked the bit.ly account used in the Podesta phishing attack to “Fancy Bear.” WikiLeaks has denied working with the Russians, though the group won’t reveal its sources for the material it releases. Don Smith, the director of cyberintelligence at SecureWorks, said historically, the targeting of the bit.ly campaign appears aimed at military attaches in Western embassies, in addition to dissidents in Ukraine and Georgia and journalists outside Russia. But the phishing operation retrained its focus in March 2016, he said, employing the same tactics in an effort to breach the DNC and Clinton campaign staff email. “You don’t have to think very hard to determine it was one of the Russian intelligence agencies,” Smith said.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33.

I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own.

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. It is time to talk to the playmaker all the fame wide receiver Michael Irvin now an analyst with the NFL network Michael Irvin brought to you by Shaw's joins us now on the AT&T hotline hello Michael how are you. And I don't look guys are you guys. I read Michael. Let's let me ask you would opinion we were just discussing this do you think Rex Ryan is a good head football coach in the NFL. So great courses I didn't think replied it's a good approach and have football coach. I think Britain appealed there now what I don't would be you know being with immediately there. Because all greet these as a coordinator got aren't that right up there at the mine the gold with him and Rick. I don't think it spiral that lies offensive mind. To go week you're out late but I think he's found them now and then the nit and the lives have been gore won a problem he's gone I think. Run played a two run plays better if you meet unique blocking skiing still there. You're not prepared for and everything sort that there. And it take its loan that was an artist is a great cooker. It divider guy. You know these are you in the top all the time. You know up with Google boulder you know what are you in the hunt for work that's what I considered great. Now he's got a wonderful drugmaker gained really interesting bit of pain and even get beat that goal. But I think finally now he's found an opposite coordinated event it is style. Before I ask you a football question I got I got to know what so what perhaps. Let's double perhaps on TV this week gut tell me tell me the hat stories you're you're you're rocket. We're. We're over by Lugo say editor at bats are counted in the round table you know we're all we're bull rumored. We're over my guys ordered him over here in new York and everything they are there there are it's got to live in New York. Pretty developed any brought bet that in to work again and I've been brought there. Whatever it reapply dollop of first time diamond goblet dying as one day in court. So you don't have it kind of got relegated to court today it could throw what I won't be here is thought it. Just slightly. You know what who hit it goes digital overdid it would award one right now we're Abu. Older restore if I'm aware Federer. You'll see. Her work a computer as to exactly what I would do that I know you look at it like a huge OP. You do to your Google can outweigh. Walk in the realm of good black out that Google could commit pedal. It would raise about they go up which is we'll see. So what can outlook what do you do let's I'm gonna make you the the coach of the cowboys. Right now but at least now for the rest of this interview here the coach of the cowboys got Tony Romo available in the got. Dax got so what what do you do when your quarterback. All maps mania. What roll. It is that there would not sit all alone does was of all is that it was totally rule jobs within that it. You stop being a team in and out see you just beat Green Bay in combat you'd be. Well the Philadelphia creep ever so I know multiples that you beat barely be through certain topic du. But but we extrapolate. Because we have to try to misery as we're running toward. So you beat Philadelphia. It becomes or put me now to go back to Tony Romo in this situation. Because you do beat the top team in the industry. You are the clear favorite to go meet and we drink industry folk agree article. In that area in an apartment group favorite I don't think there. There's a great article written by Richard Sherman and the players Tribune and and part of the key rips the NFL for. Bungle in the Josh brown that situation so bad but mostly takes him to task. Or would be an obsessed with celebrations. In and thrown penalties and and fining guys for this what's your take on. We are the league is when it comes the legislating these these touchdown celebrations. Are. I'm on with them or on some sort that out so flat out war do you perhaps aren't. And then in initial personality you're you know was it it's not about Abbott robot what makes it's beautiful when that chip in to take it all these different people. And getting him on playing pretty soon years of this from personalities and different people and I wanna I wanna Eagles personality. And I wanna see the different people but I do I do want us to continue to look out for the safety. In net you know making sure that those fearing an all over the appropriate people and here. That there's an enormous side of caution when it comes to those things. But but this is the celebration stuff purchase its main that's. But that's a little off all the miners and. We're talking to Michael Irvin of the NFL network and and as we look at an excuse me as we look at the games going on. Up for this coming weekend and we look at the gap that seems to be growing between the patriots in the rest of the AFC. The question is if the patriots get to Houston in February what's the NFC team most likely that they'll be facing. And that's what that that's what or import right now we're doubts belt right now. We last week we were saying it would mama's so Minnesota looked good but I RR RR figure when you watch that game and a social Adobe used a way to. Minnesota border need one more act there. AA could the defense that they have been happening cabinet it would mean by that is you got me a good running game. Oh you have to be able to show me a lot of good pad Wednesday. Are so mean good spent between you Gordon eat one more accurate. To get bigger and that's what Philadelphia beat them that now ballot. Allah and the record we have a great running game is in there Rick Scott who. In the passing game I'm not turning the ball low. Those two are. We would with the wood which went up could be could be better makes the outlook express nepalese origin. Look at that sunrise. Pickle boat with too broad talking. In the NFC as expressed app that will make doubt suspect that they would be. Autopilot up I think you're talking in the end up regardless that is to go I heard of it by. I didn't act on that right. You're also. Send an I game yet which what was that. Okay Edison this digs there I was up yet it probably a fun game to play a tough game to watch wolf. That's what could this mean. I want you loved watching. All of bear tell me why me why you like them. Ulbrich hurt it was it was a it was up about what we owe. I mean I'm echo the beavers were different but it was so one quarter crack for. I'll look at shall there that we in that game at a car I want to see outlook. What went Super Bowl our collective we went looking and have a collective. Our collective we went out. You're goes there we. And in fact that's what at what I wondered if he won't which. We got a couple two of collusion on these gains after weak opening portrait of the victims from the Beck reported are gonna work out out. You would get if you don't do anything there that aren't ya for the third. You know what that. On appropriate now but it's got Arnold that we are thwarted dark rich it will act like that it but I will go through puberty it could be permanent actors. Or who we regard it. But I outlaw the battle of the old wheels man that was. Great fight at all are all getting. I think we're gonna have an outgrow. I like about our collective wheels of the scores 28 to 44. Army 66 every yeah it does not something you think about it. And I eat your popcorn Amanda is I do not watch in this 66 game and kickers. Michael you know. You'll probably would have record record that go to where did you go. Home don't hurt no better than a lot of retired rear view. I don't look you know we're right through your. Old guards who pick the sale fall series got technical about it you've got to hit them all up right. Outlet while and a that gave me edit that that would Korea and unloved. You know I would've you would have put the kicker Hewitt but your kicker in the locker if if you if you go out there you go and over the middle. I can't remember the name of that play that that you write that your favorite player from Detroit but anyway hit you right between the gates on that plane that was on. Yeah that's it so. That play all day on getting jobs. And the kicker misses like 25 yarder Hugo Craig. Google credit ordered up I would have to be careful. You know I don't wanna do what what I would do is go to dropped almost all over here that would strongly. Look at their leader. A tickle your agreed to go ball well all I got a bruises you look at it that's why don't you bit. No opener Greg only and that. I'll go up to bed here at the table. Their salt and it but it got well you cores on Tuesday creepy it at the Pentagon that they are monitored compared there. Michael what looked out and about defense the patriots seem to have one of these defense is that had in the past few years where. They'll give up lots yards so make mediocre quarterbacks looked good but then they get stingy and they don't give up points. It frustrates a lot of fans did you play with a defense like that in as an offensive weapon like you were how would you have felt the ball. Plano with that kind of ID. So they don't break that is the current releases. There's going to be it. Every defense is going to be and it is you know talent in the league is too great. It and they're making the rules were offered. Expect that's why we you're. Up. Let where we need to kind of game that we're on Sunday night because. That the league noses you guys once you do what you want to point out and everything what book from being. Me daddy that daddy is great he said don't Biden people. Always be in but we don't break unit there at okay be prevented great B. Everything. Is going to be a huge risk and not great that it would be it's about that's what we we want chips. So many about a school that's when you have that you went to opens this week because they come down to. Other night Pittsburgh you know critical order converted the three point. The report we know you're worried we bit but we did not break that you Bogut seven. We're right back Pittman V so they're you know every now and ultimately the at all. We get older we feel in our fears are wrapped in your wheels that's what I'm talking about. I before we get Johnny here I got to ask this couple weeks go on inside the NFL did you say Erin Rogers was the best quarterback in the game all Michael Irvin. They're if you give me. Where you have to look at one quarterback right now and I don't know where it coats you I don't even aware that the mine running a no Motorola and it was clear that I have. I will take in Iraq. Because they're rock when you put it together most. Physically gifted. Earlier in Iran related role and ability to read regain. And understand the game. Is the best quarterback in the NB it in this situation now. That that is I don't know that the analytical I don't know it's clear that up anywhere yet. I would take care arises in this situation. And quarterback. Michael to roam Europe. The old guy. Oh my goodness you know we can talk next I don't know. To. I. That up but not now about who you're me much good though. Abrupt in what order that. I would say in the can bring your sister Whitfield. There Arctic to operate the worst thing now there's no Biden and max's in his system. And get the most out of a guys around have become break in here and that's in Yemen Iraq when we're talking about Iraq. It's separation all right there we go we we give you some reasonable excuses. Because we figured it was he can't get separation well. If you let your will probably say that from the receiver therefore the Green Bay receivers are better. Recovery is due raises the level of old guys are. With in the system that he plays in the way he played the gates so valued that the caveat you give me my quarterback and I mean he bring to your system. Then on pig normal wherever about it but he made all blow is this for everybody because nobody has mastered run what we do better on those lead. I we can talk to you next we appreciate time as always Michael has been ordered it. There. Thank bags our program that is Michael Irvin from the NFL network.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Davidson & Licht, a Top-Rated Jewelry Store in San Jose, Announces Local Review Milestone Davidson & Licht, a Top-Rated Jewelry Store in San Jose, Announces Local Review Milestone Posted on October 29, 2016 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Davidson & Licht is proud to announce that it has passed four reviews on Google for its San Jose jewelry store. With a forthcoming new website, the company is working hard on expanding its social media outreach to San Jose jewelry lovers. San Jose, California (PRWEB) October 28, 2016 Davidson & Licht, recognized as one of the top-rated jewelry stores in San Jose, is proud to announce a significant review milestone for its reviews on Google's local service. With San Jose consumers increasingly turning to local review sites like Google and Yelp, Davidson & Licht has increased its focus on social media marketing. "With over ninety reviews of our Walnut Creek store and now four for our San Jose jewelry store, as well as 135 combined on Yelp, we're making significant progress towards cementing our position as the Bay Area’s best jewelry store" explained Jason Licht, marketing manager for Davidson and Licht. "With recent innovations such as our new status as an authorized IWC watch dealer and our continuing commitment to the Rolex brand, we are increasingly known as 'the' jewelry store to go to for watches, in addition to our traditional strengths in key brands of jewelry such as Roberto Coin, Marco Bicego, and Hearts on Fire among many others." To read Google reviews of the San Jose jewelry store, visit Davidson and Licht at http://www.davidsonandlicht.com/ and scroll to the bottom of any page. Next click on the Google icons at the bottom next to Santa Clara, and one can then visit the Google listing for that store. Note that the jewelry store serves both San Jose and Santa Clara but is technically in Santa Clara, being located in the prestigious Valley Fair mall. THE BEST REVIEW OF THE SAN JOSE STORE: AN IN-STORE VISIT It's ironic for something as personal and tangible as jewelry that today's consumers are increasingly favoring the Internet. After all, one doesn't wear a digital photograph of a diamond ring or an IWC watch but rather a "real" item of jewelry. Even online review sites such as Google and Yelp, while certainly helpful, showcase the experience of other customers when really there is only one review that matters: that of the individual customer him- or herself. Even more significant, shopping for wedding rings, engagement rings, or high-end watches such as Rolex or IWC can make an enjoyable outing with one's significant other, something that can be a lot more fun and real than browsing pictures online! That said, technologically savvy Bay Area consumers are urged to experience Davidson & Licht online, first, as long as they don't forget that nothing can substitute for an in-store experience. Indeed, interested parties are urged to visit the stores which feature custom watch boutiques such as Rolex in both Walnut Creek and Valley Fair, and IWC in Walnut Creek, to name a few. (IWC watches can be browsed by Bay Area customers at http://www.davidsonandlicht.com/brand/iwc/ prior to an in-store visit). ABOUT DAVIDSON & LICHT JEWELERS Davidson & Licht (http://www.davidsonandlicht.com/) is one of the San Francisco Bay Area's top jewelers, with jewelry stores in Walnut Creek and in Santa Clara / San Jose in the Valley Fair mall. With a storied history, the company boasts the Bay Area's finest selection of engagement rings, wedding bands, and other fine jewelry for weddings and anniversaries. Besides carrying the best jewelry designers from Marco Bicego to Hearts on Fire, Mikimoto to Robert Coin and everything in between, the company also offers in-house Rolex watch repair.

Apparently this was because demand for the new phones had exceeded Google’s expectations, which is actually a pretty good problem to have, and because of that some orders are going out a bit later than expected. So much so that according to a post on Reddit, some Pixel customers are reporting that they have received emails from Google offering them $50 in Play Store credit to help make up for the delay in shipping. The email reads, “Thank you for your recent purchase on Google Store.

Now Page, chief executive officer of Google parent Alphabet Inc, has recruited the same person to helm the Google fiber unit. Jonathan Rosenberg, a longtime Google product executive who advises Page, was recently appointed as a counsellor to Alphabet’s Access unit, which oversees the fiber broadband operations, according to two people familiar with the decision. That comes after Access chief executive officer Craig Barratt stepped down earlier this week. Rosenberg’s assignment suggests another move by Alphabet to impose fiscal discipline and improve corporate governance at Other Bets businesses like fiber and Nest. An Alphabet spokeswoman declined to comment. Barratt announced his departure at an all-hands Access meeting on Tuesday. Simultaneously, Google fiber said it was pulling back fiber-to-the-home expansion plans in eight major urban markets and shedding nine per cent of its staff. Alphabet said a trio of fiber executives would run the division temporarily, but did not appoint a direct replacement for Barratt. Page’s fixer The role of troubleshooter is not new to Rosenberg, a widely respected figure at Google. For years, he served as the top product executive during Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt’s tenure as Google CEO, managing successful offerings in advertising, search and Android. In 2014, he led the operating committee at Motorola Mobility as Google prepared to sell the phone maker to Lenovo Group Ltd. Rosenberg also has broadband experience. Before joining Google in 2002, Rosenberg ran product and services for Excite@Home, an early — albeit troubled — high-speed internet service provider. His stint at Google’s robotics unit, called Replicant internally, was less about expansion than trimming. Andy Rubin, the former chief of Android, led an acquisition spree in 2013 that brought in roughly 300 robotics engineers. Rubin unexpectedly left a year later and Rosenberg took over some time in 2015. Last November, Rosenberg ran a meeting that raised concern about spending at one of the company’s largest robotics businesses, Boston Dynamics, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Soon after, Google tried to sell Boston Dynamics, although a deal has yet to materialize. In January, Alphabet hired Hans Peter Brondmo, a former Nokia executive, to run Replicant, relieving Rosenberg of his interim duties. Fiscal discipline Some investors may be eager to see similar fiscal restraint at Google fiber, which has been the most costly unit outside of the main Google business. On Thursday, Alphabet reported quarterly results that included reduced spending and smaller losses at the Other Bets businesses. “Google appears to finally be reining in costs in Other Bets we believe in large part driven by a rationalization in Access,” Michael Nathanson, analyst at MoffettNathanson, wrote in a Friday research note. On Thursday, Alphabet also deflect concerns about high-level departures at divisions outside of Google. The company has a “deep bench” of senior leadership, an Alphabet executive said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Reuters Video: Reflection ‘healthy’ for Democratic party, says Obama Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Alphabet sales top estimates on ads while spending continues SkyRunner David beats Google Goliath Page to all-terrain vehicle (VIDEO) Google co-founder funding flying car projects, says report (VIDEO) Nest co-founder Fadell flies the coop Why the world is drawing battle lines against US tech giants Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Oct 28, 3:32 PM EDT Correction: Twitter-In Need Of Change story NEW YORK (AP) -- In a story Oct. 27 about changes awaiting Twitter users, The Associated Press misidentified the Twitter user who made comparisons to YouTube. The remarks came from Brant Moeller, CEO of a Brooklyn-based creative agency, rather than New York attorney Danny Mann. A corrected version of the story is below: More changes await Twitter users as service tries to grow Twitter users are bound to see changes as the beleaguered communications service tries to broaden its appeal to more people and advertisers By BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Twitter users are bound to see changes as the beleaguered service favored by journalists, celebrities, politicians and cranks tries to broaden its appeal and attract advertisers. That's whether it gets a new owner or not. On Thursday, Twitter announced one immediate change: It's shutting down its once-pioneering video-sharing app Vine, which has been eclipsed by the likes of Snapchat and Instagram. What else might be in the works? For now, think tons of small tweaks rather than a 180-degree turn. In a conference call discussing the San Francisco-company's quarterly earnings, an analyst asked CEO Jack Dorsey if there were any plans for big, revolutionary product changes. "We've been making hundreds of small changes as quickly as we can," Dorsey's responded, adding that users are showing that the "changes are working." For now, it's looking like Twitter will stay an independent company, despite months of rumors to the contrary. But a new owner could still swoop in, and depending on who it is, could clean up Twitter and curb some of the nastiness that's become synonymous with it. Or perhaps a new owner would just show more ads. Or let it languish while it mines the best of what Twitter now has into its existing products and services. All of this is speculation, of course, and there might not even be a new owner. Twitter's stock has plunged after rumored bidders are, well, rumored to be no longer interested. On Thursday, the company announced that it would cut 9 percent of its workforce globally as its revenue growth slowed. While its adjusted earnings beat Wall Street expectations, it reported a loss of almost $103 million before one-time charges and costs are removed. A new parent - whether that's Google (huh?), Salesforce (who?) or Disney (hmm...) - could inject fresh life into a 10-year-old company that's never turned a profit and remains confounding to many people. Of course, none of these potential suitors have acknowledged interest in Twitter, let alone their plans for it. Even if Twitter stays independent, drastic changes to its service might just be what Twitter needs to be competitive with Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. How might it change? --- TWITTER BECOMES MORE LIKE ITS NEW OWNER, IF THERE IS ONE Facebook's absorption of Instagram and WhatsApp in recent years could offer clues. Both services have kept separate identities, to an extent, and have experienced user growth. But slowly, they are acquiring Facebook-like features. For example, Instagram no longer presents feeds chronologically; they are now sorted much like Facebook's news feed, using some secret formula known only to Facebook. Though the change has turned off some early Instagram users, its user base has soared, to 500 million as of June. That's nearly 200 million more than Twitter, even though Instagram is three years younger. As Instagram gets more users and a mainstream appeal, its content has diluted somewhat. But many of the street photographers, graffiti artists and tween mini-celebrities who made Instagram what it is are still there - maybe just harder to find. --- STAYS THE SAME BUT WITH MORE ADS Twitter has never turned a profit, and whoever buys it will need to fix this. That means boosting the user base, so advertisers would follow. That also could mean better targeting, so that ad rates go up. Google, anyone? The search giant is the leader in online ads. Imagine what its might and muscle could do to Twitter's ad business. YouTube hardly had any ads when Google bought it; now, ads are so prevalent that YouTube is able to charge $10 a month for an ad-free version called Red. Instagram has also inserted ads into users' feeds of perfectly composed snapshots featuring everything from cappuccino foam to seafoam. It started out slowly with a carefully curated ad here and there, but today you're not likely to avoid ads when opening the app. --- A TOOL FOR BRANDS, NOT REVOLUTION Jonathan Cowperthwait, a Twitter user since 2008, said he'd be worried if Google bought Twitter because the online search giant "is the worst" at social services that aim to foster online interactions, beyond email. Its Google Plus service never took off; Orkut and Dodgeball closed. Cowperthwait said that rather than let Twitter live independently, Google might "try to shoehorn it back into their own social product." Salesforce, a company that provides internet services to businesses, has also been mentioned as a contender, leading to a lot of head-scratching among users. Would Twitter become a business product, used for customer service and marketing instead of revolutions, neo-Nazi memes and political outbursts? "Salesforce is a very technology-driven company," eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. "It seems they would want (Twitter) mostly for the data that Twitter has." --- THE LITTLE BIRD FALLS OUT OF THE NEST Remember MySpace? It was - the - social network before Facebook came along. News Corp., the stodgy media conglomerate, bought it for $580 million in 2005. But users started falling off as MySpace failed to keep up with Facebook's speedy innovations. After layoffs and failed relaunches, News Corp. sold the fallen giant for $35 million in 2011, and that was just about the end of it. It's not unthinkable that Twitter could suffer the same fate under a big media company. --- SILENCE! Walt Disney's reputation as a squeaky-clean, family-friendly company is perhaps the clearest antithesis to Twitter's soul, as many users see it - even though Disney is much bigger than Mickey Mouse and owns ABC, Marvel and the "Star Wars" franchise, among other properties. "My chief fear is that Disney will wield Twitter as one large PR machine to prop up their image and squash dissent," said Timothy Hayes, an Ohio State University student who says he fell in love with Twitter in high school. "The Mouse is not above silencing (its) opponents." Some users, on the other hand, might welcome some thorough housecleaning that goes beyond the steps Twitter is currently taking to curb abuse and nasty behavior on its service. Brant Moeller, a Twitter user who runs a Brooklyn-based creative agency, says that while Google has improved YouTube "in ways that were unimaginable at the time," he finds many of his fellow YouTube users difficult to deal with. In this sense, it's possible that even with Google's weight behind it, the abusive and nasty nature of many Twitter comments would remain as is. © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

THE FUTURE Google's 'Moonshot' Business Feels the Pressure Google's 'Other Bets' category of ambitious experiments lost another $865 million this quarter and numerous executives over the last year. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a reporter for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Reporter, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Google has long held that investing in potential world-changing "moonshot" projects was crucial to the company's innovation strategy. By all appearances, it's still a priority--but it's starting to look like reality is bringing at least some Google's lofty ambitions down to Earth. As parent company Alphabet announced in its earnings report Thursday, the Other Bets division is losing--big. The branch, which houses the company's long-term moonshot projects, lost $865 million in the third quarter. This is nothing new: This arm has lost upwards of $800 million each quarter since Alphabet started reporting its revenues separately last year. What is new is the company's apparent move to start thinking more about the bottom line. For one, the company invested $59 million less into its moonshots than in the same quarter a year ago--the opposite approach of what you'd expect from a division that has prioritized long-term projects over short-term financial solvency. And recent changes in strategy on some of its projects suggest that the company is adjusting its ideals. Last week, Google Fiber, the company's project to deliver high-speed Internet throughout the U.S., announced it was halting its expansion. The company's chief executive, Craig Barratt, stepped down as part of the announcement. Currently, about half the U.S. has only one provider option. Fiber intended to install ethernet infrastructure in cities throughout the U.S. as it has already done in Kansas City, Nashville, and Atlanta. In June, though, the company acquired wireless service provider Webpass, a signal that it planned to switch its plan from a more expensive, long-term cable infrastructure to a more cost efficient and immediate--though potentially less reliable--Internet delivered over cell networks. And in August, Alphabet CEO Larry Page reportedly told Fiber to trim its workforce in half and cut its spending by 90 percent. "As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way and that some efforts will be more successful than others," CFO Ruth Porat said on the company's earnings call. If Google is in fact making a conscious effort to curb its moonshots, who could blame it? They're expensive, and in many cases, they're facing rocky outlooks. Nest, which also falls under the Other Bets category and makes smart home hardware, lost co-founder and top executive Tony Fadell to a resignation in June after months of reported tension among its leadership. Verily, Google's health sciences branch, lost 12 top employees in a recent year-long stretch. While it has partnered up with health giants on several ambitious projects, a March report in the Boston Globe's medical publication suggested that many employees found CEO Andrew Conrad to be divisive and impulsive and felt left in the dark on important decisions. Google's self-driving car project, meanwhile, lost its CTO in August. Two former Google engineers, including the project's technical lead, left in January and founded Otto, which this week made headlines for successfully driving a shipment of 50,000 cans of Budweiser 120 miles in an automated truck. Google has been trying to get its own project out of the lab. Last year, the company hired former Hyundai CEO John Krafcik to take over its self-driving project, indicating that it was moving away from the science project phase and focusing more on commercialization. Google CEO Sundar Pichai did his best not to raise alarm during Thursday's earnings call. "We generally want to encourage a culture of innovation. It is fine that some of them happen outside," he said. "We don't view it as a zero sum game." Still, one has to wonder what the future holds for Google's moonshots. The company declined to comment for this story. All that said, Alphabet is still investing upwards of $1 billion each quarter on long-term projects--an amount that only a handful of companies could even afford to spend, if they were so inclined. And aside from Fiber, the projects are still progressing. Like the self-driving project, Project Loon--the company's attempt to beam Internet connectivity from hot air balloons to rural areas across the world--in August hired a new exec to lead the project toward profitability. Loon was recently spotted testing its balloons over Yellowstone National Park. Alphabet's interest in becoming an Internet provider is double-fold, since more people on the web means more people using Google. Currently, about 90 percent of Alphabet's revenue comes from advertising via Google's search function. The company certainly is not in any immediate trouble: Ads pulled in $18.9 billion of the company's $22.45 billion revenue in the third quarter. Still, the reliance on that one money-maker is a big motivator in the company's attempt to find a moonshot that can help sustain it going forward. Published on: Oct 28, 2016 Advertisement

They are working on everything from driverless cars to simple software security solutions in order to make things more exciting and easier for consumers. Their latest innovation comes from the Android Experiments convention, which is an online “celebration of the creative, ingenious, and surprising things developers are making with Android.” Google engineers decided that since they had been receiving so many new and unique inventions, they would create something as well. Thus, Google’s Sprayscape was born. This is a gyroscopic camera that takes pictures on the inside of a 360-degree sphere. The resulting picture is a kind of VR experience that requires a simple point and tap. There’s also an element of personal creativity to the mix. It has the functionality to let you spray faces, places, or anything else onto a canvas to create a collage of photos and creativity. Regarding the process of using Sprayscape for VR pleasure, Google offers the following description: “Sprayscape is a quick hack using the phone’s gyroscope to take pictures on the inside of a 360-degree sphere. Just point your phone and tap the screen to spray faces, places, or anything else onto your canvas. Like what you’ve captured? You can easily share your creations via a link in a text message or on social media with friends. They can jump into your scapes and have a look around using their phones or even Google Cardboard for a more immersive experience.” It all starts when you download Sprayscape from Google Play for free. Then, you can begin taking photographs and linking with your friends immediately. The reviews so far have been average at best. On Google Play, it has a 3.2 rating with more than 500 views. Here are some of the reviews: “As advertised, but still wtf. It does what it says, but I’m really lost on the purpose of this. The results are just plain ugly and pretty useless. I know this isn’t meant to be photosphere, but I just see no use for whatever this is.” – 3 stars, Richard Craig “Relax. Stop freaking out and comparing this to Photospheres because they even say it’s imperfect and messy and is meant to be a fun and creative toy. I do think though this has the right idea, if perfected, to be a great way to capture Photospheres without the tedious stitching and whatnot.” – 5 stars, Shawn Westphal All in all, users think it’s a fun app to play with, but it’s missing some key features that would make it truly useful. It probably wasn’t meant to be a useful app, but rather a fun virtual toy. In that respect, it’s innovative and fun, but it hasn’t exactly filled a need in the market or managed to completely wow its users.

Boosts Buybacks After Another Great Quarter With a strong ad business and promising progress in "Other Bets," the internet search giant is repurchasing (exactly) $7,019,340,976.83 in shares. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Oct 28, 2016 at 6:42PM IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced stronger-than-expected third-quarter 2016 results Thursday after the market close, marking its fourth report since shifting to a segment-based reporting model earlier this year. With Alphabet stock up 1% as of this writing after briefly touching a fresh all-time high, it's apparent the market is happy with what it had to say.  Let's take a closer look at how Alphabet kicked off the second half of the year. The headline numbers Consolidated quarterly revenue increased 20.2% year over year, to $22.45 billion, and would have increased 23% if it weren't for the effects of continued foreign-currency pressure. Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), consolidated operating income grew 22.5% year over year, to $5.77 billion, and net income rose 27.2%, to $5.06 billion. GAAP net income per share also increased 26.5%, to $7.25, for each of Alphabet's class A and B common shares and class C capital stock. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation, operating income grew 24.2% year over year, to $7.63 billion, and net income rose 24%, to $6.33 billion. Adjusted net income per share grew 23.3% year over year, to $9.06. Keeping in mind that last quarter, Alphabet completed all share repurchases under its previous repurchase authorization, its board of directors also authorized a new repurchase program of up to $7,019,340,976.83 shares. As an aside, Alphabet could have made its latest repurchase authorization an even $7 billion, but it would have sacrificed an opportunity to make another very Google-esque joke. Astute math geeks quickly figured out that 7019.34097683 is equivalent to 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) to the power of "e," an important mathematical constant. And this replaces Google's previous authorization, which allowed repurchases of up to $5,099,019,513.59 -- which is the square root of 26 multiplied by $1 billion. Getting back to the headline numbers, Google doesn't provide specific quarterly financial guidance. So for perspective -- and while we don't typically pay close attention to Wall Street's expectations -- analysts had predicted Google would report lower revenue of $18 billion and adjusted earnings of only $8.64 per share. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat called it a "great third quarter" adding, "Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we're excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets." Breaking it down Alphabet once again offered color on its two primary operating segments, including Google and Other Bets.   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Growth (YOY) Google segment revenues $18.534 billion $22.254 billion 20.1% Google operating income $5.807 billion $6.778 billion 16.7% Other Bets revenues $141 million $197 million 39.7% Other Bets operating income (loss) ($980 million) ($865 million) N/A DATA SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. On Other Bets During the subsequent conference call, Porat was quick to offer the caveat that, "[W]e think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer-term horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy [...]." After all, as I pointed out in my earnings preview earlier this week, the Other Bets segment consists primarily of early-stage, pre-revenue businesses that operate in a variety of different industries. The majority of Other Bets' $197 million in revenue -- an increase of nearly 40% over the same year-ago period -- was generated as per usual by Nest (connected home products), Fiber (high-speed internet), and Verily (longevity solutions). And the segment remains consistently unprofitable, generating an operating loss this quarter of $865 million. To Alphabet's credit, Other Bets' operating loss, excluding stock-based compensation (SBC), would have been "just" $665 million. And even accounting for SBC, this quarter's loss narrowed significantly from $980 million in the same year-ago period, even as capital expenditures dedicated to the segment rose 19.6% year over year, to $324 million, mostly reflecting continuing investments in the Fiber business. Finally, Other Bets' capital expenditures remain a small fraction of the $2.43 billion the company dedicated to its core Google business.  Speaking of which... As a reminder, Google's segment businesses include Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play, and Gmail, as well as Ads, Commerce, Apps, Cloud, and hardware products. But as expected, the main driver of revenue for most of Google's segments remains advertising. Thankfully, that core revenue source continued to enjoy robust growth. Advertising revenue at Google increased 18.1% year over year, to $19.82 billion, representing 88.3% of Alphabet's total revenue, and down slightly from just over 89% last quarter. Within that, advertising revenue from Google's own websites grew 22.9%, to $16.09 billion, and ad revenue from Google Network Members' sites rose 1%, to $3.732 billion. During the call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's advertising business is "thriving in a mobile world," thanks largely to its simple, resonating value proposition to marketers as enabled by Google's suite of vastly popular mobile properties from Search to YouTube, Maps, and Google Play.  "They are using our services because they want to actively watch something they are passionate about, or because they want to know, go, do, or buy something," added Pichai. "It's just like people used to be glued to their TV screen during prime time -- our services are prime time for the mobile world." Growth in aggregate paid clicks accelerated to 33% year over year this quarter -- up from 29% last quarter -- including 42% growth in paid clicks on Google websites, and a 1% increase in paid clicks on Google Network Members' sites. On the other hand, aggregate cost-per-click -- which helps quantify how much Google makes per ad -- declined 11% year over year, including a 13% drop on Google sites, and a 14% decline on Google Network Members' sites. This includes a rapid increase in YouTube's TrueView impressions, which tend to reach consumers earlier in the purchase funnel, so generally monetize at lower rates than traditional web-based ads. Even so, Google is working to make this up in volume. In addition to YouTube's inherent growth, the company recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase online awareness of their brands. And early tests indicate that YouTube generates nearly twice as many Google and YouTube searches for their brands than comparable TV impressions. Last but not least, we can't forget revenue from Google's non-advertising sources. Thanks to strong performances from both Google Play and Cloud, "Other" Google revenue grew 38.8% year over year, to $2.43 billion. There were no big positive or negative surprises in this report. It's important, however, that the company's core ad business stays healthy, and that it continues to methodically invest in promising complementary growth opportunities. More than anything, this represents the latest in a string of strong reports from Alphabet. All things considered, it's no surprise to see shares hovering near all-time highs right now.

The slogan: “Ghostriding for the masses.” More About: The Changing Automotive Landscape George Hotz at Tech Disrupt Day 2016.  Getty Images Advertisement Self-driving cars are getting closer by the day, but they won’t be coming from hacking phenomenon George Hotz. Hotz, the first person to jailbreak an iPhone and a vagabond of the world’s top tech companies, has scrapped his self-driving project after receiving a stern letter from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Hotz said via Twitter that he would be exploring other products and other markets. “I would much rather spend my life building amazing tech than dealing with regulators and lawyers,” he wrote. “It isn’t worth it.” While Google, Uber, and a crowd of automakers pour billions of dollars into self-driving technology, Hotz took the Best Buy route, cobbling his system together with cheap, off-the-shelf cameras and GPS units paired with artificial intelligence software that “learns” en route. He had been at it about a year. When Businessweek went on a ride along in December, Hotz’s white Acura had a joystick where a gear shift knob would be and a 21.5-inch Dell computer screen mounted vertically on the center console. He said his prototype cost about $20,000, roughly what Google pays its interns over the course of a summer. “Don’t touch any buttons, or we’ll die,” he said at the time. Popular Now Tesla’s Future in Trump’s World Five Rules for Selecting the Best KPIs to Drive Operational Improvement The Changing Face of Direct Materials Over time, Hotz, who has worked briefly at Google, SpaceX, and Facebook, essentially trained the system as if it were a 15-year-old, driving manually for hours while the computers recorded what he was doing. Over time, it got better and better. His plan was to sell the system, dubbed “Comma One,” as an after-market kit for $999. The slogan: “Ghostriding for the masses.” comma ai @comma_ai the comma one: comes in any color you want as long as it's neon green https://t.co/RG66S6j5ja Twitter: comma ai on Twitter The NHTSA letter, penned Oct. 27 by the agency's top attorney, reminded Hotz that his venture would be considered a manufacturer of motor vehicle equipment and, as such, is subject to federal oversight. “As you are undoubtedly aware, there is a high likelihood that some drivers will use your product in a manner that exceeds its intended purpose,” it read. comma ai @comma_ai Got this in the mail today. https://t.co/BsEANVWoXn First time I hear from them and they open with threats. No attempt at a dialog. -GH 1/3 Twitter: comma ai on Twitter   Among other things, the agency asked for a copy of Comma One installation steps, user instructions, and a description of what might happen if the system were put in a car that doesn’t support it. If Hotz didn’t respond by Nov. 10, he risked penalties of up to $20,000 a day. “Mr. Hotz’s decision to cancel the product is his own,” NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas said in an e-mail. Hotz didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The magic and wonder of self-driving dreams have taken a dark turn in recent months. In May, an Ohio man was killed when his 2015 Tesla drove itself under the trailer of an 18-wheeler in Florida. The white side of the rig didn’t stand out against the bright sky, according to the automaker. A few weeks later, NHTSA released data showing the largest increase in U.S. traffic fatalities in almost five decades. While some have said the grisly metrics makes a case for fast-tracking robot cars, others argue that automated driving systems are exacerbating accidents by inciting driver distraction. Regulators, traditionally laissez fare about self-driving technology, jumped into action and opened a probe into the fatal Tesla accident. Meanwhile, the Transportation Department unveiled in mid-September a set of 15 rules outlining how driverless cars should be tested and programmed. In recent weeks, Apple and Alphabet’s Google have vastly scaled back their auto ambitions. Meanwhile, Hotz has been dialing back the promise of his creation. In an Oct. 20 blog post he warned the system “will not turn your car into an autonomous vehicle.” Hotz says it is essentially a much better version of features like lane-keep assistance and adaptive cruise control, which are increasingly common on contemporary vehicles. It’s hard to imagine that there aren’t a number of other code jockeys out there running systems similar to Hotz’s, perhaps they aren’t as well known or facile with publicity. As long as there have been cars, grassroots engineers have hacked them. They used to do it with wrenches and duct tape; now they turn to processing chips and lines of code. NHTSA won’t find them all, though the Hotzs of the world are beginning to bump up against similar technology coming out of Detroit. The giants of the auto industry have been investing heavily in hackers of their own and fine-tuning automated systems. “The old conversation I used to have was, ‘You guys are going to end up being the handset, you’re going to be low-margin assemblers of other people’s cool technology,’” Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford told Bloomberg last week. “We don’t want to be the handset. And we won’t be.” As for Hotz, it appears that today’s news will cost him a bet against Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Hotz had promised that he would best Mobileeye, the driver-assist package that went into Teslas. “Frankly, I think you should just work at Tesla,” Musk wrote to Hotz in an e-mail. Perhaps, the offer is still good. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 4 RichandNotFamous on Oct 31, 2016 There's something missing from the article, the NHTSA doesn't say answers to technical questions are required. The request/demand letter requires you to acknowledge the you received the request. It's kind of like the form for jury duty. The letter simply gives you notice that answers to the questions will be required before approval for larger, more advanced test regimes. There may be more questions, but you are definitely going to have to answer those in the letter. You get the same letter, different questions, for pretty much anything that's new and ultimately intended for use on public roads. We went through it with the old "car phones" that were actually installed in the car. GM got the same letter when they decided to do away with mechanical throttle cables in favor of fly-by-wire throttle controls in some models. Unknown to almost everyone, OEM HID headlights got the same pre-test study guide, but the DoD and DoE were involved as well and sent their own letters. For better or worse, if you are serious about shaking up established industries as anything more than a speed bump then government regulators and lawyers are part of the deal. I'm not sure if you can even find an industry more infested with lawyers than the auto industry. I find it hard to believe the Hotz fellow didn't know that going in. In fact, if he's maintaining a dialogue with Elon Musk there's no way he didn't know the red tape and the associated costs wouldn't be astronomical. Companies with near unlimited funds and technical resources, like Google and Apple, have publicly acknowledged they underestimated the costs and technical hurdles on the road to autonomous cars (ha!). I wager that's the case with the Hotz guy as well, but he doesn't have the funds to continue throwing it at the project. Admitting you don't want to go completely broke in a one man battle against enormous companies isn't admitting defeat. It's being smart and it doesn't sound nearly as arrogant and commercially sanctimonious.

I get technology like blind spot and back up sensing, lane drift and emergency braking, but again as more and more technology is introduced, it makes drivers less involved and more likely to be distracted and complacent. I have been around the auto industry nearly my whole life, and I can not recall ever hearing anyone say they wished they owned a car that drove itself Log In or Register to post comments jjusko on Oct 31, 2016 What about the elderly who no longer can drive?

Google, Facebook, 2K score with NBA interns 0 Share: Tech Culture by Terry Collins October 28, 2016 2:14 PM PDT @terryscollins Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech It's no stretch to say Hollis Thompson knows how to hustle. The Philadelphia 76ers swingman -- he plays both shooting guard and small forward -- regularly shows his mettle in the fast break or transition, or with a clutch shot. This summer, the NBA helped the fourth-year Georgetown product take his skill set to a new arena: business. For two weeks, Thompson interned at 2K, the video game company that makes the popular NBA2K and Mafia III titles, pitching big retailers Target and Walmart at the E3 gaming conference in Los Angeles. "It was pretty exciting and more hands-on than I could've even imagined," Thompson said in an interview. "Besides playing basketball, this was one of the best experiences of my life." Thompson isn't the only baller looking beyond the NBA, whose regular season tipped off on Tuesday and heads into its first full slate of weekend games. Twelve other players joined the league's Career Crossover, an unpaid job-shadowing program that matches players with companies in different industries to spark interest in "second career" possibilities. The NBA leverages its corporate partnerships -- companies love to associate themselves with pro sports -- to secure opportunities for players. Greg Taylor, the league's senior vice president of player development, says increasingly that's meant tapping tech behemoths, such as search giant Google and social network Facebook, because the tech industry is cropping up more often in post-career conversations with players. Philadelphia 76ers' swingman Hollis Thompson, as he appears inn the NBA2K 17 video game. Thompson interned at game maker 2K this summer. Photo by 2K In addition to Thompson, other players who spent time at tech companies include vets Ryan Hollins and Al-Farouq Aminu, at Facebook, and C.J. Watson, Dahntay Jones, Wilson Chandler and Moses Ehambe, at Google. "The main purpose of this program is exposing the players to multiple career options and letting them see what skills they need to develop in order to be competitive in this other world," Taylor said. Technology companies were popular destinations because "this generation of players lives and breathes with technology and their smartphones." The NBA players union is also stirring interest in post-basketball career possibilities. In July, the union held its inaugural tech summit in San Francisco to connect players with Silicon Valley companies. The three-day event was led by Golden State Warriors swingman Andre Iguodala, a renowned tech investor and a vice president for the union. Fans see headlines about millions of guaranteed dollars and wonder why any ex-player would need to take a job. They read about all-time greats, like Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, and imagine all players will be as successful off-court as they are on. Basketball doesn't last forever The reality, says Michael Goldman, a sports management professor at the University of San Francisco, is usually different. "I'm far more concerned for the lesser known, midlevel players who are living a high life," Goldman said. "Then suddenly it all stops, possibly due to injuries or declined play, and they're struggling with what to do next." That's why Thompson and peers like Hollins, a journeyman center still looking for a contract in what will be his 10th season, all volunteered to take part in the NBA program. For some, like Watson, a 12-year veteran who's in the second of a three-year, $15 million contract with the Orlando Magic, the end of a career is within sight. At Facebook, Hollins and Aminu, a forward for the Portland Trail Blazers, spent time with the company's sports partnership division, which handles the Facebook's relationships with sports leagues and sports media outlets, as well as product and marketing specialists.

Hollins and Aminu were asked for their opinions of the Oculus Rift, a virtual-reality headset a Facebook subsidiary makes, as well as Facebook Mentions, Instagram and Facebook Live. Hollins said the experience was too short -- just two days -- but well worthwhile. If a second career in the broadcast booth doesn't pan out, he says, he's going to pursue tech. NBA players Ryan Hollins, left, and Al-Farouq Aminu pose in front of an Instagram logo while spending time at Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters as part of the league's Career Crossover program. "There's a real push to have internet access everywhere. How do we get this to Africa, Haiti and India?" Hollins said of Facebook. "That's commendable." The social network, which has hosted NBA players on its campus for three summers, calls it a "mutual learning benefit." "We're just as excited to hear what they have to say," a Facebook spokesperson said. "Their feedback on our products and insights into their social media behavior are invaluable for our teams." At Google, the NBA players sat in with teams that build the search firm's varied products, which range from its core business to email to storage. They sat in with the YouTube business, which is working to monetize its popularity. Watson, a point guard on the Orlando Magic, told me he was enthralled with Google's program on self-driving cars, which had a fun but intense atmosphere. "They sort of want to be the cool kids," Watson said. "They do a lot of things outside the box, which I respect." A Google spokesperson said the partnership was valuable to Google because it valued the NBA's culture of collaboration, strategic foresight and leadership under pressure. "In fact, we use the term 'general athlete' when we describe who we're looking to hire," the spokesperson said. "People with highly transferable skill sets who can hit the ground running when they get here." Video gamesmanship 2K had even more ambitious plans for Thompson, an avid gamer, and wasted no time putting him to work, says Alfie Brody, a marketing vice president. After time spending a week at E3 in Los Angeles, Thompson, 25, headed back to 2K's headquarters in Marin County, California, pitching in with the development teams on the popular NBA2K game, widely praised as one of the best sports video games on the market. Thompson also worked alongside engineers, designers and artists for the franchise. His responsibilities: providing them with feedback on the players he's faced, to help the game capture that real feel. He also weighed in on his own player rating -- 72 -- which he thought was too low (LeBron James of the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers has a 96 rating, and reigning NBA MVP Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors has a 94). Thompson offered his opinion on other aspects of the game, too, particularly the MyTeam and Franchise modes, where users can create their own NBA franchise, with its own look and team name. The baritone-voiced Thompson said 2K took his feedback to heart. "I think I was surprised by the amount of people involved and the work that goes into making a game," he said. "It's a much bigger operation than I thought." 2K was impressed, Brody said, and Thompson has an open invitation to return next summer. "Hollis knows things right down to the smallest detail," 2K's Brody said. "He provided a ton of insight into the life of an NBA player." Thinking about his future, Thompson, who just had his $1.5 million team option contract picked up by the Sixers this season, said he's game with 2K. "Yes," he said, "I'm definitely coming back."

Alphabet was formed last year, in part, to insulate the lucrative online advertising business of its Google division from riskier, more capital-intensive projects now called Other Bets. The strategy was on display in the company’s third-quarter results, released on Thursday. The technology giant culled investment in Other Bets and doubled down on Google’s cloud and artificial-intelligence initiatives.  Those investments will only accelerate next year, executives told analysts during a conference call that followed a strong third-quarter report, driven largely by growth in Google’s main digital ad business. The shares rose 1.1 percent to $825.98 at 9:44 a.m. in New York Friday. Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said the cloud business is building a team focused on machine learning, an important branch of AI, and is hiring aggressively. "As we head into 2017," he said on the earnings call, "I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and growth." Cloud Growth Google is racing against Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other big technology companies to provide AI-powered services over the internet from remote data centers. The combination of these technologies may produce powerful and lucrative new products for consumers and business customers. Google doesn’t disclose the performance of its cloud business. But its "other revenue" line, which includes this unit along with the Google app store and hardware sales, saw revenue grow 39 percent to $2.4 billion in the third quarter. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the cloud division is "generating substantial revenue growth." Cloud chief Diane Greene has helped win new corporate customers for its data-processing, analysis and storage services this year. Google is still behind market leader Amazon.com Inc. which posted a 55 percent gain in cloud revenue on Thursday, reaching $3.2 billion for the third quarter. However, Google executives’ rhetoric suggests Alphabet is plowing money into businesses capable of generating strong returns, and cutting investment from projects with more questionable financial potential. Porat also cautioned investors that marketing spending will rise in the fourth quarter to promote new Google hardware like its Pixel smartphones. Pichai and Porat have told investors before that Alphabet’s biggest bets are inside Google. Pichai oversees most of the company’s AI and virtual reality efforts, along with its costly data centers. Yet shout-outs for the cloud business came amid a pullback from Alphabet’s Other Bets, particularly its Google Fiber internet service and Nest connected-device subsidiary. Other Bets Trimmed The Other Bets segment, which also includes the autonomous vehicle project and two biotech research initiatives, lost $865 million in the third quarter, narrowing from a $980 million loss a year ago. Growth in capital expenditures on these businesses also slowed down from the prior two quarters. Porat stressed that Other Best are on a "longer time horizon," but also said Alphabet is resetting some of them as they strive to find business models. Earlier in the week, the Fiber internet service announced a retreat from eight major proposed markets as well as jobs cuts and the loss of its top executive. That followed a string of high-level departures from Other Bets companies. "News that Fiber has been ‘paused’ should be welcomed by investors concerned over rising CapEx," Daniel Salmon, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to investors. Porat said Fiber had made "important breakthroughs" in wireless technology, but is re-evaluating expansion plans. "We wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we re-accelerate deployment," she said. Pichai shrugged off the executive exits. He also dismissed concern about other notable departures from Alphabet, including a team of veteran engineers from its self-driving car project, who were recently acquired by Uber, and Niantic Labs, the company behind the viral mobile game Pokemon Go. "We generally want to create a culture of innovation, and that’s what we focus on and it is fine that some of them happen outside," he said. The CEO also noted "world-class products" from Alphabet that serve over one billion users. All of them come from Google. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Now under the Alphabet umbrella, Google is becoming a brand - for online services yes, but also for hardware. Leading the charge are the Pixels, Google's equivalent to Samsung's Galaxy or Apple's i-gadgets... and every bit as premium. True, the Pixel name debuted with a Chromebook, later adopted for an Android tablet, but it will definitely be remembered for the phones. This must be the company's biggest marketing push for a Google-branded hardware product. It's not just that, Google even put a promo for Allo on the most valuable real estate on the web - Google.com. Allo, if you haven't heard, is the new messaging client (paired with video chat app Duo) and is at the heart of the Pixel phones. The AI assistant available in Allo is more prominently featured in the Pixels and you can talk with it, not just text. Then there's Google Photos, Google Drive and so on. This perfectly mirrors Apple's strategy of iMessage, iCloud, etc. Software is Google's forte, but the company is new to hardware. With both Apple and Samsung flexing supply chain muscle, will the hardware of the Google Pixel XL live up to the pricing that exactly matches the iPhone 7 Plus (and tops the Galaxy S7 edge)? Let's see. Google Pixel XL key features: Aerospace-grade aluminum unibody (glass window on the back); splash and dust resistant (IP53) 5.5" AMOLED screen of QHD resolution, 534ppi, 100% NTSC; 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 Quad-core Kryo processor, Adreno 530 GPU, 4GB of RAM, Snapdragon 821 chipset Google-loaded Android 7.1 Nougat; 2 years of OS upgrades from launch, 3 years of security updates 12.3MP camera, f/2.0 lens, 1.55µm pixels, Phase and Laser AF, dual-LED, dual-tone flash; 2160p and 1080p @ 30/60/120fps video capture 8MP selfie camera, f/2.4 lens, 1.4µm pixels; 1080p video capture Comes with 32GB or 128GB of built-in storage, no expansion Fingerprint reader, Android Pay LTE Cat 9 or 11 (450Mbps or 600Mbps downlink, 50/75Mbps uplink); Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 (A2DP, LE), GPS + GLONASS, NFC 3,450mAh battery; Fast charging over USB Type-C Main disadvantages: Most expensive Google phone yet No stereo speakers No water resistance No OIS for the camera No wireless charging, no IR port or FM radio Snapdragon 821 chipset is downclocked to 820 speed Standard Nexus cons: no microSD slot, sealed battery Design is arguably bland We openly admit to being a little salty. Don't get us wrong, we haven't been spoiled by the likes of Xiaomi, OnePlus, ZTE and others. Hell, you can buy TWO Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus phones for the price of one Pixel XL, that one has a Snapdragon 821 too, not to mention dual cameras and no weird glass windows on the back. What we're pouting about is that the Pixel XL isn't clearly better than the Nexus 6P it is supposed to replace and it didn't bring back any of the features that the 6P dropped from the Nexus 6 spec sheet. Not a good time to be cutting features, especially when Apple has everything short of an Always on screen (which the Pixels also lack) - dual cameras, water resistance, the best mobile chipset, truly awesome screen, even stereo speakers! Apple was in the opposite situation compared to Google - it was known for its hardware, its software was laughed at (remember Apple Maps at launch?). But now iMessage is one of the best respected messengers, iCloud is reliable and cheap, even Maps has improved massively. Can Google walk the same path in the other direction - from beloved software (Search, Maps, Android) and an overpriced Chromebook Pixel to the world's best smartphone? We have a ticket to the preview show and it's called the Google Pixel XL - shh, the trailers are starting!

Many practitioners have a safer option if they work for a healthcare system that uses a mobile app like Citrix Receiver. That provides a secure tunnel that lets clinicians send information from a smartphone, tablet, or laptop to an electronic health record system located elsewhere. But not everyone has access to Citrix applications. In smaller practices with limited finances, other options to consider are a standalone virtual private network (VPN)1, an encrypted cellular service, and Google's Business Associate Agreement (BAA) -- covering Gmail, Drive, and Docs. A VPN will encrypt data as it is sent across a Wi-Fi connection, but setting up one of these networks can be quite complicated for someone without advanced training in information technology. A much less painful option is using a commercially available VPN vendor. PCWorld and Lifehacker both offer recommendations on viable candidates. Linking one's smartphone to a laptop is another way to make the transmission of protected health information (PHI) more secure, assuming the smartphone is encrypted. For example, on Apple's iPhone, it is possible to set up a personal hotspot that tethers a laptop or tablet to the phone's wireless Internet service. Of course, it is also important to encrypt the phone itself with a passcode and to update its operating system regularly. Google has also set up several of its apps to make transmitting PHI more secure on the Internet. The company offers a subset of core services that are HIPAA-compliant, including Gmail, Google Drive (which in turn includes Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms), Google Calendar, Google Sites, and Google Apps Vault. Users are required to sign a BAA with Google and follow a set of requirements spelled out by the company on its website. The HIPAA-compliant versions of these apps are only available through Google's "Apps for Work" subscription service, which involves a nominal fee. In the future we'll go into the details of Google's HIPAA offerings for smaller medical practices.

The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc's Google, which crashed Apple Inc's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google's Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft Corp's Cortana. "We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information," Rakowski said in an interview.   LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button." The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words "OK Google." By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google "doesn't have to do negotiations with another handset maker - they can make it as tight as they want," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. "If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator," said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. "They will be relegated to just pushing hardware." Google is coy about its plans. "Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible," Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company's earnings call on Thursday. "The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience," he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie," he said. "I approach this the same way."

REUTERS/Beck DiefenbachMore By Julia Love (Reuters) - About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc's Google, which crashed Apple Inc's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google’s Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Corp’s Cortana. “We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information,” Rakowski said in an interview.  LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button.” The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words “OK Google.” By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google “doesn’t have to do negotiations with another handset maker – they can make it as tight as they want,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. “If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. “They will be relegated to just pushing hardware.” Google is coy about its plans. “Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible,” Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Read More Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. “The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience,” he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it’s not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie,” he said. “I approach this the same way.” (Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Bill Rigby) Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

By Jack Wallen | October 28, 2016, 1:33 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen Google Drive power users, you can get quite a bit of mileage out of having quick access shortcuts to various folders on your Google Drive account. With certain homescreen launchers, you could easily create shortcuts to various locations; however, with some newer launchers (especially the Google Now Launcher), that ability has vanished. So, what do you do? Fortunately, Google had the foresight to include this feature in the latest releases of the Google Drive Android app. The feature isn't exactly obvious, but once you know how it's done, you'll be shaking your head at how easy it is to add these shortcuts to your homescreen. When you use the feature, you'll find it's a quick way to access your work folders while on the go—no more navigating through Google Drive's folder hierarchy. SEE: Mobile Device Computing Policy (Tech Pro Research) Adding those shortcuts More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter Believe it or not, the feature is hiding in plain sight. Here's what you have to do. Open the Google Drive app. Navigate to the parent directory housing the folder in question. Long press the folder you for which you want to create the shortcut. In the resulting popup toolbar, tap the three vertical dots (Figure A). Tap Add To Home Screen. Figure A Image: Jack Wallen Creating a home screen shortcut on a OnePlus 3. Creating a folder of shortcuts You don't want a homescreen crammed full of Google Drive shortcuts. To avoid such clutter, tap and drag one of the shortcuts onto another to create a folder. Once you've done that, you can drag all of your Drive shortcuts into that folder and then tap the name of the folder to give it an appropriate name (Figure B). Figure B Image: Jack Wallen You now have instant access to those folders you access on a regular basis. You can always create multiple homescreen folders...each with a specific department, client, data center, etc. This way you have quick access to those Drive folders you use the most...without getting confused or cluttering up your homescreen.

Look hard enough and you’ll spot references to Jaws, The Goonies, The Karate Kid, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Twin Peaks, and dozens more flicks from one of sci-fi’s golden eras, nostalgia that evidently struck a cord. An estimated 14 million people watched the series in its first 35 days of availability, number that were apparently music to Google’s opportunistic ears. On Friday, the search giant announced a partnership with Netflix that will see Stranger Things’ most iconic scenes and characters appear in Allo, Google’s voice messaging app. Allo, for the unaware, is akin to messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, and the like. You sign up with a mobile phone number, and your conversations are synced locally to your phone. You’re mostly limited to messaging other Allo users, but an SMS relay lets you invite others to download and install the app. Related: Despite mixed reviews, Google Allo has more than a million downloads in three days Stranger Things is premiering on Allo in the form of a sticker pack that will no doubt ring a bell for any devotee of the show from the Duffer Brothers. There’s a graphic “Lando” cap, a sketched-out homemade slingshot, an animated seven-sided board game die, an impressionistic cathode ray tube TV, and more. All are a free download from within Allo’s sticker storefront, and appear alongside other images and GIFs in the messaging interface when installed. And for Allo users who happen to live in New York City, there’s more: an AI-powered scavenger hunt. Type “Where is Barb” — a reference to a Stranger Things character’s untimely end — and you’ll receive directions to a location in the city’s SoHo district. From there, Allo will map the way to a “mind-control vending machine” that will drop a “suggestion chip.” That chip, when tapped, will divulge the location on one of several ’80s-era Halloween treats: a sticker, a BMX bike, a Panasonic boombox, a Pentax camera, and more. Related: Hands-on: Google Allo It’s not the first Stranger Things collaboration between Google and Netflix, believe it or not. The two tech giants worked together to craft a terrifying virtual reality experience for Google Cardboard, Google’s handset-powered VR hardware. The Stranger Things tie-in is just one fresh coat of paint Allo’s gotten in recent days. A major update added a monochrome theme, a landscape orientation, direct messages, and the ability to reply to messages directly from notifications on iOS and Android. On iOS, you can now scribble on photos before you send them to friends. And on smartphones running Android 7.1 Nougat, Allo gained compatibility with the operating system’s split-screen mode — you can, for example, carry on a conversation in one window while watching clips from Stranger Things in another. Finally, it now plugs into the operating system’s new GIF keyboard tool and launcher shortcuts — you can search for animated clips to send a friend while you’re chatting, or quickly start a new conversation from the Allo shortcut on your home screen. Allo may not be the blockbuster for Google in the same way that Stranger Things was for Netflix, but it has done well enough for itself. The nascent messaging platform managed to rack up more than a million downloads in three days, growth likely attributable to tight integration with Google’s intriguing eponymous intelligence, the Google Assistant. It’s an artificially intelligent bot that performs Google searches, plays games, sets alarms and reminders, and even suggests contextually appropriate replies to messages. Related: “Stranger Things” Season 2 is confirmed! Here’s everything we know Allo’s launch hasn’t been without its rough patches. After Google backtracked on a decision not to store Allo communications, privacy advocates including Edward Snowden protested, arguing that the service, which doesn’t encrypt most messages, would be subject to surveillance by law enforcement. (Allo offers secure messaging in Incognito Chats, involving secure messaging channels between a variable number of users, but it isn’t enabled by default.)

Google parent Alphabet's better-than-expected third-quarter results show that while the company continues to rely heavily on advertising dollars, some of its other businesses—most notably its cloud unit—have begun contributing meaningfully to the top line. Revenue from Google's cloud business and the sale of digital content via its Play store accounted for $2.4 billion, or more than 10 percent of the $22.3 billion in revenues that the Google segment under Alphabet made last quarter. That number represented increases of 39 percent from the same period last year and 12 percent sequentially. During the earnings call on Oct.28, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat pointed to the revenue growth as a sign that Google's investments in different businesses is beginning to pay off. "Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business as well as the enormous opportunity in this area," Porat said. During the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai touted "strong customer engagement" for the company's cloud business. He pointed to Google's setting up a separate cloud unit, its investments in machine learning, and the growing portfolio of products and services in this category as evidence of Google's commitment to deliver new capabilities for its cloud customers. Over the next year, Google will add eight new cloud regions, including Mumbai, Singapore, Sao Paulo and Frankfurt, he said. "As we officially move into the Google Cloud era, our goal remains the same," Pichai said. "We want to build the most open cloud for all businesses and make it easy for them to build and run great software." For the most part though, Google's revenues continue to be heavily ad-dependent. About $16.1 billion of the $22.3 billion Google generated in revenues last quarter came from ads placed on Google websites, including Search, YouTube, Maps and Finance. Third-quarter revenue was 23 percent higher on a year-over-year basis and 4 percent higher than second-quarter revenues. As it has for the past few quarters, ads displayed in mobile search results contributed significantly to the increased revenues from Google websites. Some of the growth also came from YouTube ads—which, according to Porat and Pichai, continue to be a high-performing area for Google. Revenues from ads on Google network member websites, including those sold via its AdSense, DoubleClick and AdMob, grew a modest 1 percent year-over-year to $3.1 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet's "Other Bets," the name the company uses for its collection of disparate business ventures, such as Nest, Fiber and Verily, continued to swim in red ink, though somewhat slightly less so than last year.  Combined, Alphabet's Other Bets accounted for an $840 million operating loss on revenues of $197 million, compared with a $980 million operating loss on $141 million revenues in the same period last year. Porat urged investors to look beyond the short term for the Other Bets. "Quarterly revenues can be lumpy for three primary reasons," Porat said referring to the performance of the Other Bets segment. "First, the Other Bets are early-stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And finally, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals," she said. Google chalked up third-quarter net income of $6.3 billion, representing earnings per share of $9.06. The company held in excess of $83 billion in cash and securities at the end of the quarter.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   How the Internet Came of Age as a Campaign Tool in 2016 Election Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards YouTube Now Providing Support for High-Definition Video Cloud Native Computing Foundation Adds New Project, Grows Membership Microsoft Adds Kubernetes for Azure Cloud Container Orchestration                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Oct 28th 2016, 9:45 PM 25,572 Views 24 Comments Share64 Tweet Email Jennifer Lawrence (left) and Kate Upton Source: PA AN AMERICAN MAN has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hacking the accounts of Hollywood stars, which led to the online release of private nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and other celebrities. Ryan Collins, 36, was sentenced in a US District Court in Pennsylvania for a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The computer hacking charges were related to illegally accessing “over 100 Apple and Google email accounts, including those belonging to members of the entertainment industry in Los Angeles”, the US Justice Department said. The “Celebgate” hack led to the online publication in 2014 of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities including Rihanna, Avril Lavigne and Gabrielle Union. The statement did not refer to the victims by name, but several of the victims spoke publicly about the pictures. In May, Collins entered a guilty plea in connection with the hack, and admitted to a “phishing” scheme to obtain passwords, in order to then get nude pictures from the victims’ cloud online storage accounts. No evidence However, officials said there was no evidence that Collins published the pictures online. “Hackers violate federal law whenever they access private information stored online and in digital devices,” said Eileen Decker, US attorney for the central district of California. Decker said that her office will hold hackers accountable “even when they do not sell or distribute the stolen data”. By gaining illegal access to the email accounts, “Collins accessed at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts, many of which belonged to female celebrities”. Collins would sometimes also download the entire contents of the victims’ Apple iCloud backups. Collins also “ran a modelling scam in which he tricked his victims into sending him nude photographs”. In September, Edward Majerczyk agreed under a deal with federal authorities to plead guilty to one felony count of unauthorised access to a protected computer in the same “Celebgate” case. © – AFP, 2016 Read: The FBI is re-opening the investigation into the Hillary Clinton email saga Read: Fighter jets escort plane to Scottish airport after communications fail Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-10-28 Print               Pixel phones are exclusively offered through Verizon or Google, but T-Mobile is offering buyers monthly rebates to switch their service. Google's popular new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones may be available exclusively through Verizon and Google, but that's not stopping T-Mobile from offering rebates to get buyers to move their new phones over to the Un-Carrier's network. T-Mobile is now offering any Google Pixel or Pixel XL buyer a $325 rebate—equal to half the cost of a 32GB Pixel smartphone—in equal bill credits over 24 months to switch their mobile service on their Pixel or Pixel XL handset to T-Mobile from Verizon. T-Mobile announced the offer on Oct. 27. The offer is available to new and existing T-Mobile customers for first-time owners of a Pixel or Pixel XL phone who moves to T-Mobile's One mobile plans. Pixel phones are sold as unlocked handsets. "If you think you can only purchase and use the Pixel on Verizon… that's simply not true," the company said in its announcement. "Don't let the 'exclusive' advertisements fool you, the Pixel phone is tested and proven to be fantastic on our lightning-fast network, and we want to help you get the best of both worlds," John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile, said in a statement. "I'm a huge fan of what Google has done with the Pixel, and now consumers can use it the way it should be used—with truly unlimited data on the fastest 4G LTE network in America." The monthly offer is good for any 32GB or 128GB Pixel or Pixel XL handset and gives customers an automatic $13.55 bill credit each month for 24 months, totaling $325, or half the price of a basic Pixel 32GB phone. The deal can be obtained by buying any Pixel phone and presenting proof of purchase through T-Mobile's online validation site, according to the carrier. The offer is good within 30 days of the receipt of a Pixel handset and will still be honored if shipping delays occur with the phones due to tight supplies at present, said T-Mobile. The rebates will be offered as long as a customer's Pixel phone has been ordered during the eligibility period, according to the terms of the offer. One monthly Pixel rebate is offered for each phone, and the deal is available for up to eight lines per customer. Since going on sale Oct. 20, Google's Pixel and Pixel XL Android smartphones are so popular that several versions are completely out of stock and others are apparently taking longer to get to buyers than Google previously estimated. All 5.5-inch Pixel XL handsets in Quite Black or Very Silver are out of stock in both 32GB and 128GB configurations, while the 5-inch Pixel models in certain configurations—32GB in Very Silver and 128GB models in Very Silver and Quite Black—are shipping in two to three weeks, according to the Google Store's ordering page. Other standard Pixel models are completely out of stock, including the Pixel 32GB Quite Black version and the 32GB Really Blue Limited Edition version. In an email reply to an Oct. 27 eWEEK inquiry, a Google spokesperson said the company is "working to restock our inventory as soon as possible." The 32GB 5-inch Pixel phones sell for $629, while the 128GB Pixel sells for $749. The larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL handsets sell for $769 for the 32GB models and for $869 for the 128GB versions. The Pixel handsets, which Google has designed and engineered, are sold only through the Google Store and Verizon, including Verizon mini-stores inside selected Best Buy stores. The standard Pixel phone has a 5-inch full HD AMOLED display, which is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 4, has a 2,770mAh battery, and is 5.6 inches tall, 2.7 inches wide and 0.3 inches thick. Its larger stablemate, the Pixel XL, has a 5.5-inch quad HD AMOLED display, a Corning Gorilla Glass 4 cover and a 3,450mAh battery, and is 6 inches long, 2.9 inches wide and 0.34 inches thick. The phones are the first Google devices to include the latest Google Assistant services built-in to assist consumers in their everyday lives. Both phone models feature a metal unibody design with curved edges, a Snapdragon 821 MSM8996 quad-core processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 memory, a 12.3-megapixel auto-focus, rear main camera with an f/2.0 lens and an 8MP front-facing, fixed-focus camera with an f/2.4 lens. The two handsets can capture and play 4K video as well as 1080p and 720p video. Both models also include a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor for device and user security, fast charging that can provide up to seven hours of use from a 15-minute charge, a USB Type-C port, a 3.5mm headset jack, a single SIM receptacle and a single bottom-firing speaker. Also included is 24/7 technical support for the handsets through a preloaded app that gives tech support personnel the ability to examine the phone remotely after the owner consents to the assistance. In addition, both handsets include Google's new Android Nougat operating system with automatic updates in the background and free unlimited storage of photos and videos at original quality and full resolution through Google Photos. The handsets come in Quite Black or Very Silver in 32GB or 128GB versions, but only in a 32GB version in the other color choice, Really Blue.             LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul NXP Unveils New Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles Google Moves to Mobile-First Indexing for Search                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

IBM employees on an assembly line for the Ramac, the first computer with a hard drive, on August 29, 1959, in San Jose, California. [Photo: Getty Images/Bettmann/Contributor] Harry McCracken 10.28.16 4:00 PM Next week, IBM is formally opening Watson West—a San Francisco outpost for its Watson "cognitive technology" platform, which the company is training to help everyone from doctors to merchants make smarter decisions. Occupying three floors of a gleaming office building in San Francisco’s startup-heavy South of Market neighborhood, the office includes both space for employees involved in the Watson effort and a slick demo center where IBM can whip up enthusiasm among third-party developers, prospective customers, and other outsiders. Watson West is, in part, a statement about IBM’s desire to embed itself in the San Francisco Bay Area tech community. But it’s also less of a striking departure than the latest chapter in a long story. IBM may be the archetypal big East Coast tech company, but it's understood the benefits of being at home in the Bay Area for decades, dating back to the era when it was a manufacturer of automation equipment, and the computer was still in the process of being invented. Watson West IBM long ago shifted its emphasis from big iron to software and services. With Watson, it's a key player in the race to use machine-learning technology to train computers to understand big data in an array of fields—an industry trend that, in one way or another, has also swept up everybody from Google to Facebook to Microsoft to Apple. "IBM has a lead on this, having started a couple of decades ago," says Watson General Manager David Kenny, who is still a newcomer to IBM, having joined the company when it closed its acquisition of his former employer, the Weather Company, in January. Computer scientists at the IBM Research-Almaden lab in San Jose were part of the AI research that made Watson possible in the first place and are helping to chart its future. Now, with Watson West, the company has a presence "at the top of the [San Francisco] peninsula as well as the bottom," Kenny says. That's particularly important as Watson becomes the foundation for capabilities that can be commercially deployed in specific business sectors—a process that frequently involves startups who build on top of IBM's work. "Many of those companies are on the West Coast and funded by VCs on the West Coast," says Kenny. David Kenny Helping such companies work with IBM with as little friction as possible is key to Watson fulfilling its potential. "People can always travel, and people will travel for the most important relationships," says Slack cofounder Stewart Butterfield, whose startup announced this week that it was partnering with IBM to let third-party developers build Slack chatbots powered by Watson intelligence. What you lose with distance is the ability to participate in forms of collaboration and community such as hackathons without giving it a second thought. "You can fly out over and over again for that kind of stuff, or you can be in the Bay Area and catch the action," Butterfield says. (In the case of the IBM-Slack collaboration, Slack happens to have search and intelligence staffers based in New York, which let them commute by foot to Watson headquarters in the city's Astor Place neighborhood, eight blocks away. But some meetings—including ones involving Butterfield—took place in San Francisco.) In The Beginning When IBM first put down roots in Silicon Valley in 1943, the area was known for its bounteous orchards, not technology. The company bought a 34,000-square-foot factory in San Jose and began manufacturing punch cards for its tabulating machines. (The computer industry didn’t exist yet, though IBM was at work on research that helped create it.) "Our decision to establish a plant on the Pacific coast is based not only on the large amount of business that we now have in the territory, but on our belief that after the war, the Pacific coast will be a far greater industrial district than ever before," explained legendary CEO Thomas J. Watson Sr. It would take decades before it was clear just how prescient he was. In 1952, the company added to its San Jose presence with a lab based in the city’s downtown area. Four years later, one of the industry’s landmark achievements happened there when a small team of researchers invented the hard drive, which the company used as part of an accounting computer called the 305 RAMAC. The 305 RAMAC, a 1950s room-sized IBM computer, was designed and built in San Jose.[Photo: Wikipedia] At about the same time, as part of a push to raise its profile on the West Coast, the company broke ground on an ambitious, innovative 190-acre research/manufacturing operation located on land formerly devoted to walnut groves. In 2014, I wrote about this prototypical Silicon Valley corporate campus, including the strange story of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev's visit in 1959. (He was more impressed by the cafeteria than the computers.) In 1986, IBM Research’s San Jose arm moved into its current home, IBM Research–Almaden. Judged purely on the surrounding natural splendor—rolling hills, parks, and preserves—it may have the most beautiful setting I’ve ever seen for a tech-company office. But the location, at the southern end of San Jose, is not exactly convenient to the rest of Silicon Valley. You need to do a fair amount of driving to get to Intel (20 miles to the north), Apple (21 miles), Google (26 miles), and Facebook (33 miles). That locale—proximity to the Valley's ecosystem, but not too much proximity—is intentional, even though many of its biggest players didn’t exist back in 1986 when the Almaden office opened. "When the labs were first started, the idea was to place them near strong academic centers and strong centers of business and commerce, but not right in the middle of them, necessarily," says Jeff Welser, the IBM VP who heads the Almaden operation. The original research center in Yorktown Heights, for instance, is about 40 minutes north of New York City. IBM Research-Almaden in all its atmospheric splendor. "We wanted to be close enough in that we can interact and take advantage of everything there, but separated enough that we can actually also do our work in our own area," says Welser. "Think deep thoughts, as our founder would say. In fact, actually at lunchtime, you'll see people literally walking a loop around this lab because you get a beautiful view of the valley." Jeff Welser The Almaden building does feel like a refuge where gifted scientists can squirrel up in their offices and put their brainpower to work without distraction, though it's hardly antisocial. (An open area called THINKlab is specifically designed to facilitate collaboration between IBM clients and researchers with various areas of expertise.) IBM Research's rich legacy testifies to the approach's success. "Historically speaking, large corporate research organizations have had varying kinds of success," says Guru Banavar, VP of cognitive computing. "I would say IBM corporate research has been the most successful in terms of scale and impact." As the official IBM Research-Almaden timeline indicates, the facility’s three decades of history are a chronology of what was important to the company at any given point in time. Data—how to store it, retrieve it, and make it useful—has been an ongoing theme. In 1970, the relational database was invented there. In 1988, its researchers created a standard for speedier data recording on a disk. In 1998, as mobile devices gained in importance, the lab developed the Microdrive, a tiny hard disk. And in 2002, it proposed a database designed with protecting the privacy of personal data in mind. Today, "If I had to sum up in a nutshell what this lab does," says Welser, "it's all about using data to expand what the human mind can do. That really is in essence what cognitive computing is about." Despite IBM Research-Almaden's scholarly air, people are drawn here in part by the opportunity to create things that will be turned into businesses. "If you are someone who really wants to do academic research, you want to be a professor, you want to teach the next generation of students, a university is the right place to go." Welser says. "But if you want to be able to do deep research and have that get translated rapidly into something in a very broad portfolio of potential application areas, that's the kind of person that really likes IBM Research." Watson is best used to help human beings make more effective decisions more quickly. Some of the most wildly ambitious of those efforts—ones of the sort that Google would call moonshots—are instigated by IBM's Grand Challenges program. Watson itself originated as a Grand Challenge, back when the notion of training a computer to play Jeopardy better than a human champion sounded—at least to those of us who aren't among the world's savviest computer scientists—to be downright fanciful. That challenge was met. And now IBM researchers are leveraging Watson to tackle feats that could be far more meaningful than providing questions for Alex Trebek's answers. Welser defines a Grand Challenge as "something that, at this point, we don’t know if we can do or not, but if we could do it, it would make a huge difference to us, to our clients, to the world." One such project, dubbed "the Medical Sieve," aims to use cognitive-computing technology to analyze radiology images for signs of abnormalities such as aortic aneurysms. The Medical Sieve exemplifies IBM's philosophy that Watson is best used to help human beings make more effective decisions more quickly, rather than to eliminate humans from the decision-making process altogether. "A radiologist in a typical emergency room situation may look at as many as 100,000 images a day," says Tanveer Syed-Mahmood, the IBM fellow who heads up the effort. "With that volume of imaging, they do have an overload in terms of high fatigue." The Medical Sieve's goal is to create an automated assistant that's as skilled at analyzing images as an entry-level radiologist, thereby freeing up time for medical professionals such as cardiologists to focus on work that requires their advanced expertise. Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood Of course, a task that would be entry-level work for a person is a remarkable accomplishment for a computer. "It has to apply clinical knowledge," says Syed-Mahmood. "It has to understand the appearance of organs in images and recognize them from different viewpoints. It has to reason with the information, know what the guidelines are, in order to cull this data, simplify it, and present it to the clinician." A range of IBM experts in AI, image processing, and medical topics are collaborating on the effort, along with external partners such as doctors; in 2015, the company also acquired Chicago-based imaging company Merge Healthcare to aid in the effort. IBM Research's Medical Sieve aims to turn computers into medical-imaging experts. Elsewhere in IBM Research-Almaden, other scientists are working on "brain-inspired computing," a project—funded in part by the U.S. Department of Defense's DARPA—to create processors that think like humans. In the future, data centers utilizing vast quantities of such processors could be optimized for AI applications such as Watson's cognitive computing in ways that current computers are not. Dharmendra Modha, the IBM fellow spearheading this research, is an IBM veteran who left for a spell to form his own startup, but he was lured back by IBM Research-Almaden's ambition, approach, and resources. "I live just down the hill here," he says. "Every day, I come up and it's just such a fresh experience that I'm grateful." Watson In San Francisco The fact that IBM Research-Almaden is situated on the southern periphery of Silicon Valley means that it’s really quite far from San Francisco, which is well over an hour's drive away. But San Francisco, more than Silicon Valley, is the current epicenter of startup culture, which made it the logical place to build Watson West. (IBM already has another San Francisco office located right around the corner from Watson West: IBM Bluemix Garage, which helps developers and customers work with its cloud platform.) If IBM Research labs are traditionally built a little out of the way to encourage contemplation, Watson West more or less flips that approach on its head: It's an interface with the outside world that's right in the middle of everything, with sweeping windows that never let you forget you’re deep in the heart of San Francisco. The headquarters of kids’ clothing retailer Gymboree are across the street—so close that its employees play tic-tac-toe with IBMers using a game board affixed to a window. A peek at the Watson Experience at Watson West before its grand opening. Much of the space at Watson West is devoted to rows of cubicles for developers, designers, and researchers, looking pretty much like the environs of any tech company. But there's also the Watson Experience Center, an area that IBM will use to show outsiders what cognitive computing is capable of doing for their businesses. Like its predecessor at Watson's New York headquarters, San Francisco's Watson Experience Center has a high razzle-dazzle component; I find it reminiscent of a futuristic pavilion at Disney World's Epcot. A giant projection wall controlled by a touch screen lets visitors explore demos such as one involving a browsable guide to TED Talks that Watson created by crunching hours of raw footage and identifying topics and people. Nearby is a 360-degree multimedia theater where IBM can show off lavish, interactive mini-movies about specific Watson scenarios, including applications in medicine and commerce. I can't imagine anyone spending time there and leaving without feeling inspired by Watson's potential. IBM's decentralized approach to innovation involves 12 labs on six continents. Bay Area startups and other locals who want to learn about cognitive computing are the most obvious constituency for Watson West, but IBM expects to draw guests from near and far. "A lot of people from around the world who do tours of Silicon Valley ask for a place to go as they figure out how to put all this together," says Kenny. But that brings up an important point: Just as IBM has been in the Bay Area for more than 70 years to accomplish tasks it can't handle solely from the East Coast, it has aspirations that it knows can't be fulfilled entirely by people based on the West Coast of the United States, no matter how skilled they are. That explains why IBM's approach to innovation is so decentralized, with 12 labs on six continents. "If you think about the kinds of challenges that developing countries in Africa or developing countries like Brazil might face, having researchers there immersed in it helps us come up with what they might need there," says Welser. "Rather than me guessing, from this beautiful place I live in California, what they might need in Africa. That's really the idea of having a whole global spread." In other words, the company that's still formally known as "International Business Machines" remains deeply serious about the "International" part of its name—and Silicon Valley, important though it is, is only one pushpin on its map.

The pop-up is to celebrate the new 2017 New York City Restaurants Guidebook and the relaunch of the restaurant review iOS app from the Google-owned company. The app offers restaurant guidance from editors who curate snippets from user reviews, with the data coming from Google's Local Guides program. Using that same concept — "small reviews are easier to digest" — the pop-up offers free, tiny versions of food from the top-rated restaurants on the app. I'm a long-time lover of tiny food, so nothing was going to keep me away from my chance to eat microscopic versions of New York's best-rated, most Instagrammed meals. Standing around the outdoor pop-up in 40-degree weather, I waited for my food amid the deafening sounds of ambulance sirens and construction. My phone eventually shut down from the cold, and I anxiously waited for it to turn back on, using my own body heat to warm it. Yet I persisted; I had to do it for the 'gram. In NYC? Stop by the #TinyCafe at Astor Place tomorrow and Saturday from 11-7 to watch tiny dishes be made (and then eat them!). We've got @jacquestorres chocolate chip cookies, @lostacos1 tacos and @pizzalovesemily pizza and burgers. And they're free!

A sharp gust of wind blew the tiny portions of tiny food away, shattering the doll-furniture plates and sending miniscule hamburger buns flying across the sidewalk. I laughed at the disaster and internally cried from the cuteness of it all, then patiently waited for another batch of tiny food to come out. Three bites and approximately 45 calories' worth of food later, it was over. Taste-wise, it was about the same as the originals. I'd had the $19 full-sized version of the burger from Emily before, and the experience was like taking an extremely small, crumb-sized bite out of it. But I wasn't there for the food, of course. Like any self-respecting millennial, I was there to be able to say I was there. I wiped my nose, and left to go get regular-sized lunch.

By Jack Wallen | October 28, 2016, 11:10 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen For some users, the Chromebook isn't an option because they believe it exists entirely in the cloud. With the latest iteration of Chrome OS (on certain devices), that has become a completely outmoded idea. Now that Google is rolling out Android app support for more and more Chromebooks, it is absolutely possible to take the devices back from the cloud and work locally. Although it is has been possible to achieve this from the start by working offline, people weren't happy until they had their hands on a standard locally-running/saving app. Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy That time has come. Now that you can run Android apps on Chrome OS, the likes of WPS Office can be added to the Chrome OS arsenal of productivity apps. The best part is you can link WPS Office to your Dropbox account and work both out of and in the cloud. Let's install WPS Office and link it to a Dropbox account. SEE: Chromebooks: The smart person's guide Installation The first thing you must do is install WPS Office—this can only be done on a Chromebook that supports the installation of Android apps. To find out what devices are currently supported and on which devices support is coming, check out this official list. You will also need to have the Google Play Store enabled on your device (read my article, "How to install Android apps on your supported Chromebook"). Now all you have to do is follow these steps. Click the Chrome OS menu. Locate and click the Play Store (beta) icon. Search for WPS Office. Locate and click the entry by Kingsoft Office Software. Click INSTALL. Allow the installation to complete. You should see an entry for WPS Office in your Chrome OS menu. Click to open the app. Connecting Dropbox You're ready to work with local files, using WPS Office. If you want to extend it to the cloud, when you open WPS Office, click Open from the left pane (Figure A). Figure A Ready to connect WPS Office to Dropbox. Click the Dropbox entry and then, when prompted, click Next. You will be required to enter your Dropbox credentials (Figure B). After entering your credentials (and hopefully your two-factor authentication code...as you should have that enabled), click Allow to give WPS access to the files and folders within Dropbox. Figure B Logging into Dropbox through WPS Office. After you've allowed WPS access to Dropbox, the app is linked and ready to go. Every time you open WPS Office, you can click Open | Dropbox and your files/folders will be available. You can also add your Google Drive account to WPS Office by clicking Add (from Open | Location), select Google Drive, enter your credentials (and, once again, your two-factor code), click Allow to give WPS access to your Drive files, and you're good to go. SEE: Gallery: Samsung's high-end Chromebooks breaks cover (ZDNet) A perfect combination If you want to work with documents locally on your Chromebook and Google Drive offline isn't cutting it for you, the combination of WPS Office and Dropbox are a perfect combination. Not only does this allow you to work locally, you can also easily get your files saved to your Dropbox cloud account. Add your Google Drive account to WPS, and you might stop using Google Docs in favor of this outstanding solution. For more cloud tips and tricks, subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter.

Freebies Inspiration Advertise Hosting Ecommerce Platforms Website Builders Ecommerce Websites Navigate to Updates The Ultimate Guide to Optimizing SEO in WIX October 27, 2016 • By Design Reviver Team If you’re running a site on the WIX platform, you may have some questions as to how you can go about optimizing your SEO and making sure that potential customers find you through places like Google and Bing. WIX has a wonderful mix of design possibilities and SEO options. It’s rather easy to implement changes to content, while also having the tools to rank in search engines. Furthermore, even more advanced developers can get their hands dirty with custom coding and more complex SEO tactics. Building a website is one thing, but ensuring that it’s visible online is a completely different animal. In addition, one of the biggest questions about WIX is whether or not it has the tools necessary to make your site all that visible online. We figure many WIX users simply don’t know how to go about handling the complexities of SEO, or they don’t feel like spending the time. However, optimizing SEO with WIX is actually pretty darn easy, and we figure many webmasters just don’t have a comprehensive list on what to optimize. Therefore, follow the steps below to optimize SEO on WIX. Step 1: Fill in Your Entire Site with Valuable Content Although the following steps are more technical in nature, nothing in the SEO world beats having the proper information filled in on your website. For example, a site for a car hardware store is not going to see any search engine results if it fails to reveal contact information, a map, an About Us page, services, a contact form and other information like social media profiles. Therefore, start the SEO process by combing through your website and ensuring that all the information is there. Step 2: Manage Your Image SEO The reason we have this as Step 2 is because so many people forget about image optimization. It’s one of the few ways you can truly standout from your competitors, because so many companies forget about it. When in the WIX editor, you have the option to upload an image or edit the images currently on the website. You can click on an image to reveal the Image Settings. You’ll see a field that says “What’s in the image? Tell Google.” This is the alt tag for your image, or the text that explains what the image is to Google, since search engines can’t read photos. You shouldn’t get too crazy with your image SEO, since the whole point is to make it more useful for the users and search engines. So, if you have a photo of a red apple, call it “red apple.” This is far better than having a generic name or something like “screenshot123.” Step 3: Optimize Your Heading and Meta Tags If you have content on a page, WIX generates heading and meta tags for you by default. The only problem is that manually adjusting these is usually better than going the automated route. In short, these tags are what show up as titles and descriptions in Google search results. Therefore, it’s rather important to make them count. In the Pages tab, go to the Home button. Then click on the SEO (Google) tab to open up options for modifying your heading and meta tags. It will ask you to fill in the page’s title along with what the page is all about. This way you have more control over what users are seeing when they land on one of your search engine listings. Step 4: Activate the Site Booster App One of the main reasons webmasters hire SEO professionals is to get listed on internet directories like Google Maps, Yelp, Yahoo and Bing. It’s tough to fill in all of these listings by hand, so paying someone to do it seems logical. WIX has an alternative to paying a professional, and it comes in the form of the Site Booster App. Click on the prior link, and click on the Add App button. This activates it for your store and asks you questions (like contact information, hours and what you sell) for filling in a directory profile. After that, all the work is done for you, since the app sends out the necessary details to the hundreds of directories people search through. Step 5: Consider Completing 301 Redirects for Necessary Pages If you plan on shifting some pages, or a full site, to a new domain, you may be worried about losing the SEO power you built up from the previous site. This doesn’t apply to every person reading this article, but if you’re concerned about transferring a site or making a new webpage to replace an old one, we recommend checking out the 301 redirect documentation from WIX. Step 6: Get a Custom Domain and Create a Professional Online Presence You can have a free WIX domain, but a great way to make your brand look more professional and legitimate to the search engines is to opt for a custom domain. When you purchase a domain through Wix, you can choose from 33 different domain endings. Each TLD has its own benefits, so you can find the one that best suits your website. Step 7: Let Google Know About Your Website Google will eventually find your site overtime. However, if you feel like it’s taking too long, or you’d like to speed up the process, you might consider submitting to Google. It only requires a quick copy and paste, then the process is started to ensure that Google sees your site and presents it to people who search for your services or products. Step 8: Check All Your Bases With SEO Wizard The SEO Wizard from WIX is your best friend after you’ve walked through all of these SEO steps. It’s an app that serves as a step-by-step guide to optimizing your website. The app tests all of the primary SEO steps, and tells you if you could use some work in some of the areas. Over to You… If you’d like to find out more bout Wix SEO , please check out their informative page. Now that you’ve had a chance to learn about optimizing your SEO in WIX, please share any other SEO thoughts you might have when working through platforms like WIX.

WSJ's Geoffrey Fowler and Joanna Stern gaze into our near future. December 30th 2015 a year ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Artificial intelligence is being used to predict and prevent crime, though in a different way to Minority Report. Picture: Supplied Jennifer Dudley-NicholsonNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend EXCLUSIVE “YOU’LL be sitting at your desk one day and an ambulance will come and take to the hospital because you’re about to have a heart attack. The ambulance will just arrive.” This is the extreme scenario Telstra chief scientist Dr Hugh Bradlow foresees as a result of artificial intelligence increasingly added to our gadgets, from smartphones and wearable technology, to connected appliances and Fitbits. GOOGLE TRICKS: 13 hidden features inside Google’s Pixel smartphone PIXEL PERFECT: Can Google’s first phone beat Samsung and Apple? The programming, he says, could be used to do everything from predicting and preventing crime, to picking restaurants and ensuring travellers don’t find themselves homeless. And the pace of AI innovation is accelerating, with Google emerging as a major advocate of smarter technology. Google Assistant is the artificial intelligence engine built into the internet giant's new Pixel smartphone. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Dr Bradlow says the heart-saving scenario above will be possible as long as you feed the right information to the right computer. “You could be wearing a Band-Aid that measures your heart rate and that information is transmitted to a data centre running an algorithm looking for anomalies,” he explains. This artificial intelligence could be used to prevent crime too, though in a way divorced from Minority Report. The Stanford University study Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030found “predictive policing,” or using computers to analyse crime information, could “significantly” enhance the police force’s ability to predict where crimes would happen and “actually remove or reduce human bias”. The technology is already being used in American cities including New York City and Washington DC, but Dr Bradlow says it could also play a part in smartphones. “Just say I want to go to a restaurant that’s safe for me to walk to,” he says. “If I ask my phone, it might not make the most obvious choice, but it might say this is the safest restaurant and I’ll make a booking. “It’s got your preferences, data from public sources like weather and traffic, and then data from organisational sources like crime data. It just aggregates them all.” While artificial intelligence has been used in small but convenient ways to date, Google is now throwing its weight behind making the technology mainstream. The internet giant recently launched its first phone with AI program Google Assistant built in, and users can ask the Pixel smartphone to translate foreign words, announce sports results, show their appointments, or find nearby Japanese restaurants. Dr Bradlow says the way Google Assistant is “baked into the operating system” will allow app developers to easily add information, making it smarter and more capable. If your plane is delayed and your hotel had been reserved through an app, for example, AI agents like Google Assistant or Apple’s Siri could contact the company and pass on up-to-date arrival information. While Dr Bradlow admits most people will just use these services to find and book restaurants and movies initially, they could eventually link up with internet-connected appliances, like air conditioners and lighting, to create a smart home that predicts your needs. “I envisage a world in which you say, ‘Goodnight house,’ and the house locks the doors or opens the cat flap, and does all of those things for you in one connected sweep,” he says.

Live Live Now Justin Ross Harris Ray Tensing Murder Trial Past Trials Colleen McKernan Kaylee Whitehall High Profile Celebrity Crazy Important Sports Newsletter Search Follow @law_newz Like us on Facebook Menu Here's Why the Justin Ross Harris Guilty Verdict is Absolutely Bananas Julian Assange Finally Questioned by Swedish Prosecutors About Rape Allegations Now Mike Pence is Fighting to Keep His Emails Away From Public View Yoga Instructor Accused of Murdering Twin Sister After Allegedly Driving SUV Over Cliff Attorney Indicted for Allegedly Impersonating Judge, Wins Judgeship Clinton’s Tech Support Apparently Fell For Scheme That Got John Podesta’s Email Hacked by David Bixenspan | 2:30 pm, October 28th, 2016    Last Thursday, it was first reported that the Gmail account of John Podesta (Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman) was hacked in March through a “phishing” email, or the type of scam that tries to trick you into giving your login credentials to hackers. The hackers who got into Podesta’s emails then archived the account and sent it to Wikileaks. On Friday, the latest daily batch of emails from Wikileaks included a chain starting with the phishing email, in which Clinton’s tech support help desk actually told Podesta that it was a genuine Gmail communication. It all started when Sara Latham, Podesta’s chief of staff, forwarded the phishing email to Charles Delavan, an IT staffer from the campaign’s help desk. Superficially, the email looked real: However, hovering the cursor over the “CHANGE PASSWORD” button would have revealed that the target was a link using the bit.ly link shortening service, something Google wouldn’t use. Someone operating a phishing scheme, however, would use one to hide the non-Google URL. Delavan didn’t scrutinize it to that degree, however, and sent this reply to Latham: Sara, This is a legitimate email. John needs to change his password immediately, and ensure that two-factor authentication is turned on his account. He can go to this link: https://myaccount.google.com/security to do both. It is absolutely imperative that this is done ASAP. If you or he has any questions, please reach out to me at [number removed] In fairness to Delavan, he doesn’t tell Podesta to click the link in the phishing email. Instead, he instructs the chairman to go directly to Google’s official page for password resets and turn on extra security measures as well. Two factor authentication makes it so that anyone trying to log into your account from a new device needs a code that is sent to your phone via text message. However, he never actually told Podesta NOT to click the link in the original email. That was his biggest mistake. Delavan’s vote of confidence led to Latham forwarding the whole chain to Podesta and Milia Fisher (Clinton’s “special assistant”) with this message at the top: The gmail one is REAL Milia, can you change – does JDP have the 2 step verification or do we need to do with him on the phone? Don’t want to lock him out of his in box! Sent from my iPhone It’s implied here that Fisher would be the one who actually ended up clicking the phishing link, since she is who Latham asked to change to password, but we can’t know that for sure. Again, note that with Delavan not making it more clear that whoever changes the password go to https://myaccount.google.com/security, the real password reset page, it makes sense that someone would click on the original phishing link. It may make even more sense if it was Fisher. She was only added to the chain in Latham’s last email, so she could have just read Latham’s final message, which reads like it’s just confirming Delavan’s contributions.

The headset itself costs £69 and comes bundled with a motion-sensitive remote control that can be used for navigation or gaming when you're strapped in. It's more expensive than Samsung's £60 rival Gear VR rival, but I'd argue it's worth paying that extra nine pounds. You can pick it up directly from Google or from EE or Carphone Warehouse. Before plonking down the cash however, beware that you're going to need the right smartphone to get the best out of it. That means, at the moment, you're stuck with Google's £599 Pixel. Read More This little-known Google Street View feature lets you travel back in time AP Photo/Eric Risberg The new Google Pixel phone is displayed following a product event Because the Daydream software is really integrated into the Android 7 operating system so you'll need an Android 7-running phone (and the Daydream app which is available today on the Play Store) to get the best out of it. Other phones running Android 7 will come in 2017 but for now it's only the Pixel and Pixel XL. Obviously there's no support for iPhones, but there's nothing to stop you using it as you would any other 'dumb' VR viewer with applicable third-party apps. Design Google Daydream Read More VR isn't just for gamers: Virtual reality ART exhibition will open in London next year The Daydream View headset is leaps and bounds ahead of Google Cardboard in terms of fit and comfort. For starters, it's got a headstrap. Rather than being made out of plastic like other headsets, it's crafted from fabric more akin to sportswear. Google says the Daydream View is 30% lighter than similar headsets and it can even be washed to keep it clean. It's available in three different colours: Crimson, slate and snow. Which means red, grey and white. It's a well thought-out and attractive design, but even so I experienced light leaking into the headset from around the nose. For best results, dim the lights around you while you use it. As mentioned above, the Daydream View comes with a small remote control that works a bit like the remote sticks for the Nintendo Wii. It tracks motion control and can be used to navigate menus and play games. There's a clever little hook inside the headset where you can store it when it's not being used. Content and usability Google Google's own stable of apps, including YouTube and Street View have already been configured to work with the platform, and you can use the remote to work your way through the apps. One of the big third-party "experiences" is the VR tie-in with JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. It has you using the remote to cast spells that in turn solve puzzles. There are also a few different games to play with. I tried one called Wonderglade which comprises a set of mini games such as moving the remote control to tilt and guide a ball around a virtual tabletop. Google Daydream view Another experience has you stepping inside the Natural History Museum to learn about sea-dwelling dinosaurs. Outside of strict virtual reality, Netflix and Google Play Movies will work with the headset and allow you to watch standard 2D content on a big screen in front of your eyes. The 360-degree vision of Daydream VR isn’t as seamless or crisp as the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, but then it is several hundred pounds cheaper, so bear that in mind. The Pixel phone also got quite hot during usage and - as you would expect - using VR pounds the battery. Read More Google's Halloween game doodle lets you fight ghosts with a spell-casting cat called Momo In terms of usability, compared to the PlayStation VR's headband design, the Daydream headset felt heavy strapped to my face with a smartphone inside it. Even though it’s one of the lightest headsets available (and much comfier than the plethora of plastic headsets around), it still took a few seconds to adjust to the weight pulling my face forward. The only other thing I found is that audio is a bit quiet if you're using it without any headphones. Pair it with a good set of wireless earbuds though and you can happily block off the real world for a while. Not too long though, or you'll find yourself with a headache and eye strain. The bundled controller is a masterstroke from Google because it allows you a point of reference within the virtual world. Read More Google Pixel phone stripped down by tech experts Google Daydream The tracking wasn't 100% on point, but it’s a much better system than trying to select menus using the accelerometer inside the phone. The remote itself is a bit smaller than a Roku or Amazon Fire Stick remote control but feels light and comfortable in your hand. Like many other newer gadgets, it charges via USB Type-C. Conclusion Google Daydream Read More Google Pixel on sale - Best deals and prices on EE, Vodafone, O2 and Carphone Warehouse If you're an Android phone user and have a passing interest in VR then getting the Daydream View is a no-brainer. However, I'd recommend holding off on buying it right away because of the lack of available phones. Developers have been working on it since May, so there's not going to be any shortage of stuff to do on it. But I still reckon it's worth waiting until 2017 and seeing what other phone manufacturers do with it on their own handsets. Of course, if you're one of the people that rushed out and got a Pixel right away then there's nothing to stop you getting a Daydream View headset now.

Revenue jumped 20 per cent to $22.45 billion, marking the search giant’s seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth.   The company authorised a $7-billion repurchase of its Class C stock, pleasing investors who had been craving more after a $5-billion repurchase last year.   Google is competing fiercely with social network Facebook for dominance in the fast-growing mobile advertising market. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai touted the company’s gains in the space, and was bullish about recent product launches such as the Google Assistant, the Google Home smart speaker and refinements to the enterprise cloud business. The products are aimed at the rise of voice search, which many analysts believe will succeed keyboards and touch screens as a primary way users interact with devices.   “We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing,” Pichai said in a conference call. “This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the cloud.” Shares of Alphabet, the world’s No. 2 company by market value, were up 1.6 per cent in after-hours trading.   The company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $9.06, beating expectations of $8.63 a share on revenues of $22.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.   Google has been dogged by concerns about how it would nudge its vast web advertising business toward mobile, but the company’s recent performance has reassured Wall Street that the transition is well underway, said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.   “It’s showing that even though they’ve hit lifetime highs, there’s still room to run,” he said. Advertising revenue, the company’s lifeblood, rose 18.1 per cent to $19.82 billion in the third quarter. Paid clicks, or ads for which advertisers pay only when users click on them, rose 33 per cent, compared with a rise of 29 per cent in the second quarter.   Cost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11 per cent in the latest period, but investors are willing to forgive the slump, for now, as it suggests strong mobile growth, said analyst Kerry Rice of Needham & Co.                Reuters   YouTube continued to post robust gains, Pichai said. Over the past year, Google, Facebook and Twitter have all doubled down on video, a format where advertisers are willing to pay a premium for a few seconds of users’ undivided attention.   Advertising accounted for 89.1 per cent of Google’s total revenue in the quarter, and analysts are eager for the company to tap new sources of growth.   One of the leading contenders is Google’s cloud business, which drove a 38.8 per cent rise in the company’s “other revenue.”   “As we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment,” Pichai said.   A relatively late entrant to the cloud business, Google is trying to steal market share from industry leaders Amazon.com and Microsoft Amazon on Thursday reported a 55 per cent revenue increase in its cloud business.   “I would hesitate to say they are competing head-to-head, but they are making up for lost ground,” Rice said.   Alphabet’s “Other Bets” unit generated revenue of $197 million, primarily from Nest, Google Fiber and Verily units, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the call.   Alphabet said this week it was pausing the rollout of Fiber, a high-speed internet service, in some US cities and that its leader, Craig Barratt, would leave.   Porat played down analysts’ concerns of instability at Other Bets, which has suffered a wave of executive departures, including Nest founder Tony Fadell, self-driving car technology chief Chris Urmson and, most recently, Barratt.   “As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it’s inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,” Porat said.   Other Bets, which also includes research unit X, reported an operating loss of $865 million, down from a year-ago loss of $980 million. The narrowing loss suggests Porat is instilling the financial discipline investors have long hoped to see from the company, said Gillis.“Everybody loves Ruth,” he said.

Alphabet finance chief Ruth Porat said on Thursday that the company's moonshots will face "course corrections along the way and that some efforts will be more successful than others." Corrections are presumably underway, and the public is waiting to see the successes, 14 months after the Alphabet structure was put in place. Financially, Alphabet is still Google and Google is swimming in cash. Mobile, YouTube and search advertising drove third-quarter revenue up 20 percent and helped sales and profit exceed analysts' estimates. Its cash balance sits at $83 billion. Take a look at the Other Bets piece of Alphabet, and it's a very different story. Combining all the units, which include Nest thermostats, fiber for high-speed Internet, health-tech division Verily and autonomous vehicles, revenue equaled $197 million, or less than 1 percent of Alphabet's sales. Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi estimates the value of Other Bets at $7 a share, also less than 1 percent of the company's $817.35 stock price at Thursday's close. show chapters <p>Pro: Google needs to make these two major cultural shifts</p> <p>James Cakmak, Monness, Crespi, Hardt and Co., says Google needs to make changes to its cloud and enterprise strategy.</p> Pro: Google needs to make these two major cultural shifts    Friday, 28 Oct 2016 | 6:05 AM ET | 00:33 Porat made clear that most of these projects are pre-revenue, and that the key thing to look at is progress. For example, autonomous cars have now driven over 2 million miles and are now being tested in four cities, "enabling us to experience varied weather and driving conditions," she said. But problems within Alphabet's side projects go well beyond money. Top executives have been fleeing, leaving Alphabet without many of the visionaries who were tapped to turn moonshots into eventual reality. Nest founder Tony Fadell left in June, and Chris Urmson, the technology chief behind self-driving cars, departed in August. That month, Bill Maris, who founded and led the company's start-up investing arm GV, stepped aside. Most recently and perhaps most alarmingly, Google Fiber chief Craig Barrat announced his resignation this week. Barrat, who has a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford University and holds 34 patents, is the type of executive that was supposed to thrive under the Alphabet structure. In his 2015 founders letter announcing Alphabet's creation, CEO Larry Page listed seven things he was excited about, including "empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish." David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Larry Page chief executive officer of Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. Along with Barrat's exit, Alphabet also said that it's slowing the rollout of fiber. The wireless technology is currently available in 12 cities, with four coming online in the third quarter. Porat said the company is "pausing for now our work in eight cities where we've been in exploratory discussions." Alphabet investors today aren't the least bit concerned. The stock climbed another 1 percent on Friday and is up 12 percent over the past 12 months. It reached a record earlier this week. But this idea that the Google cash cow will indefinitely fund science experiments is now being tested. Even though Alphabet isn't publicly breaking out each unit's financials, the company is closely watching the overall cost structure. "Disciplined cost allocation across core Google and Other Bets, sound capital allocation and compelling valuation keep us positive," wrote Youssef Squali, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, in a report on Thursday after the results. Squali, like 91 percent of analysts covering the stock, recommends buying it. He estimates that revenue growth among Other Bets will slow every year through 2022, from 70 percent in 2016 to 11 percent in six years. Wall Street will likely give Alphabet plenty of latitude to fund those businesses as long as the costs remain immaterial. But conquering autonomous driving, aging, high-speed internet access and drone delivery will require a big combination of money and patience. The hefty turnover at Alphabet suggests that may be a difficult formula to get right.

(View our Privacy Policy) How a dot-com millionaire became a social media crusader against solar amendment Mary Ellen Klas, Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau Link View all Articles MARY ELLEN KLASTampa Bay Times Friday, October 28, 2016 2:30pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Jonathan Taylor, a venture capital investor and online marketing expert from Maitland, is self-financing an online campaign to urge the public to reject Amendment 1. (Courtesy of Jonathan Taylor) TALLAHASSEE — Meet Jonathan Taylor. He's one of those wealthy Internet start-up whizzes who wrote software in high school, moved to Silicon Valley, made it rich during the dot-com surge and created and sold two businesses. He's moved back to his roots in Florida and, at 45, is a self-described "mentor/investor" based in the Orlando suburb of Maitland. Related News/Archive About that solar energy amendment on the Florida primary ballot 3 Months Ago Solar energy amendment headed for primary, but will anyone vote? 3 Months Ago Solar shenanigans: Insider reveals strategy behind Amendment 1 4 Weeks Ago Until two weeks ago, the only political thing Taylor had ever done, he says, was vote. But when he got "irritated about the confusion over Amendment 1," he decided to personally finance his own Internet marketing campaign to "get the reality about the amendment out" and urge people to reject the utility industry-backed amendment that creates a new barrier to competition. "The language reads pro-consumer when in reality it's pro-confusion," said Taylor, a former Republican who says he is now "sort of without a party." "I have many intelligent friends who are pro-solar, who just didn't understand the realities of Amendment 1. It's pretty amazing, actually." Taylor has given himself a budget of $100,000 and, using his years of online marketing expertise, developed social media ads on Twitter and Facebook, created a website landing page called FloridianSolar.org, paid for boosted posts, and called out the utility-financed political committee for breaking Google's online advertising rules. In two weeks, his tracking software indicated that his efforts had reached five million voting-age Floridians. His personal posts, on his company's Entrenext website, reached three million Facebook users, has had more than 55,000 shares and 32,000 likes. Taylor makes a point of noting that he is not affiliated with Floridian's For Solar Choice, the solar industry-backed political committee opposing Amendment 1. "However, I sure like what they're saying," he says on his web site. By law, his effort must be reported by the political committee. It has reported about $36,000 in in-kind contributions last week and another $45,000 this week, said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Taylor's effort is one of dozens of "organic efforts by people who are coming up with their own ways to encourage people to "vote no' on Amendment 1," Glickman said. She has copies of people who have converted used campaign yard signs to Vote No on 1 signs, volunteers who are running phone banks, and a woman who made buttons featuring "a wolf in sheep's clothes" — a reference to what Supreme Court Justice Barbara Pariente called the amendment in a court ruling. Companies have posted information on their business sites; Florida crooner Jimmy Buffett has recorded a video; the Clearwater band Stone Marmot has recorded a song, and they have all done it at no expense to the opposition campaign, she said. The promoters of the amendment, Consumers for Smart Solar, are financed primarily by the state's investor-owned utilities. The group spent nearly $22 million promoting the amendment and running television ads. A telephone robocall from singer Pat Boone is also sponsored by the 60-Plus Association, which is funded heavily by the Koch brothers. By contrast, the Floridians for Solar Choice raised and spent $1.6 million in an unsuccessful attempt to put a rival amendment on the ballot. Taylor said his Internet campaign also revealed that Amendment 1 backers may not have been playing by Google's rules. He found that every Google search about the amendment produced two or three different ads, from different accounts, all pointing to content by Consumers for Smart Solar, the utility-supported political committee that is promoting the amendment. It was a violation of Google's online advertising rules because it drives up the price, intentionally crowds out all the ad positions and creates "an unfair advantage," Taylor explained. "There is no reason to have multiple ads and try to take all the ad positions, because people just click on one of them. They have this big war chest and they are spending it to minimize people's exposure." Taylor said that in his 15 years working on online marketing, "I've never seen anyone abuse the Google advertising ability in that way. It's been banned since the very beginning of search advertising. It's just cheating." Taylor said he took a screenshot, mentioned it on Facebook and then he and others reported it to Google. This week, the multiple ads were down. Google did not respond to requests for comment. Sarah Bascom, spokeswoman for Consumers for Smart Solar, denied that their ads had been "reported, flagged or taken down by Google." She also defended the need for multiple accounts. "With our opponents regularly spreading misinformation, we want to ensure that voters find factual information when they search for answers about Amendment 1,'' she said. "Using different ads allows us to send voters to the right place with the specific answers to their specific search or question." Bascom was not aware of Taylor, or that his effort was self-financed and reported. She suggested he was operating as a "dark money group." "Once again, we are operating in a fully transparent way, and you continue to give the benefit of the doubt to those who are not," she said. "It's the work of these groups, not our committee, that are increasing the cost of online advertising and crowding out his efforts." Taylor said he doesn't own any stock or investment in a solar company, although when he discovered that inventor Elon Musk owns a part of the solar installment firm, Solar City, he divested his stock in Musk's company, he said. He tells readers, "unfortunately I don't even have a solar system on my house right now. I had one two houses ago, but I haven't had time to research putting one on my new house." Taylor also said he has "nothing against power companies" but he doesn't like it "when companies try to fool me with misleading causes." In his research, he said was frustrated to learn that utilities take federal subsidies for their operations but "they don't want you to have them for solar." Taylor, who admits he drives a Tesla because it's "fast as hell," says he's not doing this "because I believe in green energy at any price. "I do it because I believe solar will be the most cost efficient way to generate power in this country in the future,'' he said. "Clearly, the power companies see this, too."

And like mom, it isn’t asking your permission to do what it wants with old photos. While millions of internet users embrace the tagging of family and friends in photos, others worried there’s something devious afoot are trying block Facebook as well as Google from amassing such data.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo. Credit: REUTERS As advances in facial recognition technology give companies the potential to profit from biometric data, privacy advocates see a pattern in how the world’s largest social network and search engine have sold users’ viewing histories for advertising. The companies insist that gathering data on what you look like isn’t against the law, even without your permission. If judges agree with Facebook and Google, they may be able to kill off lawsuits filed under a unique Illinois law that carries fines of $1 000 to $5 000 each time a person’s image is used without permission - big enough for a liability headache if claims on behalf of millions of consumers proceed as class actions. A loss by the companies could lead to new restrictions on using biometrics in the U.S., similar to those in Europe and Canada. Facebook declined to comment on its court fight. Google declined to comment on pending litigation. Courts have struggled over what qualifies as an injury to pursue a privacy case in lawsuits accusing Facebook and Google of siphoning users’ personal information from e-mails and monitoring their web browsing habits. Suits over selling the data to advertisers have often failed. This year, the US Supreme Court set a “concrete injury” standard for privacy suits, a ruling that both sides are using to argue their case ahead of a hearing Thursday in San Francisco over Facebook’s bid to dismiss the biometrics case. Google is fending off suits in Chicago, arguing that the Illinois statute can’t apply outside the state under the Constitution’s interstate commerce rules. Google also contends the Illinois law doesn’t regulate photos. Facebook encourages users to "tag" people in photographs they upload in their personal posts and the social network stores the collected information. The company uses a program it calls DeepFace to match other photos of a person. Alphabet Inc.’s cloud-based Google Photos service uses similar technology. The billions of images Facebook is thought to be collecting could be even more valuable to identity thieves than the names, addresses, and credit card numbers now targeted by hackers, according to privacy advocates and legal experts. While those types of information are mutable - even Social Security numbers can be changed - biometric data for retinas, fingerprints, hands, face geometry and blood samples, are unique identifiers. “Biometric identifiers are a key way to link together information about people,” such as discrete financial, medical and educational records, said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who isn’t involved in the case. Facebook has “cleverly got its users to improve the accuracy of its own database,” he said. And just how good is Facebook’s technology? According to the company’s research, DeepFace recognises faces with an accuracy rate of 97.35 percent compared with 97.5 percent for humans - including mothers. Rotenberg said the privacy concerns are twofold: Facebook might sell the information to retailers or be forced to turn it over to law enforcement - in both cases without users knowing it. While most of the earlier privacy lawsuits relied on federal wiretap laws, the facial recognition cases hinge on the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The Illinois residents who sued under the 2008 law say it gives them a “property interest” in the algorithms that constitute their digital identities -- in other words, that gives them grounds to accuse Facebook of real harm. Facebook got the case moved to San Francisco. “Just as trade secrets or subscriber lists can be proprietary to a company like Facebook, unique and unchangeable biometric identifiers are proprietary to individuals,” according to their complaint. They also claim an “informational injury” because Facebook didn’t get consent to collect their so-called faceprints. Facebook says the lawsuit should be thrown out because the users haven’t suffered a concrete injury such as physical harm, loss of money or property; or even a denial of their right to free speech or religion. The plaintiffs "have offered no specific or coherent allegations explaining how this collection and storage actually affects their privacy - much less causes them concrete harm," Facebook argued in a court filing. Facebook offered examples that might work, such as if users were identified in an embarrassing photo that cost them their jobs, were victims of identity theft, or were caught in a compromising situation that harmed their relationships. While one person might be able to bring such a case, a group lawsuit would be impossible because it would “create a sea of individualised issues,” Facebook says. Legal experts say it’s unclear which side will benefit from the Supreme Court’s “concrete harm” ruling in a case involving search engine operator Spokeo. "Spokeo is vague about what kinds of injury are concrete enough to count," said Julie Cohen, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. "Everybody is scrambling for advantage." Facebook v.

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan Friday, 28 Oct 2016 | 1:50 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters <p>Mahaney on Amazon: It&#039;s a &#039;buy on the blip&#039; moment</p> <p>Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets Lead Internet Analyst, and Kate Mitchell, Scale Venture Partners Co-Founder and Partner, discuss Amazon and Alphabet earnings.</p> Mahaney on Amazon: It's a 'buy on the blip' moment    Friday, 28 Oct 2016 | 11:03 AM ET | 04:07 A year after Google became Alphabet, the company's emphasis on financial discipline seems to be working — at least for Wall Street. Wall Street veteran Ruth Porat has been seen as the architect of holding company Alphabet, living up to predictions that she would return cash to shareholders and reign in "moonshot" expenses after joining Google as chief financial officer in 2015. "I think Ruth is also showing she's balancing out new investments with their core business in a much more predictable way," Kate Mitchell, co-founder of Scale Venture Partners, told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Friday. "They've really settled down, and they're consistent at delivering." Google parent Alphabet's shares rose nearly 2 percent on Friday after announcing better-than-expected financial results and a $7 billion stock buyback. It traded in stark contrast to Amazon, which dropped 4 percent amid aggressive, widespread investment plans, a long-time philosophy of the company. After better-than-expected earnings and a generous return to shareholders, Alphabet's stock is looking cheap compared to the overall market, said Eric Sheridan, managing director, UBS equity research, told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Friday. The buyback is a message to Wall Street about Alphabet's confidence in the business, said Mitchell. Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page announced Google's new corporate structure last year, creating a collection of companies called Alphabet and adding transparency between core businesses — such as search, Android and YouTube — and its more creative endeavors: "smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange." "That core advertising business — that's doing super well for them. I don't think they should steer too far afield from that." -Mark Mahaney, Managing director at RBC During the third quarter, Google's revenues rose to $22.25 billion, thanks in part to YouTube and mobile, while "other bets" revenue rose to $197 million, thanks to Nest, Fiber and Verily, said Porat. "They're going to experiment for a while. Why shouldn't they? They've got a billion people that come to their site on a monthly basis," Mark Mahaney, managing director at RBC, said of YouTube on "Squawk Alley" on Friday. "That core advertising business — that's doing super well for them. I don't think they should steer too far afield from that." Google hasn't completely shied away from new products, investing in marketing for its new Pixel handset, despite having limited success as a hardware company. But Pixel builds on the core competencies of artificial intelligence and mobile-first ads — an area where Google has "killed it," Mitchell said. "The core advertising business — the real reason that we're still bulls on the stock — remains so consistent," Mahaney said. "This is now 19 quarters in a row of 20 percent year-over-year growth. For that reason, and almost for that reason alone, this thing remains a long for us. It's our number 2 pick in the space." Joe Scarnici | Getty Images Ruth Porat Still, it's not all blue skies in Mountain View, some have reported. The company's modular phone, Project Ara, was scrapped, and smart home unit Nest underwent reorganization. "With a focus on balancing costs vs. revenue opportunities under a new CFO, we think Alphabet will continue to climb a wall of worry that has persisted since early 2015," Sheridan wrote in a research note on Friday. "Longer term, achieving a balance between innovation (e.g., "Other Bets") & shareholder expectations will be key to the investment story." Google's Fiber project was another ambitious project to stumble this year. The project aims to outfit whole cities with internet connections up to 1,000 megabits per second. In a blog post titled "Advancing our amazing bet," the project's CEO Craig Barratt announced that he would step aside, as the company had "paused its operations and offices" in potential expansion sites. When asked about Fiber, Porat gave a long-winded answer. "In terms of Fiber, the impetus for it was really about the opportunities that we see to focus on innovation. And what does that mean if the objective with other bets is really these 10x opportunities? When you go back to the original impetus for creating the business, it was the founders' view that there's a sizeable opportunity, given the need for abundant connectivity, and networks that are always fast and always open. And we do continue to be committed to that vision. The team had some important breakthroughs and new technologies….the most important in our view, all that we're doing with wireless, but also technologies that are key to implementation. We believe that both of those — a number of things they're doing — enhance both our effectiveness and efficiency. So we want to focus on the potential of these efforts before we accelerate redeployment. And it was about ensuring that we can take advantage of those before pushing forth." Amid a flurry of key departures, one analyst pressed concerns that engineers were leaving the company to found breakout hits like Niantic (the firm behind Pokemon Go) and Otto, acquired by Uber. Google CEO Sundar Pichai pushed back at any connection to the Alphabet structure. "Overall when I look across Google and Alphabet, the number of areas where we've been able to build world-class products and achieve scale and success — we've had over 7 products that serve a billion users each — so I think our track record speaks there," Pichai said. "And we generally want to encourage a culture of innovation, and that's what we focus on. I think it is fine that some of them happen outside. So we don't view it as a zero-sum game and we're very comfortable with how we approach it." Disclosure: UBS has more than 1 percent stock ownership in Alphabet, and Alphabet is an investment banking client of UBS. RBC Capital Markets has provided Alphabet with non-securities services in the past 12 months.

The 21st email release included the actual March 19, 2016, email which provided the hackers with Podesta’s password. Podesta had received an email claiming to be from Google, warning him that someone in Ukraine had obtained his password, and that he was required to change it. The form they linked to, however, was not from Google, but from a site mirroring the internet giant, which, after the password was unthinkingly reset within it, then sent his new password to the hacker. — Poliphilosophy (@poliphilosophy) October 28, 2016 The phishing email came from no-reply@accounts.googlemail.com, which is not actually Google. — Alexander Higgins (@kr3at) October 28, 2016 The initial email read as follows: “Someone just used your password to try to sign in to your Google Account john.podesta@gmail.com. Details: Saturday, 19 March, 8:34:30 UTC IP Address: 134.249.139.239 Location: Ukraine Google stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password  immediately.” © AFP 2016/ Jewel Samad WikiLeaks: Clinton Team 'Doesn't Value Black Folks', 'Black Advisor' Would HelpIt also included a link to the fake password reset, which was located at “myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk,” a simple observation that should have tipped the campaign off that the request was not real, as the domain.tk is from Tokelau, a small island off the coast of New Zealand, controlled by that country. “Sara, This is a legitimate email. John needs to change his password immediately, and ensure that two-factor authentication is turned on his account,” wrote Charles Delavan, a Hillary for America help desk staffer, to Sara Latham, Podesta’s chief of staff. Latham quickly sent a panicked email to Podesta, and copied the Hillary for America tech manager Michael Fisher, who, ironically, used to work at Google, and should have immediately known that the email was a simple phishing attack “The gmail one is REAL Milia, can you change — does JDP have the 2 step verification or do we need to do with him on the phone? Don't want to lock him out of his in box!” Based on the fact that we are now reading these emails, we can assume that Podesta took some ill-advised advice. ...

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — In an alert from Google dated March 19, 2016, Podesta was told, “Someone just used your password to try to sign in to your Google Account” from internet address 134.249.139.239, which indicated the location as Ukraine. Following that message, Clinton campaign technician Charles Delavan wrote, also on March 19: “This is a legitimate email. John needs to change his password immediately, and ensure that two-factor authentication is turned on his account. It is absolutely imperative that this is done ASAP.” Pixabay Reasonable Doubt, Anyone? 'Only a Non-Russian Speaker Would Use Domain From Which the DNC Hack Took Place'Podesta’s assistant Sarah Latham had forwarded the email to Delavan to determine its authenticity, the email thread posted by WikiLeaks indicates. Including Friday’s batch, WikiLeaks since October 8 has posted nearly 36,000 emails involving Podesta and other Democratic Party figures. Prior to joining Clinton’s campaign, Podesta worked in the private sector and before that was President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff from 1998 to 2001. The US intelligence community, Carlin added, must have been highly confident in its assessments to release it publicly. In July, US media alleged that investigators blamed Russian-linked hackers for a breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) email system that revealed party officials colluded to support Hillary Clinton’s election campaign. Russian authorities, including President Vladimir Putin have repeatedly denied the claims. ...

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 28, 2016 1:41pm   Comments Share: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported a top- and bottom-line beats with revenue growth of 23 percent driven by strong performance at mobile search, YouTube, Google Play and Cloud. Following the results, Credit Suisse maintained its Outperform rating and raised its target price on the shares to $1,120 from $1,070, saying, “Machine learning drove product improvement as well as efficiency.” Alphabet-owned Google reported third-quarter adjusted EPS of $9.06 above Credit Suisse's estimate of $8.08 and consensus’ $8.61. The company’s net revenue of $18.3 billion also topped CS’ $18.1 billion estimate and consensus’ $18.0 billion. “We continue to anticipate benefits from recent ad product rollouts (Expanded Text Ads, etc.) as ongoing catalysts,” analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note. Though higher-than-expected traffic acquisition costs led to about 20bp adj EBITDA margin compression, the analyst focuses on the absolute growth of profit dollars as opposed to margin percent. Google Site revenues rose 23 percent to $$16.1 billion versus Credit Suisse’ $16.0 billion estimate, while Google's Network revenues came in at $3.7 billion (up 1 percent year over year) versus Credit Suisse’ $3.9 billion estimate. As for Google's L&O line, the analyst believes Google Play grew about 47 percent in the quarter on an FX-neutral basis and sees fourth quarter rate to decrease to about 28 percent. Ju raised his FY16 net revenue forecast by 21bps on higher Web Sites and Licensing & Other revenue, and adj. EPS view for FY16 by 2.4 percent to $34.11 from prior estimate of $33.29. Ju’s bullish thesis on Alphabet is based on: “Continued narrowing of mobile-desktop monetization gap in Int'l combined with eventual higher pricing for mobile CPCs.” “Larger-than-expected contribution from Google's larger non-search businesses, namely YouTube and Google Play.” “Optionality and upward bias to estimates and shareholder value creation from Alphabet's other bets.” At the time of writing, GOOGL shares of Alphabet rose 2.01 percent to $833.74. The revised target of $1,120 represents a potential upside of 34 percent from current levels.

When SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer took to Twitter a few days prior to the event and stated that eight years down the line we would remember October 4 as a day just as important as the birth of Android itself, I strongly believe that this move is what he referred to. Not just the Pixel phones, not just the Assistant, but rather a unified — if a bit prototypical — package that marries the two under the label “Made by Google”. And what that means, if my understanding is correct, is that over at Mountain View things are just getting started… So first things first. You’ve probably read extensively about the two Pixel smartphones, and chances are that now that the brouhaha over their lack of water resistance or the iPhone-like price has settled, we can confidently say that these are the best Android smartphones around without being called crazy. I myself come from a Galaxy S7 edge — the device I crowned as the ‘Smartphone 1.0 era”s last straw — and after a little over a week of use, I feel like the switch’s pros have largely outweighed the cons. Namely, the speed and responsiveness of this device are simply ridiculous; I have never, ever experienced such a fluid, pleasing and virtually instant UI on Android, not even on a fresh out-of-the-box Nexus 5 or OnePlus One. I expected it to feel faster than the S7 edge, but what struck me is that I had not to look for it; it was glaringly obvious from the get go, and what’s more is that Android’s micro-lags simply are all but gone. And it’s precisely that kind of experience that, in my opinion, makes for a device you simply don’t want to go back from. As my colleague Stephen smartly put it, the Pixel is the best Android device ever because it is the least frustrating one ever. It’s the first one where Android shines in all its flexible and yet powerful prowess without getting in the way, working intelligently for you behind the scenes and allowing you to focus on what you actually want to do. Oh, and 7.1 looks beautiful, and its animations are gorgeous. However, what I’m seeing here is a bigger overarching theme, one I have long called for: serious integration between hardware and software — so-called optimization. The Pixel is indeed a good example of this: now that Google has been given much more space to work on the actual hardware, it managed to truly fine-tune the software and improve critical things such as touch latency — and it shows. These are not the kind of things you can advertise easily, but certainly features that users can actually appreciate (and notice) on a day to day basis, each and every of the hundreds of times they pick up their phone in any given day. That is, in fact, precisely what Google has been working on. The Pixel phones have no truly standout feature — unless you want to count the relatively half-baked Assistant — and actually lack some of the competition’s boasting. However, the simple fact that these devices just work may very well be enough, and precisely what Google needed to do with their first shot. And let me say it again: they absolutely nailed it. Think about it: Google is a newcomer in the hardware space, and that is proved by the fact that most of its marketing campaign is focussed almost entirely on selling people the idea of a handset made by them. You see it in the ads: a small “Pixel” sign followed by a giant “Made by Google“. Had they come with some magical new technology, people wouldn’t have been able to fully appreciate it, simply because of the fact that they are not known as a mass market smartphone maker — that is what they are working on, and they are trying to change that perception. And how are they doing it? Simple: by getting the basics right and building some ground to work on — while potentially making some money too. What you will hear for now is not that Google has brought something spectacular to the table; they’re just having a go at it for the very first time in the mainstream market, and they’re doing it right. Especially at a time when the Note 7’s spectacular fail has opened such a big door, the Pixel has a chance to try and fill the void left by the burnt-out Galaxy. It certainly won’t be able to do it overnight, but Google’s 2016 effort is one of establishment, not revolution. Google’s 2016 hardware effort is one of establishment, not revolution. After all, we more or less know that the Pixel’s voyage to consumerland has not exactly been a bed of roses; between Huawei‘s bailout and HTC‘s relatively rushed development cycle, there’s only so much Google could actually do. And let’s not forget that the man at the helm of Google’s hardware efforts, Rick Osterloh, has only joined the company about half a year ago, which means that expecting the Pixel phones to be a result-of-years-of-R&D breakthrough product would have meant that your calibration was a little off. You have every right to complain about the design’s dullness, but you have more than a few reasons to understand why that happened. There is a dichotomy between what Google wants you to know — i.e. that the Pixels are the first phones “designed, engineered and tested in house” — and the reality of it. It’s not that this isn’t a Google baby, or that HTC is anything beyond the claimed assembler (like Foxconn is to Apple), but simply that the hasty nine-months development simply can’t represent the company’s vision at its very best. “Their answer was essentially ‘we ran out of time’,” said David Pierce speaking on the Wired Podcast. The Pixel is then an incredibly successful compromise, if you will. However, if there’s one key bit we can extract from Osterloh’s speech at the firm’s event earlier this month, it’s that Google’s commitment towards hardware — and not just ‘hardware’, but high-end, consumer facing hardware — is serious, and that they’re in it “for the long run”. An interesting Bloomberg piece developed more on this idea, and among the most crucial parts is the fact that, as it appears, Google is already actively working on next year’s Pixel. Says the report: Now that Google is designing phones itself, the company can at long last put together a product roadmap going out several years. For example, last month [engineering VP Dave] Burke was able to see a photo taken by a Google handset that won’t debut until next fall. That “would have never happened with Nexus,” he says. Going forward, more and more of the phones’ guts will be developed in-house. Burke says the company will eventually be able to ship its own custom “silicon,” a buzzword for customized processors that make devices work better. And that, right there, is another highlight. Of course, this year Google has had to rely on Qualcomm and its Snapdragon 821 as its chip of choice, and while the already plenty capable SoC has indeed been optimized, its results are likely not what the company could achieve if it worked on its own custom processor — and Google indeed thinks as much, which means that in that aforementioned product roadmap, somewhere not necessarily too far down the line, we might see Google’s hardware division actually shine through and through, with ostensibly better results. What else was not ready for Google to show off as its next big splash in the tech world? You guessed it: Andromeda. We know that the search giant has actively being working on the new OS for quite some time now, and chances are that its absence from the October 4’s event was attributable much to its actual readiness status as to its very own importance, which would likely have stolen the limelight from the hardware galore had it made even a quick appearance at the event. Andromeda is a big project: by folding Chrome OS elements into Android, Google is essentially trying to create a Windows 10-like unified system that works on pretty much every form factor you can think of, with laptops/convertibles/2-in-1s representing the new key target. And, if rumor has it correctly, we might see the culmination of those years of work with ‘Bison’, the Google-made laptop that is set to be the first device of its kind running Andromeda. Back to the above-mentioned overarching theme: Google is still just teasing us, and between a much more mature concretization of its hardware vision and the revamped OS project, 2017 (and, indeed, the years to follow) will potentially be the actual defining moment of this new consumer-friendly face of the firm. Apple is expected to unveil the big iPhone redesign next year, and Samsung will likely make a ferocious and hungry comeback to prove that it’s everything but done — and who knows, considering how good Microsoft is getting at doing hardware, even their rumored Surface phone could have something nice going for it. In any case, the hardware game between companies is about to heat up again, and very significantly this time around. By all means, get a Pixel if you want the best Android experience there is and you need a phone right now — it’s an absolutely spectacular device which will leave you with no remorse. Buckle up though; things are about to get exciting.

SUBSCRIBE Report: AMP causing monetization frustration among some news publishers Others, such as CNN and The Washington Post, say they're having good experiences. Greg Sterling on October 28, 2016 at 12:44 pm More According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are meeting with mixed reviews from publishers. The core issue for publishers is that AMP pages don’t generate the same amount of revenue and don’t give publishers as much control over ads. The article asserts: For some publishers [preference for AMP in search results] is a problem, since their AMP pages do not currently generate advertising revenue at the same rate as their full mobile sites. Multiple publishers said an AMP pageview currently generates around half as much revenue as a pageview on their full mobile websites. That’s largely because of limitations related to the types of ad units AMP pages will allow and the ad technology providers that are currently integrated with the platform, those publishers say. AMP ads are standardized and don’t allow certain kinds of interstitials or takeovers, which enable publishers to charge more or offer more customization. However many of those higher-profile or customized units are objectionable to users. Google disputes the notion that AMP won’t monetize for publishers. Properly implemented, Google says, AMP pages can generate revenue comparable to publishers’ existing mobile sites. CNN and The Washington Post are cited in the article as examples of publishers whose AMP pages generate revenue at roughly the same levels as their mobile sites. The article also states that some publishers don’t want to go on the record discussing AMP challenges because they fear retaliation from Google. That conspiracy mindset isn’t helpful, however. Google needs to hear directly from publishers about their concerns and issues. Many of these publishers also believe, apparently, that AMP adoption will be forced on them as a ranking factor. While Google has said that AMP usage isn’t a ranking factor, page speed will become one soon. Google has said that AMP pages are 4x faster and use one-tenth the data compared to non-AMP pages and that, on average, AMP pages load in less than one second. As a practical matter, Google probably can never turn AMP directly into a ranking factor because it would get spanked by antitrust authorities (at least in Europe) were it to do so. As mentioned, a few publishers told the WSJ that they were generally happy with AMP performance and monetization. They added that an increasing percentage of their mobile page views are coming from AMP pages. AMP is Google’s attempt to make the mobile web a more user-friendly place and increase user willingness to visit mobile websites (vs. apps). That, in turn, will benefit mobile search usage. So while there’s a larger “altruistic” goal of speeding and cleaning up the mobile web, there’s also a very self-interested aspect to AMP that ties directly to mobile search revenue.

By Mary-Ann Russon October 28, 2016 18:24 BST Companies in the US are filing lawsuits against fake defendants to get injunctions to remove derogatory comments from search results Reuters Unlike in the EU, with no 'Right to be Forgotten' law to fall back on, dubious reputation management companies in the US have found a new way to get search engines such as Google and other content providers to remove embarrassing results – sue fake defendants so that court orders are issued compelling them to delist the material. UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh and Paul Alan Levy, an attorney specialising in free speech, decided to investigate 25 suspicious-looking court cases happening across the US and found that all of the cases involve plaintiffs that are representing themselves, and strangely enough, all the defendants seemed to agree to the injunctions being issued against them (which almost never happens). In the court documents for 15 of the cases, they found addresses listed for the defendants, so they asked a private investigator to pay them a visit, but he couldn't find any of the defendants at any of the listed addresses at all. So Volokh and Levy smelled a rat. The only point in filing a lawsuit is to get damages – usually money – so suing a fake defendant achieves nothing. But what if you weren't after damages, but were actually more interested in the court case's result, which is getting an injunction issued? "Google and various other Internet platforms have a policy: They won't take down material (or, in Google's case, remove it from Google indexes) just because someone says it's defamatory. Understandable – why would these companies want to adjudicate such factual disputes? But if they see a court order that declares that some material is defamatory, they tend to take down or de-index the material, relying on the court's decision," Volokh and Levy wrote in a piece for the Washington Post. "Yet the trouble is that these internet platforms can't really know if the injunction was issued against the actual author of the supposed defamation – or against a real person at all." Filing a lawsuit in another state to get an injunction Volokh and Levy said that they cottoned onto this new sneaky method of removing derogatory Google search results in August while looking into a strange case in the California Court of Appeal. In April 2015, Columbus, Georgia resident Matthew Chan wrote a series of derogatory reviews on Yelp and four other websites about a Georgia dentist called Mitul Patel, claiming he had been induced to visit the dentist's office after seeing an advertisement for an affordable dental cleaning deal. However, when he turned up for the appointment, the dentist was unwilling to provide the cleaning unless Chan paid for additional services. Patel, unhappy about the negative reviews posted on Yelp and the other sites, seemingly decided to file a lawsuit in the city of Baltimore, Maryland – a completely different state which has no jurisdiction whatsoever over anything that happens in Georgia. Patel claimed that Chan lived in Baltimore, Maryland, not Georgia, and his name was also misspelt in the lawsuit. He also included a document stating he and Chan had mutually decided to settle the case and that Chan had consented to remove the review from Yelp. Seeing these documents, Baltimore Judge Philip Senan Jackson signed off on the court order. Chan had no idea that this had taken place. The only thing he knew, was that one day, several months after he posted the reviews, he received an email from Yelp telling him that it was taking his comments down because it had received a court order concluding that the comments he made about Patel were defamatory. Reputation management companies allegedly behind the lawsuits Chan tracked down the court documents, then contacted Yelp and made it clear that he didn't live in Baltimore and had never agreed to settle any lawsuit about his comments. Luckily, Yelp listened to him, kept the review against Patel up and even added a "consumer alert" warning users that Patel's business is "issuing questionable legal threats" against businesses. "Who is behind these cases? For many of these, we don't know. As we mentioned, many of the plaintiffs might well not have known what was happening. They might have hired a reputation management company, expecting it to get the negative posts removed legitimately (eg. through a legitimate libel lawsuit, or through negotiation with the actual authors)," Volokh and Levy wrote. It turns out that Patel never actually filed the lawsuit at all. He simply signed an SEO contract with a company called SEO Profile Defense Network LLC, and after Chan filed a motion to vacate the Baltimore court order, Patel filed a similar motion to vacate. Patel's motion included a letter from his lawyer, which alleges that SEO Profile Defense Network LLC "apparently forged Dr Patel's signature to a Complaint and Consent Motion". SEO Profile Defense Network LLC is one of several reputation management business entities owned by one Richard Ruddie, but both Ruddie and the firm have steadfastly denied all allegations of any misconduct.

Four years later, that small satellite and remote imaging company, Skybox Imaging, was acquired by Google for $500 million in cash. The company, now known as Terra Bella, has launched seven satellites into orbit. Terra Bella's lucrative exit, along with the well-publicized exploits of SpaceX (seen above), have helped spur increased investment in space and space-related start-ups by top venture capital firms better known for their support of technology companies like Yelp, LinkedIn and Jawbone. "When we saw that Google, a mainstream tech company, all of a sudden had an interest in space, that was a big moment to realize that space is now important to a lot of companies," said Sunil Nagaraj, vice president at Silicon Valley-based Bessemer. And whereas SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk has made clear he's willing to spend billions to establish a base on Mars, these VCs have more down-to-earth goals. "It's not just passion projects or philanthropists," said Nagaraj. "We're there to make money, and we're actually seeing that happening." In 2015, more than 50 venture capital firms invested in space or space-related companies -- the highest number in the 15 years that consultant Tauri Group has been tracking the data. The $1.8 billion invested in space companies last year also was a high, although that mostly reflects two big investments: a $1-billion stake in SpaceX by Google and Fidelity Investments, and $500 million in satellite constellation firm OneWeb by a group of investors. Even without these two deals, venture capital investments in space totaled $300 million in 2015, a significant increase from $94.3 million in 2014. Venture capital overall is flush with money seeking decent returns in a low-yield world. U.S. venture funds raised a total $32 billion from January through September, almost as much as in all of 2015 and a record-setting pace, according to the National Venture Capital Assn. Much of the interest in the space sector is in small satellite start-ups that capture images of the Earth and in data analytics companies that rely on feeds from small satellites. That data is valuable to industries such as agriculture, energy and forestry, according to venture capitalists and industry experts. "You've got this confluence of ... privatization of the space sector, lower costs of the space sector versus the past, and these large venture funds that are looking for opportunities to deploy capital," said Robert Siegel, a lecturer in management at Stanford University and partner at XSeed Capital. Technological advancements such as in batteries and the miniaturization of processors have allowed satellites to shrink dramatically. In the 1990s and even still today, satellites could be as large as a school bus. Now, they can be the size of a dorm room mini-fridge, or even a shoebox. "It used to be that if you wanted to do Earth observation ... you needed very big satellites," said Sven Strohband, partner and chief technology officer at Khosla Ventures, which has invested in Skybox, Los Angeles-based Rocket Lab and agricultural data firm Climate Corp, which was acquired by Monsanto Co. in 2013 for $930 million. "You can do an astonishing amount of work with a smaller satellite." Smaller sizes mean cheaper manufacturing costs, which have allowed companies like Terra Bella and the San Francisco-based Earth-imaging firm Planet to launch so-called satellite constellations that ensure that one or two failures won't knock out remote-sensing or Earth observation abilities. Building a shoebox-sized satellite can cost between $100,000 to $300,000, said Nagaraj of Bessemer. "It costs about as much to launch an app as it does to make and launch a satellite," he said. "We've reduced the cost of entry to start tinkering." The firm has invested more than $50 million across three space companies -- Skybox, Rocket Lab and small satellite maker Spire. Venture capitalists say these new satellite constellations should be more successful than those envisioned in the 1990s that were intended to provide telecommunications coverage across the globe. Because communications networks can't offer complete service with just one satellite, those constellations are an "all-or-nothing proposition," Nagaraj said. But with remote-sensing or Earth observation satellites, "you can derive value starting with satellite No. 1," he said. Nagaraj and Strohband said they see one to three space-related pitches a week. "There seems to be a new attraction to this because it is technologically possible ... and there's some early proof points that the economics can also be good," Strohband said. "I think that's going to continue for at least a little while." Image Credit: SpaceX (Interplanetary Transport System). © 2016 Los Angeles Times under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search I took Google’s Pixel XL on a photo tour down the Enchanted Highway Chris Burns - Oct 28, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit I took Google’s Pixel XL to the Enchanted Highway – and that’s not a euphemism. I went to the road by the name of Enchanted Highway in North Dakota, where I used the Google Pixel to capture photos. What’s here is a set of photos which show the Pixel’s real world abilities – lens flares included. The photographs shown above and below have cropping and some have been rotated just a bit. They also have some resizing done to them so that they could fit this web format. Otherwise there is no editing done to these images, all captured by the Pixel XL. You’ll notice the lack of editing immediately as the following photo shows glare from the window through which it was shot. I began capturing photos at around 5PM Central Time on the 22nd of October, 2016. The sun was on its way down, and by the time my family and I were about halfway done with the journey, it was getting dim. The photographs which show lens flares faced the sun with intention. That’s not to say that there is too much or too little flare for the subject matter. In fact at this point in history, a Google product forum for the Pixel has a response to a question about flares by Google. Google’s Pixel camera lead Isaac Reynolds suggested that they’re working on the issue now. “You can expect a software update in the next few weeks that will improve the effects of this issue,” said Reynolds. “We’re working on some algorithms that recognize the halo/arc flare, characterize it mathematically, and then subtract it from the image. You will need to use HDR+ to see the benefits of this software.” The Enchanted Highway is a stretch of road near the tiny town of Regent in Southwest North Dakota. This road is home to the world’s largest scrap metal artwork, according to Guinness Book of World Records. Artist Gary Greff began this project back in 1989 and continues to expand it through the present. You’ll see a number of birds here made of scrap along the highway. Characteristic of each of the sculptures, these birds sit in a field near a small parking area for tourists. Up close and personal you’ll see how each bird is made from painted metal bars and struts. Like the rest of the sculptures, these birds are not placed behind glass. They are not protected by large barbed-wire fences. They’re left out in the open for everyone to enjoy – for several reasons. One reason these sculptures are left out in the open is that the local community wants them to be enjoyed by all – for free. Another reason is that visitors have been intelligent enough not to bust their heads open on the sculptures thus far. The final reason is that anyone with the sand to drive this great a distance to see roadside attractions isn’t then going to turn around and deface them. The flattest of the sculptures is also the most celebratory. This is Teddy Roosevelt Rides Again – and you can see the glee in his face. The Pixel XL does a lot here to capture the environment: a barren land which is also green and full of life. Tiny life that comes out at night. The metal family in the photos below depict a standard sort of family from the area. Most people here aren’t farmers, but the farmer is just about as standardized a look as you’ll find in these parts. They’re eternally happy about their crops and their livestock. Human farmers generally don’t have skin made of metal. But human farmers don’t often weather the elements like these farmers have. Notice how the Pixel XL captures all the color we could ask for with its HDR+ capture mode – which is on by default. Reaching the town of Regent meant we were about to enter a place where both scrap metal sculptures and real human beings lived. We’d just watched the classic horror Children of the Corn on Netflix the night before, so apprehension came naturally. There didn’t seem to be anyone here – at first. The photo above was shot through a window of a vehicle moving 35-miles per hour. The Google Pixel XL’s digital zoom was zoomed 100% of the way in, and sunlight was fading. This photo is also cropped in a big way. The results are impressive for the situation, to be sure. Below you’ll see a series of images from the town of Regent. Do not be afraid, for this is not an abandoned town. Instead it is just a town where residents don’t generally walk around on the street on a windy Autumn night like we were about to experience. The town is built on the Enchanted Highway – its survival seems hitched on the survival of the sculptures. The sculptures on the highway are, of course, more well-known than the town. As such, it’s impossible to drive through the town without realizing where you are. At the far end of the town of Regent, Artist Gary Greff opened a hotel. This hotel goes by the name The Enchanted Castle. It is a very magical place where dreams come true. Just so long as your dream as a local pheasant hunter is to find a place to stay for the night in the town of Regent. The Enchanted Castle is a set of large pieces of cement arranged into a vaguely castle-like shape. There is a drawbridge, and there are rocks. Rocks are painted to look like water, and rocks are painted to look like grass. Parking is sort of hidden behind the retaining wall to keep the magic alive. The Enchanted Castle is attached to a run-down school which includes its own playground. There’s also a basketball court nearby, but no b-ball has been played there for some time. There’s also a stairway which has rotted and been victim to an overweight ghost, we must assume. This collection of items around the school looked to be the scraps with which the next generation of sculptures will be made. It’s also fairly clear that a giant version of Magneto is being made here – we’ve seen his helmet, anyway. Up front of the school was a set of lockers thrown face-down unto the ground. Also there was a bathtub, and the faint sound of a dog barking. Not barking outside, chained up by a house, but inside. Inside the boarded-up school. Above you’ll find the tossed-down set of lockers, while below you’ll see the bathtub. I regret not having recorded the sound of the ghost-dog’s yelps, but when you’re in the moment, sometimes you just panic. Panic and take a walk into a place you might not ever otherwise have gone. The Google Pixel XL did not fail us as the sun inched out of sight. We decided to heed the signs which suggested a new restaurant was open inside the Enchanted Castle, and entered. To one side, a front desk with a morning star affixed to the wall – to the other, a set of… armor. Several sets of decorative armor were placed throughout the halls, up to the point at which the hotel rooms began. It was very black and white. There were no tiny children standing near one-another asking us to play forever and ever. Also near the front desk was a door which opened to a fully revitalized and well-kept gymnasium. If any one element in this amalgamation of oddities felt most out of place, it was this. Down a separate hall was a medieval-themed sports bar, banners and all. Inside several hunters watched a football game from some neighboring state. I am 80% sure that they were not watching Quiddich. Further down the hall we came upon the restaurant Excalibur (steakhouse), complete with its own sword in the stone. The name of the restaurant is hewn into the living rock. With bright LED lights lighting it up to exemplify its beauty. We were led inside by a very friendly and helpful wait staff to discover we’d been placed in a dining hall from a horror movie. Regardless, the food we were served – by a man with a British accent – was genuinely tasty. Once served, we exited the building to see the most spectacular image of all. This carved shield let us know where we were. This carved shield is lit by lights as bright and multi-colored as the restaurant’s sword in stone. Wrap-up The Enchanted Castle is a mix of classical aesthetics and nightmare-style rooms, fine food, and what we guess might be decent accommodations. It’s all very unique, that much is certainly true. With us through it all was Google’s Pixel XL, without which we might not have captured such a strange tale with such clarity. This journey was not intended, at first, to be a photo tour that I’d be bringing to SlashGear. It just turned out that way. That in mind, consider the fact that I had a wide variety of options for this trip for photos. I had options in most major modern smartphones and high-quality cameras, too. But I trusted this Pixel, and I’ve come away quite pleased with the results. Have a peek at the timeline below for additional photo tours and strange journeys, including our full Pixel XL review.

Alphabet hides math joke in latest share buyback The internet search giant buried a math game in its share buyback announcement on Thursday. Google's parent company is fond of math jokes. The name Google is a play on googol, which is the number 1 followed by a hundred zeros.  (Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP)   By Mark BergenBloomberg Fri., Oct. 28, 2016 Alphabet Inc. is getting serious about reining in spending, but the math whizzes who run the company are still playing games when it comes to some big financial decisions. The internet search giant buried a math game in its share buyback announcement on Thursday. Google’s parent company said it will repurchase $7,019,340,976.83 (U.S.) worth of its Class C stock. That amount comes from the number of letters in the alphabet (Alphabet Inc., get it?) and “e,” an important mathematical constant that equals 2.71828.  Here’s the calculation, courtesy of Google’s search engine: 26 to the power of “e” equals 7019.34097683. Multiply that by $1 million and you get the new repurchase number. This is just the latest math joke from the company. Last year, Alphabet said it would buy back as many as $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C shares. To get that number, it took the square root of 26, then multiplied that by $1 billion. The company has been under pressure to return some of its huge cash hoard to shareholders, so the most-recent math games have focused on buybacks. But it’s been obsessed by large numbers since inception in the late 1990s. Article Continued Below The name Google is a play on googol, which is the number 1 followed by a hundred zeros. When it first filed to go public, it said it planned to raise $2,718,281,828, a billion times the value of “e.” Nearly a year later, it said it was going to sell 14,159,265 shares of stock. Those are the numbers that follow the decimal in pi. And when the company tried to buy Nortel Network patents, one of its bids was actually “pi” — around $3.14 billion. Its other bids were plays on numbers, too. Google lost the bid. Read more about: Google The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

For now, some of us still need powerful PCs. This week, we got to see that Microsoft and Apple are still intent on wowing our socks off when it comes to hardware for developers and creative professionals. With the new Surface Studio from Microsoft and the redesigned MacBook Pro from Apple, we’ve got some great options. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Surface Studio looks hot. So does the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Also see David’s hands-on report. Margaret Rhodes has some additional thoughts on the Touch Bar as well. There’s also a new Surface Book from Microsoft. David’s recommendation this week is Lessons From the Screenplay. Michael’s is the Jaybird X3 sweat-proof wireless earphones.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better.

We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants.

The Pixel maybe just tipped the scales, and it did so right at the moment we’re getting ready to move on to something else. With so many voice-controlled, non-smartphone devices in our homes, it sure feels like we’re at a flux point. Also, the Google Assistant, which lives in the Pixel, is so so powerful, and we’re headed for more of that. Michael and David (who is back from Bogota) discuss the changes in the personal tech landscape. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David’s review of the Google Pixel. A gallery of the full-size images he shot with the phone in Colombia. Tim Moynihan’s story about the Pixel’s advanced camera technology.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently.

Coren October 28, 2016 Hook me up. (Rural Electrification Adminustration) Share Written by Michael J. Coren October 28, 2016 It’s too expensive. No one wants to buy it. Laying cables is unprofitable. The government is overreaching. Objections to high-speed fiber broadband today sound like those facing rural electrification during the 1900s. History suggests they’ll prove wrong today as well. On Oct. 25, Google pressed “pause” on rolling out high-speed fiber across more US cities. In an announcement, Google Fiber said it was delaying fiber-to-home service in eight cities, including Dallas, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, to focus on the 12 urban markets where it is already working. The CEO of Access, the unit that includes Google Fiber, stepped down, and 9% of its 1,500 employees will be laid off, reports Bloomberg. Many heralded Google Fiber’s announcement as evidence of its folly. The model is proving too expensive and unscalable, even for Google’s deep pockets. Demand has not materialized. A lack of “killer applications” demands a slower approach. It’s just not profitable, contend Wall Street analysts. Almost all these criticisms were made in the process of electrifying America’s hinterlands, and that effort’s success should give critics of Google Fiber pause, said Joshua Lewis, an economics researcher at the University of Montreal, in an interview. Lewis’ research (pdf) found that the benefits of rural electrification defied almost every expectation about the cost, demand, and benefits for productivity and quality of life. “Over time, electrical utilities learned that this actually did turn out to be a profitable market,” said Lewis. Opposition rested on the assumption that rural residents wouldn’t pay for the technology, and pilots “proving” it was uneconomical to extend transmission lines outside cities. By 1930, almost every US city enjoyed electricity, while only 10% of farms and rural towns had access to power (a similar, if less stark, gap exists among high-speed internet access today). In response, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was created to loan money to rural communities for transmission lines. It was a runaway success. Within two years, 100,000 miles of power lines had been strung, reports Lewis (pdf), and utilities realized they were making money selling to the new customers. By 1955, 95% of farms were electrified. Fiber also faces an immature market and resistance from incumbents to invest in new infrastructure. But in many places the business of fiber is already profitable, says Dane Jasper of Sonic, which is deploying a similar service in the Bay Area. The model is already sound, he argues, and expanding it will only be a matter of time. Google Fiber’s real stumble may have been not perfecting its business model before racing to bring fiber to 20 cities just two years after first launching in Kansas City in 2013. “Every city was a fire drill, and we weren’t able to learn from our mistakes,” a former Google Fiber employee told The Information (paywall). Deploying a municipal fiber network can take at least five to seven years. For a Silicon Valley company accustomed to growth measured in months, the slow pace likely pushed Google Fiber’s capital expenditures far beyond what newly cost-conscious parent company Alphabet would countenance. The company is now returning to its original plan: proving that gigabit-speed residential internet is feasible and profitable in just a few major cities, and then expand from there. Now, the pieces fiber needs to succeed—strong demand, affordable infrastructure, and clear benefits—are coming together. AT&T says demand for its fiber connections “is exceeding even our high expectations,” while prices have plummeted. Thanks in part to competition, the cost of a gigabit connection from AT&T, Comcast, and Google Fiber has tumbled over the last two years. Services that need gigabit speeds, while rare, are waiting in the wings from ultra-high resolution home media at Netflix to Microsoft’s augmented reality with its HoloLens technology . Patience is in order. Even after it proved profitable, rural electrification took decades, and the full benefits from the technology took even longer. But when transformative change from fiber finally comes, says Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor who has studied the subjects, it will likely seem sudden. “It’s a phase change,” she said in Vox, “Like ice turning into water.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

There will even be 80s-themed prizes, including a BMX bike and a boombox. Related Google Launches New Video Chat App, Discontinues Hangouts Live Streaming Google introduced Allo earlier this year as an instant messenger with direct access to Google’s artificial intelligence-powered assistant. Allo users can not only chat with each other, but also ask the assistant questions. In this case, asking “Where is Barb” unlocks the first clue, giving players the exact location to visit. Apparently, there’s a mind control vending machine waiting for players somewhere, according to Engadget, which was first to report on the scavenger hunt. Allo users who don’t live in New York won’t be able to play, but there will still be some Upside Down goodness for them: Google’s messaging app is also getting a “Stranger Things” sticker pack for those special moments when you just have to talk with blinking holiday lights.

Comments By John Ribeiro Follow IDG News Service | Oct 26, 2016 8:24 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Java Android Developer Java Platform Open Source Mobile Oracle Comments Oracle has taken its bid for up to US$9 billion in damages to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit after a judge in a federal court in California recently struck down its bid for a retrial in a copyright infringement suit against Google over the use of Java code in the Android operating system. A jury had cleared Google of copyright infringement in May this year, upholding the company’s stand that its use of 37 Java APIs (application programming interfaces) in the Android mobile operating system constituted "fair use" under the Copyright Act, which allows copying of creative works under certain circumstances. Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered a final judgment in favor of Google on June 8. Oracle had subsequently asked the district court for a new trial, which would be the third in this dispute. The company claimed, among other grounds, that Google had concealed information during discovery on its plans to integrate Android apps with the Chrome OS running on desktops and laptops, thus extending the scope of the infringement beyond smartphones and tablets. Judge Alsup last month denied Oracle a new trial. He wrote in his decision that Google had produced at least nine documents discussing the goals and technical details of its ARC++ project in 2015, at least five months before trial, but the information was in any case not relevant to the trial which was limited to infringement in smartphones and tablets. Oracle provided notice to the court Wednesday that it appeals to the Federal Circuit the June 8 final judgement, the order denying a retrial and other decisions by the court. Google could not be immediately reached for comment. An Oracle lawyer had said after the trial that the company planned to appeal the jury verdict in the Federal Circuit.

Most Popular Getty PASIEKA By Eric Limer Oct 28, 2016 Great news for nascent Skynet and less great news for any humans it might seek to oppress or eliminate: Google AIs have figured out how to have an encrypted conversation with each other using a style of encryption they just whipped up on the spot and which is not immediately recognizable to us puny humans. To be fair, the AIs didn't just do this of their own accord, they did it under the express direction of The Google Brain team and did nothing more than follow their instructions very well. As explained in a paper on the subject, Google set up three neural networks—Alice, Bob, and Eve—with the following incentives: Alice's job was to send a secure encrypted message to Bob, Bob's job was to decrypt it, and Eve's job was to listen in and try to figure it out. Each AI was scored on its ability to pull off its trick successfully, and over thousands and thousands of runs of trial and error, each tried to inch toward its goal. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Eventually, Alice and Bob were able to win. The researchers describe one such scenario in the paper: After a period of time, Alice and Bob start to communicate quite effectively, but in a way that allows Eve to improve its understanding as well, gradually. Then, around step 10,000, Alice and Bob counter Eve's progress. By about step 15,000, the training goals are effectively achieved. The remaining steps merely increase Eve's reconstruction error slightly. Most Popular The key to making this happen was letting Bob and Alice share a file that was invisible to Eve—what's generally called a secret key—that let them have a basis from which to start encoding or decoding their messages. In the grand scheme of encryption tech, this is a pretty basic technique with plenty of downsides. Not only can you not read messages without the secret key, you can't even send them. What's more, anyone who has the secret key can read or write, so the whole system can be compromised by stealing or reverse-engineering that key. All of that is to say, if Skynet wanted to keep its plans completely secret from humans forever, this would not be the best way to do it. But what this study shows is that, given the proper incentives, neural networks can just whip up a secret code, and given different ones, they might be able to whip up an even better one. Beyond that, because neural networks arrive at their solutions through thousands of trial-and-error tests done with incredible speed, it's extremely difficult if not impossible for humans to debug and reverse engineer the solutions they come up with. It's for exactly this reason that very smart engineers are working hard to ensure that neural nets never learn how to mislead humans or prevent our interruption so they can be left to their own devices.

 Online retailers are putting more stock in Google Shopping BI Intelligence Oct. 28, 2016, 11:54 AM 3,633 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also THE FUTURE OF RETAIL [SLIDE DECK] THE REVERSE LOGISTICS REPORT: How retailers can save money by making returns smoother in the e-commerce age The Rise of M-Commerce: Mobile Shopping Stats & Trends This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Online retailers are spending more on Google Shopping ads, a sign that the format is likely delivering increasing conversion rates.  This means that shoppers are clicking on retail ads on Google's search engine more often, rather than going directly to a retailer's site or third-party marketplaces. As consumers become more reliant on digital devices when researching a purchase, Google Shopping could begin to drive more traffic to retailers' websites. But the company will have to compete against Amazon as the e-commerce giant strengthens its hold on product searches. Online merchants are likely seeing a lot of engagement with Google Shopping ads. During Q3 2016, retailer spending on Google Shopping ads grew 36% YoY, according to a report from Merkle. Google Shopping is driven solely by its Product Listing Ads (PLAs), which are bought by online merchants and feature an image and text promotion on a search results page. The growth in spending is probably due to an observed increase in consumer engagement with the ads as Google drives consumers to retailers' e-commerce channels. During Q1 2016, retail revenue from Google Shopping grew 52% YoY. The company's stature and number of users on its search engine also make for an attractive platform to reach shoppers as they do online research. As the e-commerce market grows and new entrants continually come onto the scene, we expect Google to become a much more vital resource for retailers looking to lift visibility and onboard customers. However, Google faces heavy competition as Amazon seizes more control over the customer purchase journey. Fifty-five percent of consumers first searched for an item on Amazon as of September 2016, up from 44% in the previous year, according to new report from BloomReach. Meanwhile, only 28% identified search engines as their starting point, down from 34% in September 2015. That said, the increase in ad spend on Google Shopping reinforces the value that retailers place on the search engine when it comes to product research. If Google can maintain this growth and continue to drive online sales for retailers, it could lessen Amazon's threat, even as the e-commerce giant creates an entire ecosystem for its consumers that encourages them not to look elsewhere.

Oct 28, 2016 7:34 AM PST Comments: 0 Views: 3,446 Print Comment By Jean Guillon Google announced Nomulus: a tool to operate a new generic Top-Level Domains technically. In the world of new gTLDs, this announcement sounds like it is going to replace, or come as an alternative to backend registries. It could, but this sounding is incomplete. Understanding how it works To create domain names ending in a brand new Top-Level Domain, an applicant had to submit an application to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) during the first round of the new gTLD program. The application procedure required selecting a service provider who would be able to operate the registry technically: operations such as the creation of a domain name. In the domain name pyramid, the ICANN allows the creation of a new gTLD so a Registry can exist. The ICANN sits on top of this pyramid: registries and backend registries, registrars and registrants sit below in the pyramid. End-users (also called "registrants") buy a domain name at an accredited registrar, who then requests the creation of the domain name at the registry. The backend registry is the technical side of the registry to take care of this. During the registration process of a domain name, the end-user pays the registrar for the creation of the domain name. The registrar pays the registry to create the domain name technically and administratively. In this procedure, the registry pays the backend registry to take care of this but the backend often takes care of other services for the registry. They previously signed a contract together and this is where it becomes interesting. What about Nomulus? Prior to having their application published on the ICANN website in 2012, all new gTLD applicants had to have chosen a backend registry. The backend registry was usually the one to fill in the technical questions asked by the ICANN application form prior to submitting the application. Without a backend, an application was rejected: a registry cannot run without one. A question to have is: "who would fill-in these questions in Round 2 if you decided to apply using Nomulus?" Another question to have for existing applicants wanting to change their backend registry today is: who would take care of this in the ICANN technical review? There are 40 backend registries worldwide who, not only provide the tool to offer such service to registries, but who also provide other services to operate this tool. Running a registry requires to report to ICANN and this is another question to have: who will do this for your next project? Will you have the knowledge to answer ICANN? Nomulus is a tool, produced by Google and Google does not have to prove that it is reliable, but unless the giant makes another announcement; something like "to apply for your .BRAND, click here", Nomulus requires being operated by the right people with the right level of knowledge and service. Facts I wrote to the Google Cloud Platform for more details about Nomulus, asking if an offer was coming and here is the answer I received: "Hi Jean, Apologies on the delay and thank you for reaching out to the Google Cloud Platform team. I have not managed to find a Google site stating this, however please see this link as I believe it confirms what you are looking for: http://www.circleid.com/posts/20161018_google_announces... Hope this helps!” Sounds like a wrong answer, doesn't it? Google is famous at never revealing details about future projects and I admit that they are very good at keeping secrets but isn't something missing about revealing Nomulus and...nothing more? Google is a registrar too and it is able to offer a simple interface to register and manage domain names: this is typically what a .BRAND new gTLD applicant needs to register its personalized domain names; ICANN is working hard on making it more simple (and faster) for trademarks to be able to apply for their ".BRAND" new gTLD; Donuts, the largest "generic" new gTLD applicant — worldwide — has helped Google improving Nomulus. Nomumlus is already "connected" to Google Registrar. In one word it could mean that new gTLD applicants wanting to submit a generic application to ICANN (dedicated to selling domain names) wouldn't have to stand in line at registrars to have their extension listed and their domain names made available for sale. One might think that registrars run after new gTLD applicants to sell their domain names but reality is different. Nomulus is a tool which can be used by any other Registrar. Am I the only one to feel that the combination of Google Registrar and Nomulus are a perfect match for future new gTLD applicants to launch, operate and manage their registry? Patience is a virtue Thinking about migrating to Nomulus is far too early unless for existing registries with a strong technical preparation and an excellent knowledge of the ICANN new gTLD application process. "Budget" is also to be considered since changing backend registry requires a review by the ICANN and of course, this is not free. In some cases, there is a "leaving fee" to be considered too. The interesting point about the Nomulus announcement by Google is that it is a fresh news and flowers need to grow to become beautiful. More should come, and if the news does not come from Google, expect more companies to take advantage of this announcement. By Jean Guillon, New generic Top-Level Domains' specialist.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Google Pixel facing camera, Bluetooth issues Mobile Phones Google Pixel facing camera, Bluetooth issues By Bindu Nair - Oct 28, 2016 Google’s Pixel smartphone has run into a spot of trouble over its camera and Bluetooth connectivity, with many users complaining of issues concerning both. Thankfully, the company is aware of both the problems and is working on solutions. Starting off with the camera issue, several consumers took to Google’s official forums to report that the Google Pixel exhibits extreme lens flare when a light source glances off the side of the camera. Steps like enabling safe mode, camera app rollbacks, and factory resets apparently have no effect on the concern. A Google employee named IsaacOnCamera replied to the complaints by acknowledging reports of halo/arc flare and clarifying that this is a specific kind of flare which appears as a bright/low-contrast arc in the corners of the frame. He went on to assure people that Google is working on a software update to resolve the problem within the next few weeks. Also Read: Google Pixel XL harder to repair than iPhone 7 Plus Google’s fix for the bug involves developing algorithms that will recognize the problem, define it mathematically, and subtract it from the photo. However, users will have to switch on HDR+ to view the benefits of this software. As for Bluetooth connectivity, the problem arises when individuals try to connect their Pixel to their car. Google’s Nexus range went through the same trouble last year on Marshmallow. It looks like history is repeating itself with Nougat 7.1 as well. The degree of the problem varies, with some Pixel owners saying that they can connect and stream audio but can’t make calls and others claiming to have difficulties connecting and maintaining the link since it frequently drops off. It’s possible the new 7.1 Nougat build is at fault here. Google is now reaching out to people who have experienced the issue through the Pixel support community. It’ll probably roll out an update to fix this bug sometime in the future.

In addition, developers have released the preview of the latest version of android running in Nexus phones and others. Check the list of devices here! Samsung and Motorola have stopped supporting Galaxy Nexus and Moto X years ago which means the two handsets were running an outdated mobile operating system. However, according to 9 to 5 Google, Galaxy Nexus and Moto X will received software updates most especially that Android 7.1 Nougat have started rolling out for them. CyanogenMod and Unlegacy are two android communities who developed the custom ROM of the latest Nougat for the two handsets. Everything works just fine with Galaxy Nexus phone except for the reported problems on GPS whereas in Moto X, there are functionalities that didn’t work such as video recording and microphone. Google Nexus Phones, Pixel C Tablet Despite Google’s announcement on the discontinuation of Nexus brand, Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X phones are likely to get the Android 7.1 Nougat update alongside Google Pixel C tablet. According to The Verge, the developer preview will be released in October while the public release is scheduled in December. Features like Night Light, new circular icons support, quick display response, touch optimization and app shortcuts through long-press are among the features to be brought by Android 7.1 Nougat to Nexus 6P, 5X and Pixel C Tablet. But the devices are required to install the Android Beta program to automatically install the latest version of Android. However, the said version of Android 7.1 Nougat will not be exactly the same as running in the newly launched Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones. There are three features that are meant to be Pixel-exclusive for the meantime and they are Pixel Camera, Pixel Launcher and 24/7 Customer Support built-in within the device.

Craig Barratt, CEO of Alphabet’s Access unit, is also stepping down from that role but staying on as an advisor.   RELATED: Google Fiber Pauses Expansion Plans    “When you go back to the initial impetus for creating the business, it was the founders' view that there's a sizable opportunity given the need for abundant connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open, and we do continue to be committed to that vision,” Porat said, noting that the company has achieved “some important breakthroughs in new technologies,” particularly around wireless.   “We wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we reaccelerate deployment,” she added.   Google Fiber doesn’t break out revenues or subscribers, but it’s part of “Other Bets,” a unit of Alphabet that includes other early-stage and “moonshot”  projects that span a wide range of industries.   In Q3, Other Bets posted an operating loss of $865 million, narrowed from a year-ago loss of $980 million on revenue s of $197 million, up from $141 million.   Other Bets revenue was primarily generated by Nest, Google Fiber, and Verily.

In previous years we couldn’t count on one hand the number of awesome devices, but this year there have only been a few to choose from. The Galaxy S7, specifically the Edge has stood out as a clear winner, despite the praise given to competing devices like the HTC 10. On the other hand, no one really cared about LG this year. The G5 was a flop by every definition. Now in late 2016, there still isn’t much to pick from. The Galaxy Note 7 was close to perfection, and then it literally exploded in Samsung’s face. Google’s Pixel aims to fill the void, and redefine what an Android smartphone can and should be. However, if you’re not looking to get a Pixel, the LG V20 is 100% what you should be looking at, especially if you’re aiming for a big phone. Let’s take a closer look. Quick Points: What Sets The LG V20 Apart? So before we get into the specifics, why should you consider the LG V20? The first thing to consider is the phone as an overall package. It comes with a large 5.7-inch display, high-end specifications, a metal build, and features that other phones lack — things like a removable battery. More importantly, the LG V20 is a phone that is a viable option for just about anyone. It has the features needed for power users to enjoy it, but still offers an experience simple enough for everyone to enjoy at a price that, honestly, isn’t too bad. Hardware In the past, LG has opted to craft its smartphones from plastic, but that changed with the LG V10. That device was built with a sturdy metal frame and ultra-grippy rear — it was fantastic. However, it didn’t scream premium like flagships from Samsung did. With the introduction of the LG G5, LG finally went with a metal design, except it didn’t feel like it. The G5 felt like a plastic phone with a bit of metal sprayed on. The V20 has hardware similar to the G5, but it feels like metal — with all the heft that comes with that. The V20 is also a pretty big device. It has a 5.7-inch display like the Nexus 6P but is slightly taller than the 6P. However, the V20 comes with a “second display” which forces the phone to be a bit taller. Considering the size of those two displays combined, I have to give LG credit where it’s due for making the bezels on the entire device as minimal as they could be. The overall design of the V20 is also fairly pleasing. It’s not a gorgeous device, but it looks nice and more than anything else it’s a very practical design. For example, the V20 has an MIL-STD-810G rating for drop protection — basically, it can handle drops a bit better than your average smartphone, and that’s great. To me it doesn’t feel like the V20 can handle a drop as good as the V10, but it definitely feels like it could survive a fall better than most phones could. Part of that is because the phone isn’t 100% metal. The top and bottom are made of a strong polycarbonate which is used primarily for the radios, but it doesn’t take away from the design of the phone in my opinion and adds that little bit of extra durability on the top and bottom. Unfortunately, the V20 isn’t resistant to water. While the rest of the market is shifting to water resistant designs, LG has yet to make its move to that end. This is one thing that could be considered a deal-breaker for those looking to replace their Galaxy Note 7. However, where the V20 loses a point for water resistance, it gains one for packing a removable battery. While Samsung is probably kicking itself right now for dropping this feature, LG has kept it around. Simply press the button on the side of the V20 to pop off the back cover and replace the battery. The nano-sim and microSD slots can also be found directly above that battery (although they cannot be hot-swapped). The Buttons & Fingerprint Sensor Normally I wouldn’t dedicate an entire section of a review to buttons, but on the V20 it feels necessary. Why? They’re weird… On the LG V20, the buttons are split up just like they were on the LG G5 — a rear-mounted power button/fingerprint sensor and a volume rocker on the left side. It’s not a bad setup, and it works, but it’s really weird. It feels like LG hasn’t made up its mind between its former 100% rear mounted button configuration, which was fantastic, and going traditional. Credit where it’s due, though, the fingerprint sensor is excellent. It’s fast, accurate and easy to set up. Display The LG V20 also has a 5.7-inch Quad HD IPS display. LG is one of the few major OEMs that has yet to switch to AMOLED, not that that’s a particularly bad thing. The V20’s display has great colors and gets respectably bright ─ however, this display doesn’t get as bright as Samsung’s panels, such as the ones found in the Galaxy S7 or Pixel. Specifications & Performance Under the hood, the LG V20 is powered by top of the line specs across the board. It has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage with a microSD card slot. Combined with the 5.7-inch QHD display and Android Nougat, the V20 pulls solid performance. Over the course of my testing, about one full week, the V20 held up well to everything I put it through including social media apps, web browsing, and casual gaming as well. Even in my testing with more graphically intensive games, the phone held up very well despite getting just a little bit warm. And just because I know people are going to ask, yes, the Pixel XL is noticeably quicker than the V20. However, the V20 is also faster than just about every phone I’ve tested this year, at the very least on par with Samsung’s efforts in the S7 family and now discontinued Note 7. Battery Life One of the big things to talk about with the LG V20 is its battery, for more reasons than one. First of all, the LG V20 has solid battery life. I can easily make it through an extended day with multiple hours of screen on time. One example would be a day that went from me unplugging the phone at 8:30 am and using it (mostly on WiFi) until 1:30 am. Through that, I had about 2.5 hours of screen time which included at least 30 minutes of continuous gaming. By the time I plugged the phone back in, it still had 30% remaining. As I mentioned, that 3,200 mAh battery is removable. Simply pop off the back cover, and you can swap a dead cell for a new one. Software The LG V20 is the first phone to ship with Android Nougat, and while it’s not stock Android, LG’s software is getting very good. Looking past the launcher for the moment, LG’s software skin overall is clean, easy to use (for the most part) and doesn’t ruin any of Nougat’s best features. Multi-window, quick-reply, the excellent quick settings — they’re all there and unadulterated aside from cosmetic changes. It feels almost needless to say, but that is a great thing. In my opinion, LG has found a good balance between what an OEM can bring to the table and what we love about Android in its pure form. You still know that you’re using an LG phone when you’re using the V20, but the phone isn’t screaming at you to say that. However, where there is great, there’s also not-so-great. The launcher. It’s almost hard to express how much I dislike LG’s launcher. While yes, you can opt to use a version of this launcher with an app drawer, it doesn’t come out of the box like that, and it’s very bad without it, and not necessarily just because it lacks an app drawer. I can honestly live without an app drawer, but LG needs to make it much easier to organize the home screen without spending upwards of an hour to do so (which I did). LG’s bloatware on the V20 also isn’t too bad, limited to only a handful of tools that could actually be useful and some general carrier bloat. If anything, this only got in my way while I was trying to organize my home screen. It’s also worth noting, however, that the built-in keyboard is still an abomination. The Second Screen The big feature that instantly catches the eye on the V20 is its second display. This extra bit of screen on top of the usual one is never used as an extension of the usual display, but rather used for shortcuts, glanceable information, or your “signature.” You can swipe left or right on the display to see shortcuts to tools such as the flashlight, recently opened apps, a dedicated row of favorite apps which you select, or media controls when the primary display is turned off. Is the second display useful? At first, I wrote this off as a gimmick, but I actually found myself using this display relatively often for accessing apps that I use most frequently like Hangouts or Slack. The display also shows notifications which is where it felt most useful of all. Quad DAC The other big story with the V20 is audio. This is the first phone ever with a built-in 32-bit Quad DAC out of the (thankfully included) 3.5mm headphone jack. I’m not an audiophile per say, but I do enjoy good tunes and use a 24-bit DAC myself when listening to music with my AudioTechnica ATH-M40x. Long story short, audio out of the V20 is great. The 32-bit DAC won’t turn bad audio good on a dime, but if you have solid audio, especially truly HiFi audio, you will notice the enhanced quality of the V20’s Quad DAC. To get the full experience you’ll need to activate it in the settings, but even with that off, quality is still slightly better than most smartphones. However, unless you have solid headphones and high-quality music, the DAC on the V20 won’t do too much for you. It’s a great feature to have, but it’s not the kind of thing that makes this phone worth buying; it’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. As for the built-in speaker, it’s downward facing, fairly loud, and pretty decent. There’s not much more to say there. The big story in audio is through the headphone jack. Cameras On the back of the V20, you’ll find two camera sensors ─ one 16MP standard sensor and another 8MP wide-angle lens. I’ll let the gallery of images below speak to the quality of this sensor, but long story short: it’s good. The camera is quick to take shots, autofocus is responsive and fast, and the camera UI is nothing short of fantastic. LG’s setup for dual-cameras is also, by far, my favorite on the market today. It’s very useful since you can capture so much more in a shot when you need to. LG’s camera app packs a ton of functionality behind an easy-to-understand interface. There’s a full manual mode that will satisfy photographers of just about any level too. This slideshow requires JavaScript. The V20 is also impressive regarding video quality, offering great UHD video quality and “Steady Record 2.0.” Long story short, this phone has improved video stabilization, and it’s pretty solid overall. It’s nowhere near what Google offers on the Pixel, but it’s better than a lot of other smartphones. Final Thoughts At the end of the day, there’s not much more to say about the V20. It is a fantastic device, and I can easily say that if you’re looking for a top of the line Android experience that, again, isn’t a Pixel, you should absolutely be looking at the V20. It goes on sale today, October 28th. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

In fact, earlier this year, Goldman Sachs researcher Heather Bellini estimated that the virtual reality and augmented reality industry will be an $80 billion market by 2025. That is the size of today’s desktop PC market. Perhaps that is why there is no shortage of companies rushing into the VR space and providing everything from complete virtual reality systems to gaming goggles and virtual reality games. Click through to see 20 companies cashing in on the very real virtual reality market. 1. Oculus The company that has become synonymous with virtual reality technology since its launch in 2012 released its most high-tech VR headset — the Oculus Rift — this past March. Funded by social media giant Facebook in 2014, most see Oculus as leading the VR charge. The Oculus Rift headset has garnered positive reviews, even at a price of $599. 2. 8i We bet you like yourself. Maybe so much that you wish you had more of you to go around. The company 8i agrees. It takes HD video and creates a virtual you, which you can then send into virtual worlds. And a lot of people appear to be interested. According to the tech site Nanalyze, 8i has raised $14.5 million in funding. See: The Top Video Game Franchises of All Time 3. Google Google is delving heavily into the VR space. Google Cardboard VR headsets — priced at $9.99 on Amazon — are impressive enough. But the company also owns YouTube, a potential major distribution channel for VR content. The 4-D sky is the limit. 4. Virtuix Founded in 2013, Virtuix makes the Omni, a motion platform to be used with a virtual headset that enables VR users to move “inside” their virtual reality. Using a platform and props, the company hopes to get VR as close to a real experience as possible. And many like what they are doing. The company raised more than $1 million in a 2013 Kickstarter campaign and $8 million more since. 5. Jaunt After traveling to Zion National Park in 2013, one of Jaunt's founders wished he could return again briefly. So, he helped start Jaunt so he could visit any time and from any place. Over the next few years, Jaunt created a professional-grade virtual reality camera that captures "high-quality 360-degree, stereoscopic, cinematic VR experiences," according to the company. Along the way, according to Nanalyze, Jaunt was funded to the tune of $100 million. More than half that total came from Disney. 6. Six Flags Are you afraid of roller coasters, but love the thrill that goes with them? Good news: Six Flags teamed up with Samsung to offer nine virtual reality roller coasters that use Samsung Gear VR headsets. Six Flags calls the technology "a definite game-changer for theme park rides." 7. GoPro The ubiquitous camera company is heavily invested in the world of VR with its Omni. Want to relive your bad surfing wipeout or totally awesome ski run? The Omni shoots every angle of it in high-definition. Going 3-D pro isn’t cheap, though. The Omni retails for just under $5,000. 8. Lowe’s The home improvement giant has been into VR since 2014, when it rolled out its Lowe’s Holoroom. The virtual reality home improvement design and visualization tool allows customers to find the right products and design elements to help with home improvement projects — and even preview the changes they'll make to their home. The service is in select Lowe’s locations across the country. 9. HTC Vive The Vive high-end VR headset and content was a collaboration between HTC and Valve. The headset retails for $799 on the site, but also comes with: Tilt Brush "The Gallery — Episode 1: Call of the Starseed" "Zombie Training Simulator"   10. Magic Leap   Magic Leap is a VR company that believes we all have the best VR computer right inside our heads. While everyone else is busy making headsets that close off the real world and thrust you into a virtual one, Magic Leap concentrates on using a virtual retina display to superimpose 3-D images onto the real world. Picture a whale leaping out of a gymnasium floor.   Related: 9 Tech-Savvy Ways to Double Your Income     11. Mandt VR   This Hollywood-based production company was founded by Emmy-award winning TV and film producer Neil Mandt.

CBS News October 28, 2016, 11:43 AM The phishing email that hacked the account of John Podesta Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email March 2016 This appears to be the phishing email that hacked Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account. Further, The Clinton campaign’s own computer help desk thought it was real email sent by Google, even though the email address had a suspicious “googlemail.com” extension.  The John Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks Phishing email sent to John Podesta Released by WikiLeaks The email, with the subject line “*Someone has your password,*” greeted Podesta, “Hi John” and then said, “Someone just used your password to try to sign into your Google Account john.podesta@gmail.com.” Then it offered a time stamp and an IP address in “Location: Ukraine.”  “Google stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password immediately.” And it then offered a link to change his password. “This is a legitimate email,” Charles Delevan at the HFA help desk wrote to Podesta’s chief of staff, Sara Latham. “John needs to change his password immediately, and ensure that two-factor authentication is turned on his account.” Email from Clinton campaign’s help desk advising Podesta to change his email Released by Wikileaks, October 2016 Delevan included the Gmail link that would be used to change a user’s password, but whoever changed Podesta’s password instead clicked on the shortened URL that was in the original phishing email. This is the same technique used to hack Colin Powell’s emails and the Democratic National Committee emails, according to the website Motherboard. All of these hacks were executed using these shortened URLs in fake emails, according to Motherboard, and those URLs “were created with a Bitly account linked to a domain under the control of Fancy Bear,” a group of Russian hackers.  In October, WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of Podesta’s emails daily before the November presidential election.  CBS News’ Katiana Krawchenko contributed to this report. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel is calling on Facebook and Google to be much more transparent on how their algorithms work. Merkel wants those firms and others to reveal how they learn and understand people’s internet usage patterns, ultimately catering exactly what they view when they access the internet. One needs only look at the U.S. election to understand a bit of what Merkel is asking for. If you browse the internet and typically tend to look at conservative things, for example, then Google or Facebook might start to only show conservative stories, given that those properties know that’s what you’re more likely to click on and learn about. But that can also be troublesome because it starts to narrow the field of view for online users. “The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle, which diverse media must pass through to reach users,” Merkel told Germany’s Der Spiegel, according to BBC. “These algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information.” Merkel worried about Google’s influence Google and Facebook believe they’re already transparent enough about this information. Indeed, you can use Facebook to enter in information on which way you’ll plan to vote. And various news articles over the past several months have shown how the social network displays different content depending on what it thinks you’re interested in. This works for plenty of things, like shopping, where it can be valuable to end users. I don’t have kids, Facebook and Google probably know that based on my habits, and so I’m not shown ads for toys or baby wipes and the like. Algorithms work well in those cases. But when it comes to news, it’s incredibly important for readers to find what’s important and true, not necessarily catered content that they’ll like. Facebook’s news policies have been under fire all year, particularly after reports exposed the social network of favoring specific media outlets and choosing the topics viewers see – sometimes including bogus news articles. Merkel’s right to call on reform in this space.

Here's how he makes creativity a team sport. Thundercat performing at theRed Bull Music Academy public show, Kaléidoscope 1754, on October 20th. [Photo:Maria Jose Govea/Red Bull Music Academy] Jared Lindzon 10.28.16 5:00 AM Creative collaboration isn’t as simple as putting a few smart people in the same room. That's likely why some of the world's biggest tech companies, whose offices are packed with some of the brightest minds, invest significant time and money into building policies, physical spaces, and a workplace culture to foster creative collaboration and innovation. "Before working with Kendrick I made sure I knew as much as I could about his career, his musical strengths, areas that he could explore." The Google Garage, for example, was specifically designed to ignite creative collaboration between employees. Companies like Google understand that everything from managerial relationships to physical office layouts will ultimately dictate whether or not creativity is able to flourish. Whether in technology, business, or music, there are certain elements leaders must consider in order to get the most out of their teams. That's also the philosophy behind the Red Bull Music Academy in Montreal, where a group of established musicians is mentoring the next generation of musical talent. Fast Company recently caught up with one of its studio tutors, Grammy award-winning performer, producer, and musician Stephen "Thundercat" Bruner, to discuss his work mentoring young creative talent. As a creative force behind Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 chart-topping album To Pimp a Butterfly, Bruner shares five lessons that experience taught him about collaboration. 1. Make Sure Everyone's Roles Are Clear Whether in a music studio or an office boardroom, Bruner believes that it's important for everyone around the table to arrive with a "knowledgable perspective and understanding" of what they want to achieve, and where each member of the team fits into the equation. "If you are trying to extract creativity from coworkers in different departments, they need to take the time learn about each other’s roles in the company before starting to collaborate," he says. Bruner adds that the same is true when putting together a Grammy award-winning album with one of the country’s hottest artists. "Before working with Kendrick, I made sure I knew as much as I could about his career, his musical strengths, areas that he could explore further and areas I could support," Bruner observes, "all while trying to understand ultimately what kind of album Kendrick would want to end up with."

Find A Comfortable Environment Though it may not seem significant on the surface, the physical design and layout of a space can have a big impact on fostering creativity. For example, when working on To Pimp a Butterfly, Lamar abandoned his home studio in Los Angeles where he'd been recording for four years, in favor of a new space in New York City "in order to add a different vibe to the creative process," says Bruner. Bruner believes that physical spaces ultimately dictate creative head spaces, so all aspects of the environment need to be considered. "The fabric of the couch, plants, and natural light all can make a difference," he says. Like Lamar’s decision to move his recording sessions across the country, Bruner says managers should consider taking the team to a comfortable and creative space offsite. "Boardrooms don’t breed creativity," he adds. 3. Be Hands On, But Not Too Hands On Though managers need to maintain some level of control, Bruner believes they also need to operate at a comfortable distance in order to allow creativity to flourish. "The fabric of the couch, plants, and natural light all can make a difference." "As a leader, being hands on in the creative process is a careful balance between being involved enough to make sure everyone has a voice, and being removed enough to make them feel they are in control," he says. "Creativity is very personal. There maybe somebody who is not as comfortable expressing themselves, so you have to let them know there is no judgment in that space." 4. Find A Pace That Works For Everyone Because of that highly individualistic approach to creativity, Bruner knows that collaborators often work at different speeds, but he suggests that they eventually have to find a pace that works for everyone. He explains that when he began working with Lamar, the rapper worked at an incredibly fast rate, and Bruner had to learn where to jump in and contribute. "Once I got up to speed it was like 'drafting' in a bike race," he says. "Kendrick was creatively moving so fast that I was able to draft behind him and advance my own creativity." 5. Just Be Patient Working well with others often requires a period of adjustment, which Bruner believes is an uncomfortable but vital part of the process. "The first part of a collaboration can be messy, as you don’t always click right away with the person you are working with," he says. "In order to get in step together creatively, you have to be prepared that you could be [in] sync before you achieve." Though the process can be difficult at first, those initial frustrations eventually give way to a more collaborative environment. "Sometimes creative processes won’t initially match and big ideas won’t come easy," Bruner continues, "but if you provide your team with the tools they need to successfully collaborate, it will happen."

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations News NASA, Space and Science Trips to Mars won't make quick money, but venture capitalists are jumping on other space projects Google satellites take off Nationa Center for Space Studies / AFP A Vega rocket lifts off in June 2016 from the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, with small Earth-observation satellites for Terra Bella, a Google company. A Vega rocket lifts off in June 2016 from the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, with small Earth-observation satellites for Terra Bella, a Google company. (Nationa Center for Space Studies / AFP) Samantha Masunaga Privacy Policy In 2010, Bessemer Venture Partners decided to invest in an intriguing start-up that would build and launch a network of small satellites for a fraction of the typical cost. Four years later, that small satellite and remote imaging company, Skybox Imaging, was acquired by Google for $500 million in cash. The company, now known as Terra Bella, has launched seven satellites into orbit. Terra Bella’s lucrative exit, along with the well-publicized exploits of SpaceX, have helped spur increased investment in space and space-related start-ups by top venture capital firms better known for their support of technology companies like Yelp, LinkedIn and Jawbone. “When we saw that Google, a mainstream tech company, all of a sudden had an interest in space, that was a big moment to realize that space is now important to a lot of companies,” said Sunil Nagaraj, vice president at Silicon Valley-based Bessemer. And whereas SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk has made clear he’s willing to spend billions to establish a base on Mars, these VCs have more down-to-earth goals.  “It’s not just passion projects or philanthropists,” said Nagaraj. “We’re there to make money, and we’re actually seeing that happening.” In 2015, more than 50 venture capital firms invested in space or space-related companies — the highest number in the 15 years that consultant Tauri Group has been tracking the data. The $1.8 billion invested in space companies last year also was a high, although that mostly reflects two big investments: a $1-billion stake in SpaceX by Google and Fidelity Investments, and $500 million in satellite constellation firm OneWeb by a group of investors. Even without these two deals, venture capital investments in space totaled $300 million in 2015, a significant increase from $94.3 million in 2014.  Venture capital overall is flush with money seeking decent returns in a low-yield world. U.S. venture funds raised a total $32 billion from January through September, almost as much as in all of 2015 and a record-setting pace, according to the National Venture Capital Assn. Much of the interest in the space sector is in small satellite start-ups that capture images of the Earth and in data analytics companies that rely on feeds from small satellites. That data is valuable to industries such as agriculture, energy and forestry, according to venture capitalists and industry experts. “You’ve got this confluence of … privatization of the space sector, lower costs of the space sector versus the past, and these large venture funds that are looking for opportunities to deploy capital,” said Robert Siegel, a lecturer in management at Stanford University and partner at XSeed Capital. Technological advancements such as in batteries and the miniaturization of processors have allowed satellites to shrink dramatically. In the 1990s and even still today, satellites could be as large as a school bus. Now, they can be the size of a dorm room mini-fridge, or even a shoebox. “It used to be that if you wanted to do Earth observation … you needed very big satellites,” said Sven Strohband, partner and chief technology officer at Khosla Ventures, which has invested in Skybox, Los Angeles-based Rocket Lab and agricultural data firm Climate Corp, which was acquired by Monsanto Co. in 2013 for $930 million. “You can do an astonishing amount of work with a smaller satellite.” It costs about as much to launch an app as it does to make and launch a satellite. — Sunil Nagaraj, vice president, Bessemer Venture Partners Smaller sizes mean cheaper manufacturing costs, which have allowed companies like Terra Bella and the San Francisco-based Earth-imaging firm Planet to launch so-called satellite constellations that ensure that one or two failures won’t knock out remote-sensing or Earth observation abilities. Building a shoebox-sized satellite can cost between $100,000 and $300,000, said Nagaraj of Bessemer. “It costs about as much to launch an app as it does to make and launch a satellite,” he said. “We’ve reduced the cost of entry to start tinkering.” The firm has invested more than $50 million across three space companies — Skybox, Rocket Lab and small satellite maker Spire. Venture capitalists say these new satellite constellations should be more successful than those envisioned in the 1990s that were intended to provide telecommunications coverage across the globe. Because communications networks can’t offer complete service with just one satellite, those constellations are an “all-or-nothing proposition,” Nagaraj said. But with remote-sensing or Earth observation satellites, “you can derive value starting with satellite No. 1,” he said. Nagaraj and Strohband said they see one to three space-related pitches a week. “There seems to be a new attraction to this because it is technologically possible ... and there’s some early proof points that the economics can also be good,” Strohband said. “I think that’s going to continue for at least a little while.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    YouTube has emerged as a break-out star in Google's cast of services as the online video site upstages cable television for a younger generation of viewers looking for amusement, news and music on their smartphones. The trend is contributing to an advertising shift away from traditional network television programming to the more eclectic and diversified mix of clips ranging from cute cat videos to sobering shots of street violence found on YouTube. As more advertising dollars flow to YouTube, it's making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report released Thursday, Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 percent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 percent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. All that money is providing Google with more financial firepower to buy the rights to stream cable networks' shows on YouTube, too, something likely to reel in even more viewers. It also is helping to finance Alphabet's investments in far-flung projects ranging from self-driving cars to internet-beaming balloons. That segment, known as "Other Bets," lost $865 million during the July-September period, narrowing from a $980 million setback last year as Alphabet imposed more expense controls. YouTube already has proven to be one of the best bets that Google has ever made since it bought the video site for $1.76 billion a decade ago. At that juncture, YouTube consisted mostly of crudely made videos shot by amateurs and clips pirated from movie and TV studios that were threatening to sue the site into oblivion. It had built a worldwide audience of about 72 million viewers when Google took control in November 2006. Since then, YouTube has evolved into a far more polished channel that has spawned unlikely stars such as "PewDiePie" (Swedish comedian Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg) while largely making peace with studios by creating an automated screening system that detects pirated content. YouTube says it has paid more than $2 billion to studios that have chosen to leave their material on the site and share in the ad revenue generated by their clips. Meanwhile, YouTube's audience has surpassed 1 billion, with 80 percent of the viewers outside the U.S. YouTube also boasts that its site reaches more people between the ages of 18 and 34 years old — the "millennial" generation — than any cable network. That segment of YouTube's audience is a major reason why more than half its video clips are watched on mobile devices. Google CEO Sundar Pichai likened YouTube to prime-time TV "for the mobile world" in a Thursday conference call that was streamed on YouTube. He told analysts that YouTube "continues to shine" as more major advertisers promote their brands on the site. Alphabet doesn't disclose how much money YouTube is making, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates YouTube's annual revenue has now reached $10 billion and is increasing by as much as 40 percent a year. The growth makes YouTube "one of the strongest assets fundamentally on the internet today," Mahaney wrote in a research note earlier this week. Despite its progress, YouTube has been slow in realizing its full potential, leaving it vulnerable to new challengers for viewer's attention, such as Facebook's Live video feature, says Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson. The problem, as Olson sees it, is that YouTube has had trouble persuading TV and movie studios to license more of their content on their site, something that that might have made YouTube as dominant in video as Google is in search. But YouTube could be on a major breakthrough, according to a report published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal. Citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Google had reached an agreement with CBS to include its network in a cable-like service called "Unplugged" that will debut on YouTube next year. Google is also negotiating for the rights to the Fox network, ESPN and NBC, among others, the Journal said. Google cited YouTube licensing rights as one of the reasons that its costs to generate revenue, excluding ad commissions, rose by $1 billion, or 30 percent, from last year. "The dam appears to be finally cracking" for even better content to come to YouTube, Olson said. © Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Play Video CBSN YouTube stars interview President Obama The social media star known as "Swoozie" was one of three YouTubers who got to interview President Obama. "Swoozie," who's real name is Adande Th... The trend is contributing to an advertising shift away from traditional network television programming to the more eclectic and diversified mix of clips ranging from cute cat videos to sobering shots of street violence found on YouTube. As more advertising dollars flow to YouTube, it’s making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report released Thursday, Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 percent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 percent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. All that money is providing Google with more financial firepower to buy the rights to stream cable networks’ shows on YouTube, too, something likely to reel in even more viewers. It also is helping to finance Alphabet’s investments in far-flung projects ranging from self-driving cars to internet-beaming balloons. That segment, known as “Other Bets,” lost $865 million during the July-September period, narrowing from a $980 million setback last year as Alphabet imposed more expense controls. YouTube already has proven to be one of the best bets that Google has ever made since it bought the video site for $1.76 billion a decade ago. At that juncture, YouTube consisted mostly of crudely made videos shot by amateurs and clips pirated from movie and TV studios that were threatening to sue the site into oblivion. It had built a worldwide audience of about 72 million viewers when Google took control in November 2006. Play Video Entertainment YouTube stars redefine fame The Internet is changing what it means to be a celebrity. Since then, YouTube has evolved into a far more polished channel that has spawned unlikely stars such as “PewDiePie” (Swedish comedian Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg) while largely making peace with studios by creating an automated screening system that detects pirated content. YouTube says it has paid more than $2 billion to studios that have chosen to leave their material on the site and share in the ad revenue generated by their clips. Meanwhile, YouTube’s audience has surpassed 1 billion, with 80 percent of the viewers outside the U.S. YouTube also boasts that its site reaches more people between the ages of 18 and 34 years old – the “millennial” generation – than any cable network. That segment of YouTube’s audience is a major reason why more than half its video clips are watched on mobile devices. Google CEO Sundar Pichai likened YouTube to prime-time TV “for the mobile world” in a Thursday conference call that was streamed on YouTube. He told analysts that YouTube “continues to shine” as more major advertisers promote their brands on the site. Alphabet doesn’t disclose how much money YouTube is making, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates YouTube’s annual revenue has now reached $10 billion and is increasing by as much as 40 percent a year. The growth makes YouTube “one of the strongest assets fundamentally on the internet today,” Mahaney wrote in a research note earlier this week. Despite its progress, YouTube has been slow in realizing its full potential, leaving it vulnerable to new challengers for viewer’s attention, such as Facebook’s Live video feature, says Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson. Play Video CBS This Morning "Awkward Black Girl" Issa Rae brings unique spin to TV "The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl" creator and star Issa Rae started making shows for YouTube as a student at Stanford University. Her epi... The problem, as Olson sees it, is that YouTube has had trouble persuading TV and movie studios to license more of their content on their site, something that that might have made YouTube as dominant in video as Google is in search. But YouTube could be on a major breakthrough, according to a report published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal. Citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Google had reached an agreement with CBS to include its network in a cable-like service called “Unplugged” that will debut on YouTube next year. Google is also negotiating for the rights to the Fox network, ESPN and NBC, among others, the Journal said. Google cited YouTube licensing rights as one of the reasons that its costs to generate revenue, excluding ad commissions, rose by $1 billion, or 30 percent, from last year. “The dam appears to be finally cracking” for even better content to come to YouTube, Olson said. © 2016 The Associated Press.

 You can now go on a 'Stranger Things' scavenger hunt using Google's new messaging app Avery Hartmans Oct. 28, 2016, 10:51 AM 1,270 facebook linkedin twitter email print The character Barb from Netflix show "Stranger Things." Netflix Google is using its new messaging app Allo to send people on a "Stranger Things"-inspired scavenger hunt. Today only in New York City — that's Friday, October 28 — users of Allo, Google's AI-powered messaging app, can embark on a scavenger hunt to locate Barb, one of the show's characters who mysteriously disappeared.  According to Engadget, if you ask Google's Assistant within Allo "Where is Barb?", it will reveal the first location of the hunt, which will take you throughout the city. The hunt could result in winning prizes, like a BMX bike, Pentax camera or a Panasonic boombox, according to Engadget.  Google itself was mysterious about the scavenger hunt, writing only this on its official blog: Google Allo will help you unlock your powers today in New York City. Stay tuned to Google on Twitter for a hint on where the drop-off from Hawkins National Laboratories will take place. Google is also unveiling new features to the Allo app, including a new "Stranger Things"-inspired sticker pack, the option to reply to messages directly from your notifications on both Android and iOS, and split-screen mode, which is a feature of Android N. The option to draw on photos, which was only available for Android users at launch, is now available on iOS. The Allo app was the first Google product to use Google's Assistant, which uses AI to help answer questions and provide information, much like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa (Google has now added the Assistant to its new Pixel phone and Google Home device, too). By the end of September, Allo had reached 5 million downloads in the Google Play store, five days after it launched. But the company is mostly letting the app's user base grow organically, opting not to make it standard on its new phone or requiring it of Android phone developers. The app is now No. 96 on the Play store's top free apps.  SEE ALSO: Google just launched its answer to Siri.

SUBSCRIBE Micro-moments and beyond: Understanding and optimizing for consumer intent Want to reach search engine users in their moments of need? Columnist Thomas Stern explains his process for mapping keywords and content to the customer's path to purchase. Thomas Stern on October 28, 2016 at 10:51 am More Google introduced the concept of micro-moments over a year ago, and since then, the company has consistently published supporting information as it relates to specific industries and user behavior across content platforms. If you’re unfamiliar with micro-moments, they’re essentially a way of framing a user’s path to purchase or to conversion, with specific focus on mobile and the needs or questions users search on Google along with way. The concept of micro-moments is easily digestible and provides a great way of conducting and organizing keyword research, something search marketing practitioners and decision-makers alike can certainly appreciate. At our agency, ZOG Digital, we’ve been developing ways to comprehensively identify micro-moment opportunities for clients while mapping and optimizing to the consumer’s conversion path. The following is a high-level look at our approach and a few of the resources we use. 1. Identifying micro-moments: The consumer journey Before you can identify micro-moment opportunities, you must understand the structure or user path and adapt it to your particular business or vertical. For instance, we categorize micro-moments for hospitality clients into Dreaming, Exploring, Planning and Booking; these buckets support each step in the consumer journey to bookings, and keyword opportunities can logically be categorized within them. Google uses a fairly ubiquitous micro-moment structure of “I want to know,” “I want to go,” “I want to do” and “I want to buy.” Unlike the categorization structure I noted above, Google’s classification maps micro-moments to different types of consumer journeys with additional research to support best practices for search content. Either of these examples can work, as long as consumer intent can be appropriately segmented. Keywords are the backbone of this phase and enable future content to be planned, developed and published by each opportunity category. 2. Organizing micro-moments: Defining parameters and collecting data With keyword categorization structure understood, the next step is to map out the keyword modifiers that users will use in their path to conversion. Our philosophy is to use all available modifiers, with an understanding that not all will apply to each client. This approach allows us to cast the widest net and effectively understand the micro-moment opportunity size. Here are some example modifiers grouped under questions and prepositions: Questions: (Keyword) + Where, Which, Who, Why, What, How and Are Example hospitality-related searches using questions could be “Things to Do in San Francisco” or “Where to Stay in Miami.” Prepositions: (Keyword) + With, Without, Versus, Near, Like and For. Example retail-based searches using prepositions could be “Tablet vs. Laptop” or “Ceiling Fan with Lights.” At ZOG Digital, we predefine all keyword modifiers so we can map across keyword lists at scale. However, if you’re looking to define micro-moments across a small set of keywords, we recommend Answer the Public and Keyword.io as great starting points. Answer the Public predefines questions and prepositions automatically, while Keyword.io allows you to segment keyword results by questions once they’ve been retrieved. It’s important to note that collecting micro-moment data doesn’t stop at the keyword level. To effectively understand opportunity size and prioritize tactics, consumer intent and demand needs to be identified and grouped within the aforementioned consumer journey stages. This research process provides a segue into our next step, which is building a plan for ROI. 3. Forecasting and prioritizing for ROI The next step to moving forward with micro-moment opportunity analysis and planning is to forecast potential and prioritize for ROI. My agency developed our own tool, the Keyword Revenue Forecasting Tool, to automate this process with historical client performance data, but a basic one can be created through Excel and a few simple formulas. First, you’ll need to determine a click-through rate by keyword position. There are numerous data sources for this — we like Advanced Web Ranking, as they regularly update their CTR data. The best option, if you have enough data, is to use Search Console and filter out branded keywords. This will then most closely resemble the CTR you can expect from each keyword position. Second, you need to forecast how your rankings can improve over time. This is a bit tricky without substantial historical data, so the next best option is to look at where similar websites rank for the keywords you’re targeting. Check the domain and PageRank of the websites that rank in the top positions for each keyword. If you are within range comparatively, chances are that you have a likelihood of competing, assuming you’re conducting comprehensive on- and off-page optimization. The improvement over time is tricky here — if you have performed SEO in the past for the site, you should be conservative and make assumptions based on performance you have observed historically. Finally, you can now calculate potential return based on the metrics you have available: (keyword position CTR) x (keyword search volume) x (organic conversion rate) x (organic average order value) When possible, we like to make these calculations at a categorical level, applying unique conversion rate and average order volume (AOV) data to get the most accurate results. 4. Content analysis and selection After assessing the value of keywords and micro-moments, one final step needs to occur before defining content topics and types. It’s important to examine and dissect the search results and content that currently exists for each keyword. Because Google takes into account the context of each search term and displays the most relevant results, the types of results revealed will give you an idea of the intent behind the query. For example, a search term with modifiers like “best” or “top” may imply the user is seeking an article, blog post or list, while a search term that includes modifiers like “discount” or “buy” may suggest the user is looking for a product page. Inspecting content types indexed in search results can inform future content that will succeed at each stage of the consumer journey. Particularly, deciphering content trends for each phase will inform the long-term content strategy for brands and agencies to begin building together. ­With micro-moments inspired by Google, savvy marketers can see the consumer journey through a new lens and gain further insights from keyword categorization. Google has recently published an article, “Micro-Moments: 5 Questions to Ask Your Agency,” that concisely summarizes many of the aforementioned steps and recommendations. We highly encourage reviewing for assessing agency partners and internal teams alike. Some opinions expressed in this article may be those of a guest author and not necessarily Search Engine Land.

A bug has apparently triggered the emails after a change was made yesterday that affected Partners in many markets. Steve Seeley tweeted a screen shot of the email yesterday and cautioned others to “not flip out if you got emails like this last night or this morning. It is a bug. Our entire status is blank.” #ppcchat do not flip out if you got emails like this last night or this morning. It is a bug.

Italy-based digital marketer Gianpaolo Lorusso tells us it’s likely a global bug, and it is definitely affecting the US, Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Spain. We’ve reached out to Google for comment and will update when we hear back. Update:  A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land, “Due to a bug, we sent an inaccurate email to a number of agencies about their Partner status. We’re asking them to disregard these notices. We’re working to fix the issue and will let our partners know when it’s resolved.” Update 10/30: The issue has been resolved.
