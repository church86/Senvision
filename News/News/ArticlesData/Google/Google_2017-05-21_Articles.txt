Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 319 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares533 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated. I'm ready to give up on android and an unreliable beta company. but add me to the list of sabotaged 6p lovers.

Android O feature spotlight: Quick settings are now grayscale, get some other small tweaks 2017/05/17 1:55pm PDTMay 17, 2017 ... View All 56 Articles In This Series During today's keynote at Google I/O, Google revealed a couple of interesting figures about the upcoming Android O release. Namely, it should be a lot faster in certain regards. Google says that the Pixel, for example, will reboot up to twice as fast on Android O (it does take a while at the moment). It wasn't immediately clear what optimizations allowed for this boosted performance. As in the hero image of this post, Google also alluded to improved performance for apps at large. Using Google Sheets as an example, Google claimed that when running a set of typical workload benchmarks in the app, Sheets completed operations over twice as quickly in these scenarios. How exactly this is happening, again, is unclear. But it's certainly good news - faster apps are better apps. The improved reboot times should further reduce the amount of time necessary to install an OTA update on your device. Last year at I/O, Google announced seamless updates, allowing you to install updates on your phone in the background on a separate system partition while you can continue to use the device. Rebooting is still something that has to happen with seamless updates, though, and it sounds like Android O should make that process even faster.

No one here can come with new jokes? marcusmarcus2 No kidding. People keep making this joke more than Google makes messaging apps. Kinda ridiculous. Corey Kinard Quality post. Fernando Pena She is like that overexcited character from an episode of Friends... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DJblHzEdLw 4Ui812 Google Sheets and twice as fast eh ? Maybe the O stands for orgasm :-) T4rd The Spotlight I'm waiting for: "Apps can no longer hide behind 'Android OS' or 'Android System' in the battery stats." blindexecutioner I agree. I know the LED notification managing apps do that. I am not sure it is to be sneaky about it but rather it's just probably how the system is designed. I still think they're worth it but a lot of times people have no idea an app is what is causing their drain and they blame Android/Google for it. Winston That by itself would warrant a totally new letter release for me. As Trump would say, it's YUUGE. On Samsung at least, it now tells you approximately how much battery an app is draining. Interesting statistic: WhatsApp drains between four to seven times more battery than *fking Snapchat*. Teja Hell yeah! Android system is taking 15-20% of my battery on my Oneplus 3. Still can't figure which package is causing this. I at least hope they give individual battery stats for packages included in the so called "Android OS" and "Android System" marcusmarcus2 This will greatly improve the bootloop speeds of some devices. Christopher Kruthoff Clearly the real reason behind such a feature! VAVAMk_2 LG I am looking at you... marcusmarcus2 Oh yeah, well LG is looking at... ...LG is looking at... ...LG is looking at... ...LG is looking at... Roh_Mish Youuuu you you, youuuu, you you yooooooooooo Madaliso 🌞 hahah Fernando Pena This is probably true, my phone is A LOT faster after DP2 update. I mean, even faster than the latest stable nougat version. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach I noticed this two on my Nexus 6p. It boots faster than my S8. Fernando Pena I meant overall performance, apps, system and boot as well... Jey How's the battery work far? Fernando Pena I can't say anything battery just yet, let's see how it performs overnight and along the day tomorrow... Drakenoid How was it? Fernando Pena It's ok for me, standby drain definitely decreased related to nougat. Overall I would say there is an improvement. Tr3ple On my pixel too, I'm impressed blindexecutioner Lol,yeah, ok. I am sure battery life will be quadrupled too. balthazar Could, would, should, won't ... Roy Let's be optimistic and maybe on the Pixel it will. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach Does the S8 support seamless updates? Tim Harman Why would it matter? Samsung will stop providing updates for it as soon as the S9 comes out. (I actually did some Google for you and the answer seems to be "No" but I couldn't find anything confirming it one way or another) D13H4RD2L1V3 Nope. The only phone that supports seamless updates is the Pixel. Corey Kinard Hopefully the OP5 goes for it. It's only a feature useful for phones that actually get updated. JD Except the downside is it takes up a chunk of your Storage Corey Kinard I think the majority of the "chunks of storage" I allow things to take up, I allow expressly so it makes my life easier. This fits that bill too imo. If 32 is going to be the new default, I'm willing to let the system eat up an extra gig if it's adding something useful. I wish manufacturers were forced to display the usable amount of memory their phone ships with anyway. It makes no sense to me that two phones can advertise they both come with 32 gigs and Storage and when you open one up you're getting 25 and with the other 18. Winston No. My phone's day one patch installed as it usually does. Lord Argyris "Google says that the Pixel, for example, will reboot up to twice as fast on Android O..." I wonder how many lifetimes they reckon this saves. bL4Ck Cool, but when a phone starts in a decent amount of time isn't that already good enough? After all these years of smartphones i don't think many turn off their phones at all unless they have to, my 6P often reaches 3-4 weeks of up-time then i randomly restart it for reasons or because play services starts acting weird and drains the battery. I feel like they're putting their focus on the wrong problems, slow boot times was an issue 10 years ago when people were still used to Nokia phones having basic features work even when switched off, but now people either put their phones in airplane mode during the night or switch them to silent, so having twice as fast boot up times isn't going to affect anyone's life in any meaningful way. Winston I think it was really just for show, as the most visible change in the speed. Most things on phones don't really take that long anymore, and they wanted to highlight just how fast the new OS is, so they reduced the boot time by half. JD The conversation started like this. Googler 1: Android and Play services is a mess we have no fucking clue how to fix all these issues. Googler 2: Have we tried making new messaging apps? Googler 1: Yes but that didn't fix anything Googler 2: Add more Emojis and Sticker packs so they can vent their frustrations? Googler 1: Yes but still it didn't fix the bugs Googler 2: What do you think would fix it then? Googler 1: I told you we don't know how, I have to keep rebooting my phone just to keep it working. Googler 2: Genius! You solved it! Just make the phone reboot faster! Maybe make it loop automatically. Googler 1: Why did LG let you go again? Maxwell “Max” Weinbach yep Stu The estimates are probably generous but I do feel like Android has finally matured with nougat and it would make sense if the OS became a lot more refined from this point forward. Not a parallel comparison obviously, but you saw similar with iOS. JD The last time it matured was with 4.4 then Google decided it was time trade the T mature for an N in 5.0 and kept that up all the way in to 7.0 Beebs Vaporware. Samsung has me on Android 4.4 kit kat D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, I wonder how this translates to actual real-world use. Like is it possible to notice the difference? From what I've heard, that seems to be the case. deh2002 Will be great for LG buyer's Dmitry Stepanushkin 2x faster bootloops? LineOS for exynos! LMAO! But I love lg just1box Google needs to focus on ONLY THREE things. 1. steamlined/faster OS updates 2. SINGLE All in one rich text messaging app standard across ALL devices and web/PC app 3. really goose Dev's to optimize apps for tablets (The fact the tablet section in PlayStore has basically 5 MORE apps than ALL of Windows 10 app availability is offensive this far along in Android.) Rod I'd add in standby battery drain in there, too. Rod Does this mean Android phones won't be embarrassed at PhoneBuff speed tests anymore? Yay! Maxwell “Max” Weinbach if you do the Pixel vs the iPhone 7, i think the pixel would win. A nexus 6p vs S8, the nexus wins. Rod Are we watching the same videos? Roh_Mish Would love this on my XZ. It is a solid performer but my god does it take its own sweet time booting up. Lars Jeppesen Why do you boot your device? Keep it alive, dawg.. Roh_Mish Mostly because sometimes due to really heavy use i drain my battery and it shuts down by night. Before 7.1 i had it get really laggy and i had to reboot. Сергей Бугаев They did mention some details about how they accomplished this, for example concurrent garbage collection and heap defragmentation, but we'll hear more in the dedicated ART news session.

Well shuck the corn and light the barn fires! Since rebooting IS THE ABSOLUTE LEAST FREQUENT ACTIVITY, assigning development to speed it up seems like THE LAMEST waste of talent/time.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 235 Plus 1 on G+ 1178 Share on Facebook 437 Share on Twitter Total Shares1850 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SafetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms that: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play Store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English.

AntiCoyote Not really fair, every single Dutch person I know speaks English as well as an American :o) C64 I'm sorry that we Dutch learn English at school :p davidus The real reason behind this is that there arent many ppl to talk to in first place, if u only speak dutch. Trust me, i m from a neighbour country ;) Me Or some Bixby xyz I don't think Google can translate dipshit. Seems to be a rarely spoken language. pcriz Um okay, whatever that means.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). Yan Minari You better tell us more about how you set up this. stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Thomas Gladdines That's nonsense, the recovery works fine with or without a locked bootloader. Only fastboot won't work but that's only needed when you don't have a custom recovery to flash images. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. 天地人 Theft is when I take your bike and it's gone and you do not have a bike anymore. When I pirate, are you losing your software or your right to sell your software? Plus, if you actually developed software, I'd probably pay for it since you aren't some big corporation. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. 天地人 Of course it depends on what you're watching. The same ideology cannot be applied to everything. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... My1 yeah true. pirating on phone makes (quoting austin from game theory) NO. GOD. DAMN. SENSE. I mean I dunno whether you can automate that so good and/or get it fast enough, especially with the relatively low storage, no LAN capability and so on. BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem?

Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future.

By Tas Bindi | May 22, 2017 -- 00:46 GMT (17:46 PDT) | Topic: SMBs Businesses have different needs at different stages of their growth, and the tools chosen at each stage of growth can impact how a company progresses. A study of more than 200 Australian technology businesses conducted in December 2016 by payments company Stripe found the average business uses six to 10 cloud-based tools for a range of functions including accounting, analytics, code repositories, CRM, hosting and data storage, human resources, and team collaboration and communication. ZDNet spoke to six Australian businesses at various stages of growth about the tools they have chosen and how their choices have evolved over time. Nitro Adam Nowiski, APAC director at Nitro Image: Supplied Founded 12 years ago in Melbourne, Australia, and now headquartered in San Francisco, Nitro considers itself a "leading" alternative to Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Document Cloud. As a fast-growing company with more than 600,000 customers globally, Nitro now invests heavily in tools that can support its sales and marketing teams. Adam Nowiski, Asia Pacific director at Nitro, told ZDNet that Marc Andreessen's famous quote "software is eating the world" rings true for sales. "Even five years ago, it was literally a CRM and a phonebook for the most successful revenue teams. But these days it doesn't matter what part of the sales process you're working on, there's an application for it -- whether that be lead generation or email automation or contract management," Nowiski said. "We're taking that approach of always looking for the next potential piece of software that could improve our capability." Nowiski said Nitro relies heavily on Salesforce as its single source of truth. "Salesforce is very much the centre of our universe. Everything that gets built and everything that gets purchased must have a Salesforce integration," Nowiski said. "Our accounting and finance package which is Netsuite, our ecommerce package which is from Cleverbridge, all must be able to talk to Salesforce to reconcile and update customer information. "We use a couple of lead scoring solutions that actually plug directly into Salesforce and provide information to us about the type of buyer of our software and what potential chance we have of converting them into a customer based on, for example, their social media platform, based on their LinkedIn profile, based on the historical data we've got on the types of customers that we do really well with." Wherever it makes sense, Nitro tries to stick with Salesforce products, even switching from external vendors such as Marketo to ExactTarget and Pardot for marketing activities, and Zendesk to Service Desk for customer support. However, it does not always make sense, Nowiski admitted. "We thought we had to use a Salesforce integration and then we realised that something else was better. For example, Salesforce has a longstanding capability in internal office communications through a product called Chattr. We used that for a period of time but when Slack came out -- Slack does have an integration to Salesforce, but it's a standalone solution -- it very quickly became the communication platform of choice. It didn't really matter that it wasn't a Salesforce tool. The integration was appropriate and our users loved it," he explained. Nowiski said early-stage companies will not gain much from adopting Salesforce. "It will cost you too much and the benefit is very little. When your customer and user base grows, then you will need a more robust, more complex CRM system, but until then, it's not necessary," Nowiski said. "There are some great solutions out there that are not expensive, that are appropriate for you at the stage that you are in. But always keep in mind about what's potentially coming down the track. Look to the Valley about what is trending in terms of technology to help the business. They're the innovators, they're the pioneers." LiveTiles Simon Tyrrell, CPO at LiveTiles Image: Supplied Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)-listed company LiveTiles has a strong relationship with Microsoft, with its core products sitting on top of Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint, and Azure. LiveTiles provides tools that allow companies to create custom digital workspaces -- akin to a bespoke intranet -- with API integrations that enable a diverse range of programs to work together. The business was spun out of a company called nSynergy in December 2014, which has since been acquired by ASX-listed cloud services company Rhipe. In addition to Azure and Office forming the the backbone of LiveTiles' core products, it also uses Microsoft products including Skype for Business, Sharepoint, Yammer, Planner, and Visual Studio for internal collaborative activities. "We're not a startup where everyone started in one office. We started with me in Hobart, the CEO in New York, the co-founder in Melbourne, the CFO in Sydney, and then a bunch of people spread across various other locations. The key thing for us was just easy, agile collaboration," said LiveTiles chief product officer Simon Tyrrell. Tyrrell told ZDNet that new businesses tend to gravitate towards Amazon and Google, but "they are not built around a partner model". "If you can show Microsoft that you're going to do big things and that you're helping them hit their metrics -- the big ones are the consumption of Azure, consumption of services on Office 365 -- then you can get a lot of support. You can get marketing support, sales support, introductions to very large customers. To have a massive company supporting you like that is a pretty powerful thing to have," Tyrrell said. Now that the business is growing at its fastest rate since inception -- 200 of its 340-plus customers was acquired in the last 12 months alone and subscription revenue quadrupled in 2016 -- investment in robust sales and marketing tools makes a lot more sense, Tyrrell said. The company dipped its toes in Salesforce in the early days, but did not gain much value from it at the time and decided to abandon it. But it has since returned to Salesforce for customer relationship management. LiveTiles was also using Salesforce's marketing automation platform Pardot, but recently transitioned to Marketo as the marketing team believed the latter has more "powerful" features. "A key thing I'd say to any [business] is don't assume you're going to pick the tools today that are going to work for you in six to 12 months time. Try and keep your processes flexible enough that it is not wedded into particular digital tools," Tyrrell said. "If you're successful, if you're growing rapidly, if you're bringing a lot more people on, then you need to be able to adapt to the needs of those people. They might bring expertise in tools that you had never heard of." Tyrrell said his team had tried half a dozen or so product management tools over the years and recently settled on Aha. "As we grew over time, we needed to have much clearer insights, more forward planning, the ability to share [roadmaps] externally with partners and customers, and so that led to a need for a more mature platform," Tyrrell explained. While not all tools used in the past worked out in the long-term, Tyrell said there are no regrets as it's all part of the learning process. Airwallex Lucy Liu, co-founder and COO at Airwallex Image: Supplied Melbourne-based fintech firm Airwallex provides technology that enables cross-border transactions by using machine learning to find the best buy-sell trade for any combination of currencies. For them, finding the right tools to use from the get-go wasn't particularly difficult. This is because the founding team is comprised of technical people, Airwallex co-founder and COO Lucy Liu said. The 18-month-old business is using a range of Atlassian's products including Confluence and Jira, as well as Xero for accounting, and Dropbox and Google for document storage and collaboration. However, given the company operates in both Australia and China, it has had to take into account China's complex internet system and culture, which are underpinned by strict censorship laws. As such, when it comes to cloud hosting, Airwallex has opted for AWS in Australia and AliCloud in China. "AWS doesn't really support China very well because the internet system is very different," Liu told ZDNet. Similarly, communications tools such as Slack or those provided by Google do not work as smoothly in China as it does in Australia, Liu said, so Airwallex is using WeChat for instant messaging and conference calls with Chinese staff. "WeChat is very good for instant communication. It's like WhatsApp. It also has a translation function built into it. But for filtering, finding things, classifying things, managing groups, I think Slack is a lot better. So for document sharing and tracking things, we still use Slack," Liu explained. Liu is particularly fond of a recruitment tool called Laugou, built by a Chinese startup. Likening its design to that of Greenhouse, Liu said Laugou allows companies to track candidates as they progress through the recruitment process. "We don't really have an HR person, so having something where everyone can track candidates on and review CVs is great," Liu said. Liu's three pieces of advice to other businesses when it comes to tooling is: Do your research, trial everything, and sometimes less is more. "Don't get too many tools because it is going to be very overwhelming and hard to manage," Liu said. Airwallex recently raised $13 million from international investors including Mastercard, Sequoia Capital China, and Tencent to accelerate the release of its collection of APIs for businesses looking to process international payments at scale. Sofihub Elizabeth Crooks, client services director at Sofihub Image: Supplied At less than a year old, Melbourne-based startup Sofihub is still early in its journey, even though the technology it will commercially launch in August has been in development for two years at Deakin University. Sofihub's artificial intelligence-powered device uses sensors to learn the normal activities of residents in their homes, which then allows it to detect abnormal activities and alert nominated loved ones and support professionals of potential emergencies. Sofihub can also provide reminders for medication, food, and water intake, as well as important appointments, enabling elderly Australians to live independently at home for longer. Elizabeth Crooks, national client services director at Sofihub, told ZDNet that the startup's first staff member began work in December last year, and the team has since grown to five. However, all staff work from home or at Deakin University, which makes the use of cloud-based tools essential to Sofihub's operations, Crooks said. The "most magical tool keeping [Sofihub] on track" has been Google Hangouts, Crooks admitted, as it supports asynchronous communications in an organised manner and eliminates the need to make disruptive group phone calls. "Effective use of Hangouts means we're all communicating with each other all the time without disturbing each other," she added. "This morning, we received some paperwork for a partnership with a company in Singapore ... They're going to buy 1,000 of our units for a big project. I put that on Google hangouts. Everybody instantly knew, including [Alex Boyd, head of logistics] who knows we need to produce another 1,000 units." The reason for selecting Hangouts over other communications tools, Crooks explained, is simply because Sofihub is "already using Google for everything else, so it just made sense". As a pre-launch and pre-revenue startup, Sofihub has a very lean collection of internal business tools, with legal and accounting tasks being outsourced to individuals or online services. For example, the company has recently been experimenting with contract management tools such as PandaDoc for memorandums of understanding and non-disclosure agreements. Mad Paws Alexis Soulopoulos, co-founder and CEO at Mad Paws Image: Supplied Pet services marketplace Mad Paws, now two and a half years old, is being used by more than 6,000 pet sitters and 100,000-plus pet owners in Australia. Co-founder and CEO of the venture-backed business Alexis Soulopoulos told ZDNet that at the current stage of the company's growth, investing in the right marketing and customer analytics tools is very important. The Sydney-based company initially used MailChimp to send emails to customers, but as its community of pet sitters and owners grew, it needed a tool with additional tracking and reporting capabilities, Soulopoulos said. As such, it switched over from MailChimp to Campaign Monitor and started using Google Analytics. However, Soulopoulos said Mad Paws needed to "get even more granular" and added Mixpanel to its toolbox, which tracks the actions individual visitors take on websites and applications.  It also allows companies to do A/B testing , where they change the colour of a button or the wording in a call-to-action and then measure the impact of those changes. "It's very crucial to understand which customers we are acquiring and what is their behaviour in the long term. If I spend so much money on one customer, I need to know that they're going back to the website at some stage and that they're going to be a profitable customer. I can see things like a user booked us once but then never came back. Maybe we should send another email with the value proposition of why they should use us again and perhaps a discount code," Soulopoulos said. "In a much more powerful way than Google analytics, [Mixpanel] also gives us a very good overview of cohort behaviour -- information like when do people come back and what is the frequency of them coming back. It just provides us with actionable insights into our numbers, into our metrics, on where we can improve." At 18-people strong, Mad Paws is always on the lookout for new talent to bring on board. It is currently using Flare HR, backed by Westpac's venture capital arm Reinventure, for recruitment, onboarding, and employee management. "It's basically free software to manage the HR side of things from job descriptions to onboarding to organising team activities to picking the right t-shirt sizes for staff to setting up the right accesses," Soulopoulos said. Literatu Mark Stanley, founder and CEO at Literatu Image: Supplied Like Sofihub, Literatu's journey also began with Google. The backbone of Literatu's technology -- which allows educators to create interactive activities or assessments, capture and analyse data at the student, classroom, school, and cluster level, and create personalised learning paths -- was initially supported by Google Cloud. However, as the edtech company matured, so had its needs. Literatu, now four years old, eventually migrated to Amazon Web Services (AWS) because they were "outpacing" Google in terms of the capabilities they could provide, according to Mark Stanley, founder and CEO of Literatu. "AWS just make it so simple. They really do. You can turn them on and off in a heartbeat. It's very low cost to get going with AWS. They were just outpacing what we could do with Google," Stanley told ZDNet. "As we grew, we got more entrenched in the bigger services from Amazon such as the Relational Database Service, and then scaling our servers to meet demand at hotspot times. Amazon is really good for that. "It's always about getting the best bang for your buck." But then Literatu began forging ties with Microsoft. As the relationship strengthened, Microsoft began to play an increasingly important role in Literatu's cloud, machine learning, and artificial intelligence strategy. The company, currently armed with more than 120 million data points, is using artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify the best learning experiences for individual students based on their past interactions, as well as predict future performance. Stanley said there were two key reasons for moving Literatu's stack across to Microsoft Azure: The first is that the tech giant provides additional forms of support to startups around marketing and access to enterprise customers; the second is that Microsoft's various platform-as-a-service offerings are a "clear rival" to AWS. "If you just want to put a box into a black space and have it available, they both (Microsoft and AWS) do a really good job. But if you want to talk about leveraging marketing, building a business relationship, Microsoft is definitely a much better option," Stanley said. The edtech business has not completely abandoned its roots; it still uses some of Google's services such as Gmail and Calendar, though AWS is no longer a part of its backbone. Stanley stressed that Literatu has selected cloud-based tools from day one, including GitHub for code base storage, Dropbox for file storage, MYOB for accounting, and Asana for task management. "We always wanted to be in the cloud because it's the safest place to be," Stanley said. While the vendors that Literatu had selected changed over time, Stanley believes they all served their purpose well. Literatu's technology is now being used in more than 1,500 schools around the world, predominantly in Asia, followed by Australia and the US.

There are over a billion WhatsApp users worldwide right now. The bad news? Your mum has already found her new favourite way to spam you. The good news? You can easily avoid her on the down-low, and that’s just one of the messaging service’s many secret tips you probably don’t know about. From disabling its ‘last seen’ feature to bookmarking messages you don’t want to forget about, there are loads of tricks to make your favourite IM app more useful than ever. You just have to be in the know. Luckily enough, we’ve scoured every inch of WhatsApp to gather up its most useful features. Read these top tips and you’ll be a pro in no time at all. 1. BEGONE, BLUE TICKS OF MISERY We know how it is. You're at figure skating practice, your phone buzzes, and you glance down briefly before nailing a spectacular triple axel. Clearly, you've not got time to respond immediately. But at the same time, you don't want the sender to realise that you've already looked at the message, lest they think you're ignoring them when you fail to reply for two more hours. That's the privilege the blue ticks take away. Recently though, the chat app has realised the error of its ways and silently come up with a workaround. The liberty of message-mulling is ours again. How: Users can just access Privacy via Settings and disable Read Receipts. There, now it's time to iron out the kinks in your friendships that the blue ticks have caused. 2. FIGURE OUT YOUR BFFS What’s the difference between a casual acquaintance and a bezzie mate for life? How often you message them on WhatsApp, of course. If you’re not sure how to divvy up the members of your social circle, then why not check how often you’ve messaged them. How: Head to Settings > Data and Storage Usage > Storage Usage and you’ll see a list of your most important groups and contacts ranked according to the data you’ve expended on their behalves. Ah, the romance of modern living. 3. SEE WHEN YOUR MESSAGES ARE READ Think the double-blue ticks are the worst thing to happen to relationships since Tinder? Think again. Here's another way you could annoy your loved ones. In addition to finding out the exact time your messages are delivered, you can also choose to see the exact time your message was read (assuming you choose to stick with the ticks). How: Go to any of your WhatsApp chats, tap and hold on any of the messages you’ve sent in that chat, followed by the Info option. For iOS users, you can also drag towards the left to reveal a window which will show the time your message was delivered and subsequently read. It works for group messages too, with the window listing the time each participant read the message. 4. HIDE YOUR PROFILE PIC Batman. David Bowie. Pepe the Prawn. All people who have built their much-vaunted careers on an air of mystique and otherness. You can bet they’d have their WhatsApp profile pics set to private, instead of treating the world to a bedraggled photo of them and a bottle of Lambrini. So, as the saying goes, always be yourself unless you can be like Batman. How: Head to Settings > Privacy > Profile Photo > Nobody. 5. Mute group chats We’re all in at least a few group chats at any one time, created because someone (likely the group admin) was bored. People tend to get overzealous in chats, especially since WhatsApp allows group conversations of up to 50 participants. Who hasn’t woken up to the horror of 100+ unread messages fuelled by a night of boredom? How: To prevent yourself from being woken up by the constant lighting up of your smartphone screen, you can (a) either flip your phone over and ignore it or (b) mute the offending group chat. Tap on the group chat of your choice, then the name to bring up Group Info where you will find the option to Mute the chat for eight hours to one week or a year. Alternatively, you can exit it altogether. 6. Get shortcuts to conversations If there are certain people you chat to more often, it might be a good idea to create a shortcut for them directly on your homescreen, so you don’t have to keep opening and closing WhatsApp. How: Tap and hold on the chat (group or individual) of your choice and a tab will pop up. Select the Add Conversation Shortcut option and the chat in question will appear as the person's profile photo on your mobile desktop. Unfortunately this only applies for Android users and not iPhone ones. Sorry guys. 7. Find out the truth about where your friend is We've all been a victim of that “on the way” lie when the person in question is still in bed. To prevent yourself from ever getting duped again, insist that the contact shares their current location with you by tapping on the arrow icon next to the text box and then Share Location. There's also a way of preventing them from manually entering their location... How: The way the location appears is a clue. If it’s a real GPS-based location, the location share will appear as a dropped pin, but if it’s a location they entered, its address will appear beside the dropped pin. Feel free to call them out on it. 8. Go incognito by switching off 'last seen' WhatApp’s ‘last seen’ feature is a nightmare for anyone with self-esteem issues. ‘Why are they online and not replying to you right now? Do they have someone more important to be talking to? Surely it’s not Joel? That devilish son of a gun.’ If you’d rather your people didn’t think this way of you, there’s an easy ‘get out of jail’ card to be deployed. Just turn off the ‘last seen’ feature altogether, or restrict it to only your contacts. How: Head to Settings > Privacy > Last Seen > Nobody. 9. Send messages hands-free with Siri Ugh! Typing is a right faff when you want to use your hands for other stuff such as eating, cooking or fine embroidery. Once again WhatsApp has come to the rescue to this most first-world of problems via compatibility with both Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant. So you can now dictate any missives to your phone instead of punching them in with your digits like a total chump. How: Shout out ‘Hey Siri’ or ‘OK Google’, then name the contact you want to send a message to and the contents of that message. 10. Send public messages privately If you’ve got a generic announcement to make - an invite to a weekend BBQ or an intervention about your friend's unhealthy obsession with KFC - and you don’t want to do it on the loudmouth platform that is Facebook, this feature works in pretty much the same way as BCC-ing people in an email. Your recipients will get the message as if it was a privately composed one, oblivious to the fact that you’ve sent the exact same invite to 342 other people. Sincerity? What's that? How: On the top-left-hand corner of your WhatsApp Chats window, just below the search bar, you’ll notice a Broadcast Lists. Tap on it for the option to create a new list of contacts you want your message to go out to, and message away like you would normally. 11. Stay selectively notified Not all group chats are created equal, as some are filled with nothing but white noise. And it’s exactly those group chats you want to ignore until you get some downtime to sieve through everything that’s been said. On the flipside, there are the group chats you want to stay on top of, such as the ones deciding dinner plans for the night and so on. Here’s how you can stay selectively notified. How: Go to the significant group chats, tap on the name to bring up Group Info and then Custom Notifications. There, you can select a custom message alert for the group chats of your choice. All you have to do now is remember which alert tone you assigned to which group chat. This customisation is only applicable for group chats though. 12. Back it up Worried about losing a year’s worth of messages? You don’t have to. WhatsApp knows how precious your chat history is to you and secures it all for you in the cloud. How: iPhone users get the option of backing their chat history to iCloud automatically on a daily/weekly/monthly schedule. If it’s only selected chat histories you desire, click on the chat you want, then the user’s name and finally email conversation to yourself. Android users can go to 'Settings', 'Chats and calls', and select the 'Chat backup' option, which will let you setup an automatic Google Drive backup. The next time you install WhatsApp from fresh on any device, you can simply select the Google Drive backup option at the setup screen, to have all your up-to-date messages injected into your device, straight from the cloud. 13. Save your media (and data allowance) When you’re on a 1GB data plan, every MB counts. You don’t want to be slapped with a hefty bill at the end of the month from sending stupid shareable memes and screenshots of every little thing. There’s a way to make sure that all that heavy-duty image sending won’t eat up what little complimentary data you might have in your plan. How: Go to Settings, then Chat Settings and then Auto-Download and tweak the settings for how you want your received media to be downloaded. Choose Wi-Fi if you don’t want to overload your data plan. Alternatively, you can trigger downloads manually by switching Auto-Download to Never. You can also save the hassle of having to clean up your camera roll every so often by tweaking Save Incoming Media off. 14. Tie the app to your number If you’re overseas and you get a new data sim, there’s no need to go through the hassle of registering the new number attached to the SIM and faff around adding contacts. Just carry on using WhatsApp with your regular number. How: When you put your new SIM in and activate WhatsApp, you’ll be prompted by the messaging service to register the new number. But doing so will mess up your contacts list. Just ignore the pop-up or cancel it, and your WhatsApp should work linked to your old number, while using your new data SIM. 15. Star messages When dinner time rolls around, the last thing you want to do is scroll through 352 frivolous messages to find the address of the restaurant you're meeting your friends at. Luckily WhatsApp lets you bookmark certain messages for easy access. How: Double tap on any message and tap on the star icon to mark it. To find it again, all you have to do is tap on the chat’s name, and tap on Starred Messages to see all the messages you’ve marked out. To see conversation context, just tap on the arrow next to it and you’ll be brought back to the exact place in the chat. When you’re done with it, just double tap the message, and hit the star icon again to unstar it. It’s only available for iOS users for now, so fandroids, wait your turn. 16. Make calls WhatsApp is more than just a run-of-the-mill instant messenger. You can use it to make calls too. How: Make sure you're using the latest version of WhatsApp. You should see a new Calls tab alongside the usual Chats and Contacts. Just send a voice call invite to another WhatsApp user and you'll be chatting away in no time. 17. Instantly add dates to your calendar It’s easy to forget appointments when you’re a busy bee. You make vague plans for drinks, settle on a date, then promptly forget about it as the conversation rolls on. This handy little shortcut makes sure you commit to an appointment. How: Just state a date and you get an automatic link to add it to your calendar. It also recognises words like ‘today’, ‘tomorrow’ and days. But it's still best to use specific dates, just in case you get the day wrong. No more excuses for forgetting drink dates anymore, then. At least, not for iOS users. Android users have to wait a little while longer we're afraid. 18. Use Whatsapp on the web WhatsApp Web is the best creation since...WhatsApp itself. It’s not an entirely new feature (as any smug Android user will tell you), but their gloating days are over, as it's now available on iOS too. How: To enable inconspicuous chatting on the web while you do your work, all you have to do is go to Settings and tap on WhatsApp Web. Then head to web.whatsapp.com on your computer and scan the QR code that appears using your phone. Commence chatting on the sly without downloading anything. Handy, and also very, very distracting. 19. Save data on calls Making calls via WhatsApp is a very convenient feature, but it can also consume a lot of data. Thankfully, there's a new option to help those of us with data shortage problems. How: Pop into Settings then Chats and Calls. Right at the bottom, you’ll find Low Data Usage. Turn that on to decrease the amount of data used during calls made via WhatsApp. We’d still advise using WhatsApp calls sparingly on data if you’re on a limited data plan, but you can still save on calls when connected to Wi-Fi abroad. 20. Locate group chat You can find old group chats by searching for individual members that were in the chat group, rather than the group name itself. This is useful for when you want to revisit old topics, as chances are you'll remember who was in the chat, more than the hilarious bants-laden group name that seemed so funny at the time. How: Just tap on any individual chats, and tap their name for more information. From there you’ll be able to see all the groups you have in common with said individual, even if they go way back. 21. Back up everything including video There was a time when you could only backup images in your chats, but not videos. Now that’s changed. How: Get into Settings, then Chats and Calls, and pop into Chat Backup. This is the control centre for backing up your wordy memories. You can choose when you want Auto Backup to happen (but make sure you disable backing up using data within your phone’s settings or there will be hell to pay). You can also choose to include videos in your backup by toggling Include Videos. Would it be greedy of us to ask for voice messages to be included in the next update too? 22. Visual reminders Have the habit of reading messages then forgetting to reply to them? Now you have no excuse to neglect them as there's a new Mark as unread feature which lets you mark chats with a blue dot so that you can come back to them later. How: Just swipe any of your chats to the right and the option to Mark as unread will show up. Tap on it and a blue dot will appear on the chat as a visual marker. Once you’re done with it, just swipe the chat to the right to unmark it. Simple. P.S. Android users can achieve the same thing by long-pressing on a chat. 23. Stop people from accidentally reading your messages Theoretically, all messages on WhatsApp are private - but not when you leave your phone on the table, and a new message notification pops up. How many times have you unintentionally read someone’s message just because you’ve curiously looked over when their phone screen blinked to life with a new message notification? Admit it, we’ve all done it, and sometimes read something we've regretted. How: Go to Settings, then Notifications, and disable Show Preview. Now you can gossip in peace, without anyone accidentally reading your conversations by glancing casually at your phone when a notification comes in. Your notification still reveals who has just messaged you, without divulging any of its super secret contents. 24. Reply directly from a popup Oh, new message! Swipe down the notification bar, tap the message and reply. Sounds simple, right? It is, but there's an even faster way - cut to the chase and reply directly from a notification. How: Go to Settings, Notifications, then Popup Notification, and choose from four different options. You can change this setting for both individual messages and group messages respectively. Unfortunately, this feature is only available for Android. For now, anyway. 25. Send an attachment Unlike EPMD’s hip-hop classic, WhatsApp’s ethos is by no means Strictly Business. If you do need to quickly send a document to a colleague, and email isn’t an option, it’s easily done. Just select the file you want from Google Drive, Dropbox or iCloud and WhatsApp will fling it onwards as a pdf. How: Tap the + symbol > Document > select your cloud storage service of choice and then the file itself. Bosh!

Linux, Android, and Blackberry's QNX race for control of car infotainment systems. Ron Amadeo (US) - May 21, 2017 8:15 am UTC reader comments 193 Share this story If I asked you "how many computing devices do you own?" your mind will probably first jump to your PCs and laptops at home, and then to your smartphones and tablets. The more tech savvy might include smartwatches, TVs, and video game systems. But there's one computing device that not many people think about as a computing device: the car infotainment system. Like everything else, infotainment systems are computers with processors, operating systems, and applications, but you won't find much material out there that treats them as such. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Samsung, and others hold big press conferences about their new hardware and software, touting ever-larger spec sheets, new features, and universally known sub-brands like iPhone, Surface, and Galaxy. But you'll almost never see car companies announce how much RAM is in their new car infotainment systems, though; most won't speak a word about specs or even say what software they're running. Sure, the main purpose of a car is to drive it, so horsepower, safety, and comfort are top-of-mind. But after the steering wheel, pedals, and (for some drivers) the turn signal, the infotainment system is one of the most-used interfaces of a car. If it sucks, you're probably going to be unhappy. So today we're going to treat car computers like every other kind of computer and see how car companies are adapting to the age of the smartphone. Consumers are demanding ever-more-complicated tech packages in their cars, and some members of the 100-year-old car industry are adapting to it better than others. The state of the car computer. Welcome to the infotainment Wild West In the early days of the PC, there were lots of operating systems—DOS, Mac OS, OS/2, Windows, BeOS, AmigaOS, and others. Eventually, the platform matured, and things settled out to (mostly) a duopoly of OSes—Microsoft's Windows and Apple's macOS. In the early days of smartphones, there were lots of operating systems—Palm OS, Windows Mobile, Symbian, BlackBerry OS, Brew, and others. Eventually, the platform matured, and things settled out to (mostly) a duopoly of OSes—Google's Android and Apple's iOS. It is with this in mind that we look at the current state of the car computer, where we definitely seem to be in the "early" days. Today, there is no shortage of car OSes, all of which are heavily customised by and exclusive to each car manufacturer. For general underlying operating systems, we've got Blackberry's QNX, Microsoft's Windows Embedded Automotive, plenty of custom Linux-based OSes, and plenty of custom Android Open Source Project (AOSP)-based OSes, which itself is Linux-based. Car companies usually build custom interfaces on top of these OSes and brand them as productions of the car company, with names like "Ford Sync" and "Audi MMI." Of the "big three" consumer operating system companies—Microsoft, Google, and Apple—only Microsoft currently competes in the automotive OS market. Apple and Google both have "projected" car interfaces—CarPlay and Android Auto, respectively. But these are merely run from a smartphone and are sent to the car display. They are not real operating systems and essentially run as apps on top of one of the previously named car OSes. There's also the similar "MirrorLink" system, which—with a compatible car and phone—will send your entire phone display to the car screen. Microsoft has had a car platform seemingly forever, starting with the (aftermarket) Windows CE 2.0-based "Auto PC" in 1998. Microsoft's car platform (which, in typical Microsoft fashion, has changed names about five times over the years) had a serious foothold in the market with Ford Sync. But after Ford switched to Blackberry's QNX, many wondered if Microsoft has a future in the infotainment market. The company recently signed a deal with Renault-Nissan, but it's too early for any real products yet. Further ReadingGoogle shows off its car infotainment operating system, built into Android NSeveral cars today run Google's operating system, Android, but everything you see out there is an AOSP (Android Open Source Project) derivative created without Google's involvement. While the Google-less Android distributions proliferate, Google is working on copying its smartphone strategy over to the automotive market. Google's "Open Handset Alliance" is a group of smartphone OEMs that have committed themselves to using Google-blessed Android distributions. The car-focused version of this group, the "Open Automotive Alliance" already counts 50 car brands (heavily inflated from badge engineering) as members. These members sign contracts promising to follow Google's Android compatibility requirements, and we've already seen car-specific language (see: "Android Automotive") start to pop up in Google's compatibility docs. At trade shows, Google has shown off two separate Android car OS concepts: one with a Google-designed interface, which would be similar to a "Pure Google" Pixel phone, and one that has been skinned with a custom interface from Fiat-Chrysler, which is similar to what Android smartphone partners like Samsung and LG do. The whole concept is an exact copy of Google's smartphone strategy. But how many car manufacturers will look at the smartphone market and be willing to actually ship a Google car OS? Further ReadingOne week with Apple’s CarPlayAs for Apple—if the company follows its usual strategy of vertical hardware and software integration, it would only produce a car OS if it also produced a car. As farfetched as that may seem, rumors claim Apple has had an autonomous electric car project in the works since 2014 called "Project Titan." According to The New York Times, the 1,000-person-strong Project Titan team has undergone a "reboot" recently, which involved some layoffs. Apparently the group is pivoting away from designing a car and more toward "building out the underlying technology for an autonomous vehicle." So CarPlay seems like it will be the company's in-car solution for the foreseeable future. Enlarge / This "Auto Manufacturer market share" chart also works as a rough "Car operating system market share" chart. It's actually worse than this, since some car manufacturers have multiple OSes. Good luck, developers. Good Car Bad Car / Ron Amadeo With the big consumer software vendors on the sidelines, we have a situation that looks a lot like the pre-iOS/pre-Android days. Every automaker is building a car OS that is incompatible with every other car OS, so "Car OS app stores" are not really a thing. The market is a nightmare for app developers, and, at best in a car, you'll get a single-digit lineup of packed-in apps—and that's it. For a look at what wide car support in 2017 looks like, check out Pandora's insane "How to listen to Pandora in the car" support page, which lists all of its disparate pack-in clients. Between car manufacturers and aftermarket stereos, Pandora lists 33 different brands that have the Pandora app. Some of those car brands are owned by a single company and share an infotainment platform, and Pandora can probably share some code across certain versions. But the company is still looking at something like 20 clients that are all somehow different. A big reason any OS market usually coalesces from many operating systems to a small handful of options is because of app developers. Before the Android/iOS duopoly in smartphones, Google CEO Larry Page once complained his company had "a closet full of over 100 phones" just to maintain the Google mobile apps, and the company was "building our software pretty much one device at a time." With the car infotainment market in pretty much the same state today, Pandora must need a garage full of cars to maintain its car app. For most third-party developers, duplicating Pandora's herculean car app development efforts is financially impossible. So apps just don't get made. The other problem with car computers is age. Designing a car computer is much more complex than building a desktop, laptop, or smartphone. The biggest problem—one that you'll need to consider over and over again when you see the choices that car manufacturers make—is that designing and releasing a car takes about three to five years. This means that every computing component is going to be a bit old, and no one has figured out how to put cutting-edge computing parts into a car. Meanwhile, the need to comply with safety regulations from government groups all around the world is a lengthy process that contributes to the pokey rollout of technology. Keep in mind that, while history shows the original iPhone kicking off the modern touchscreen smartphone revolution 10 years ago, it was initially met with lots of skepticism. So in addition to the three- to five-year turnaround time, you also have to factor in when each individual car manufacturer realised iPhone-style smartphones were the future. As a result, most car companies are only on their second-generation interface. With the basics set up, let's take a look at some of the individual car infotainment systems that are out there.

So what does the social network want with all our boring videos? Colin Horgan May 18, 2017 Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   A collage of images sourced from public videos on Facebook Live. In January, a group of four teenagers in Chicago kidnapped and abused a mentally disabled man. They broadcast the entire awful incident live—via Facebook. Later that month, a 14-year old girl in Miami took her own life while also broadcasting on Facebook Live. A friend who reportedly saw the video called police. Then, in April, Steve Stephens recorded himself shooting and killing an innocent elderly man, Robert Godwin Sr., in Cleveland. Stephens did not actually broadcast the murder live on Facebook, but uploaded it there after the fact. Still, initial reports that he had filmed it live became part of the narrative nonetheless. Stephens eventually killed himself (away from cameras). Less than two weeks later, a 22-year old Thai man named Wuttisan Wongtalay did broadcast via Facebook Live as he hanged his 11-month old daughter, and then took his own life. The girl’s mother, who was scrolling through Facebook at the time, saw it happening and alerted authorities. Faced with public backlashes following these horrific news stories, and in an attempt to refocus the narrative surrounding its live broadcasting feature, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced the company will add 3,000 more staff members to respond to user content alerts, and take action should anything gruesome occur. Of course, day to day, Facebook Live is not replete with those sorts of videos; most feature far more benign subject matter. So, what will those 3,000 extra Facebook souls see, if not disturbing images? READ MORE: The case for pressing pause on Facebook Live At any time on Facebook, hundreds, maybe thousands, are inviting the world to watch them in real time. If they’re not doing something that catches the attention of Facebook’s content control managers, how are they using Facebook Live? Or, perhaps, how is it using them? Recently, I spent a day watching nine hours worth of Facebook Live videos, trying to find out. It’s not difficult to do — Facebook created a global map upon which tiny blue dots light up whenever someone begins broadcasting live; all you have to do to watch is click the dot. And although I discovered the content of most Facebook Live videos is overwhelmingly banal, it raises the question: what does Facebook really want with all our boring videos?   Boys in Pakistan play cricket. Gif via Facebook Live.   Over the course of my nine hours watching well over a hundred Facebook Live videos, I watched: boys in Pakistan playing cricket; a bartender mixing drinks at a cocktail competition in Spain; a martial arts class in Japan; a family eating dinner at a restaurant in South Korea; a woman in Thailand dancing to Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling”; a young man driving a truck down Highway 401 in Ontario while listening to music; a dog giving birth to puppies in Edmonton; and a man in the Bronx who, before exiting the frame for a while, had been painting a wall white, leaving behind a literal live feed of paint beginning to dry. Mixed in were videos of more significance—or, at least, more news. Given that I was watching Facebook Live on the day following Emmanuel Macron’s election as France’s new president, I also saw a live feed of left-wing protesters gathering to hear speeches before they marched through the streets of Paris. A short time later, New York Times columnist Roger Cohen was also broadcasting live from Paris, as he chatted with voters about the previous day’s election result. About 20 minutes later, I briefly watched U.K. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speak live at the University of Warwick. U.K. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks to a crowd at the University of Warwick. Gif via Facebook Live/imgflip.com At one point, I checked in on something called DreamHack Counter-Strike Live, a stream of a gaming competition that was being watched simultaneously by a theatre full of people in real life, and by approximately 1,300 more online. Even more joined me in watching a small-time American right-wing talking head, Harlan Hill, bloviate live in front of a laptop on a channel run by Dennis Michael Lynch Media. Somewhere north of 2,000 watched that—a viewership figure not all that uncommon in the increasingly internet-centric, niche right wing media world—just a smattering of those who have taken advantage of Facebook’s free platform and reach to create media channels. That kind of usage is in line with Facebook’s plan. “Historically, Facebook has seen itself as a distribution platform, or almost a social utility, comparable to email or phone or text,” says Antonio García Martínez, author of Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley, who served as an ads product manager at Facebook for several years. That idea sits in the subtext of a post by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, published the day Facebook Live became available to all. “When you interact live, you feel connected in a more personal way,” he wrote in April 2016. Facebook Live is “a big shift in how we communicate, and it’s going to create new opportunities for people to come together.” For awhile, this shift seemed not only true, but also positive – if not downright fun. Two days after Zuckerberg’s post, BuzzFeed live-streamed two employees gradually wrapping increasing numbers of elastic bands around the centre of a watermelon until it exploded. That video has been watched over 11 million times. A month later, Facebook Live scored an even bigger viral moment, when Candace Payne excitedly broadcast from a parking lot that she’d bought a new toy—not for her kids, but for herself. It was a Chewbacca mask that emitted the Wookiee’s tell-tale call every time Payne opened her mouth to speak or laugh. It was an instant sensation. The “Chewbacca Mom” video has been seen over 160 million times—though many of those views were not live. Then, in July 2016, Diamond Reynolds used Facebook Live to broadcast the moments after a police officer fatally shot her boyfriend, Philando Castile, after the pair had been pulled over. Through shocking, the existence of the video evidence was considered overall to be positive: a new kind of transparency on police action in the U.S. Then came 2017, and with it, a different kind of horror. Still, the way Facebook Live has been adopted for good and ill speaks—rather darkly—to Facebook’s success in positioning itself as a public utility. READ MORE: Should Facebook tell you more about political ads? “The reality is that any technology… once it gets used by the sort of criminal class, then you know it’s for real. Your product has succeeded, you’ve gone from being some consumer product, capital letter T-M, to a utility that everyone uses,” García Martínez says. “It’s embarrassing as hell, but at the end of the day, that livestream is a success as a product. I’m having this incredible emotional moment and avenging myself in some criminal way, and if my first stop is ‘oh, let’s use Facebook Live,’–like, that’s the way I declare it to the world—I mean, y’know, you’ve made it as a product.”   Candace Payne, aka ‘Chewbacca Mom’, shows off her new mask on Facebook Live May 19, 2016. Screenshot via Facebook Live.   Unless it has been promoted by a media outlet or happens to have gone viral somehow, only a handful of people are watching the majority of Facebook Live videos in real time. Even after they’re posted to the videographer’s Facebook wall, viewership will likely remain very low. In some instances, videos that were at one time live are deleted by their creators; unless you saw the livestream, you’ll never see that video. Most of us simply don’t have time to waste on Facebook Live videos, live or on replay. Still, someone—or something—has to monitor this stuff. Hence, those 3,000 new Facebook hires “to review the millions of reports we get every week, and improve the process for doing it quickly,” as Zuckerberg wrote. The new hires join a team of 4,500 content monitors. There are two points we should consider as Facebook brings on more people, says García Martínez. One is that even with more eyeballs, Facebook’s human staff can’t see everything; the second is that, for a company of Facebook’s size, 3,000 is quite a few. “Facebook could hire 300,000 people and it wouldn’t be enough to look at every video. There’s absolutely no way a human is looking at every video,” says García Martínez, whose ads team was also required to monitor content to ensure it did not violate Facebook’s terms. For live video, that includes some types of nudity, hate speech, and violent or graphic content. On Sunday, the Guardian reported on leaked rules for moderators at Facebook. “Videos of violent deaths, while marked as disturbing, do not always have to be deleted because they can help create awareness of issues such as mental illness,” the Guardian reported, based on the content of the leaked documents. Those documents also show that Facebook will “allow people to livestream attempts to self-harm because it ‘doesn’t want to censor or punish people in distress,’” the Guardian said. READ MORE: The problem with Facebook’s plan to teach you how to read news Still, that does not mean these videos aren’t being reported and assessed. Facebook’s 3,000 new hires are not merely a public relations exercise, García Martínez says. Their presence is a way to expand Facebook’s whack-a-mole approach to offensive or disturbing material reported by users. “If you imagine it being a funnel and millions, if not billions, of videos are going into the funnel, [the extra employees] sort of expands the base of the funnel in terms of how many videos they can possibly look at or how many videos they can take a closer look at.” And though the number of new hires may seem insignificant against the sheer volume of video, they are still meaningful, he says. “Facebook isn’t actually that big a company when you compare it to Google or Microsoft, and these are all going to be operations people which Facebook doesn’t like to manage. So to them, hiring 3,000 ops people is actually kind of a big step,” says García Martínez. “I think it should be taken seriously.”   A bus parks in Japan. Screenshot via Facebook Live.   Perhaps the best way to understand what role Facebook could play in our future is to not think of it as a social media company at all—or even a media company—but instead as a company that develops artificial intelligence. What becomes immediately clear after watching a litany of Facebook Live videos is Facebook’s real “connection” is not really between two people, but between one person and a screen. The humans who use Facebook Live are not teaching each other about humanity as much as they are teaching a computer program about it. Facebook, like many others, is hard at work developing machine learning, which involves feeding computers huge quantities of information so they can see and ‘learn’ patterns. This is how computers are increasingly carrying out image analysis, wherein a computer program will not only be able to distinguish between objects in a photo or scene, but identify each separate item. To do that, researchers need to create something called “deep convolutional neural networks” that can automatically deduce—hence, machine learning — “patterns from millions of annotated examples, and having seen a sufficient number of such examples start to generalize to novel images.” It’s a kind of layered network that is trained to answer ever more abstract yes-no questions as it examines an image—starting with something as simple as whether or not there IS an object in an image at all—to eventually, after some refinement, picking out and identifying each image’s disparate parts. MORE: An interview with Geoffrey Hinton, the godfather of ‘neural network’ AI In April 2016, the head of Facebook’s Applied Machine Learning, Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, told Popular Science the company was still trying to get its algorithms to identify where images are in photos—something called “semantic segmentation.” That is, the program doesn’t just know that an item is present in the image, but how it is oriented. In February, Candela gave an update: Facebook has developed a way for users to search for a photo simply by typing in a description of what’s in it. This advancement, Candela wrote, helps with things like image description for the visually impaired. “Until recently, these captions described only the objects in the photo,” Candela wrote. As of the update, Facebook has added twelve actions “so image descriptions will now include things like ‘people walking,’ ‘people dancing,’ ‘people riding horses,’ ‘people playing instruments,’ and more.” How did they do it? Facebook built on its Lumos platform, a computer vision platform for the visually impaired. They then curated 130,000 public Facebook photos that included people, had “human annotators” write one-line descriptions and then “leveraged these annotations to build a machine-learning model that can seamlessly infer actions of people in photos.” Facebook has already started to apply the same thinking to video in the hopes of perfecting it there, too. As with live broadcasting, Facebook is not at the forefront of this kind of thing; Google Photos has had something similar for a while, but it lacks the deep-rooted veins of a billion-user social network. A man in Germany is filmed vacuuming on Facebook Live. Gif via Facebook Live/imgflip.com The day a machine watches you in much the same way a human can is tantalizingly—or worryingly—close, depending on your perspective. A few weeks after Facebook announced its Lumos update, Candela spoke with Steven Levy, the editor of Backchannel. He told Levy there are four areas in which A.I. is applicable: vision, language, speech, and camera effects. “All of those, he says, will lead to a ‘content understanding engine,’ ” Levy wrote. “By figuring out how to actually know what content means, Facebook intends to detect subtle intent from comments, extract nuance from the spoken word, identify faces of your friends that fleetingly appear in videos, and interpret your expressions and map them onto avatars in virtual reality sessions.” In March, Google announced it had found a way to teach its computers to interpret video content without manual tagging. Google can also pinpoint when that content appears in the video. “For example, searching for ‘tiger’ would find all precise shots containing tigers across a video collection in Google Cloud Storage,” Google said. And in November, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced they’d created an A.I. system that, when given a still image from a video, could predict what might happen in the next few frames. Could A.I. interpret video as it watches thousands of live videos in real-time? Yes, says Sanja Fidler, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto who works in the field of computer vision. Someday—and probably soon. “In the end, if you have a lot of labelled data, you can start training these algorithms to do this for you,” she says. A program may be able to recognize, for instance, whether someone is at the beach, or in an urban environment, or what store someone is standing in. “You could start reading this from the actual videos. You can start analyzing the behaviour of people, which is not what you’re getting from images.” An algorithm is already at work recognizing disturbing content, perhaps explaining why I saw none in my one-day experiment. No doubt, questions of content allowance—what qualifies as “pornography,” for instance—will arise, just as they did when Facebook removed the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1972 photo of a young naked Vietnamese girl fleeing an American napalm drop. Just as likely, however, will be questions about behavioural analysis.   The aftermath of a hotel fire in Geneva, Switzerland is broadcast on Facebook Live. Screenshot via Facebook Live.   When a Facebook Live broadcast is over, “the video will be published to the Page or profile so that fans and friends who missed it can watch at a later time,” Facebook says in its FAQ page. “The broadcaster can remove the video post at any time, just like any other post.” But just because something has disappeared from a user’s Facebook wall—just because nobody will ever see it—doesn’t mean it’s gone. The control we feel over the content we create is somewhat deceiving. Anyone who has ever downloaded their Facebook history knows that, no matter what you’ve chosen to delete or make private, Facebook remembers. “They are storing this data, they are processing this data,” Fidler says. Facebook warns its users of this fact in its terms of service, likening the deletion process to “emptying the recycling bin on a computer… the removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable amount of time.” READ MORE: The dark irony behind Facebook’s fake news problem I asked Facebook whether it permanently stores videos, or whether they are deleted permanently once they’re removed from a user’s wall. I asked Facebook what data it collects from Facebook Live videos, or from accounts belonging those watching. And I asked Facebook how it uses the data collected from a Live video. Facebook answered all three questions by providing a link to its data privacy page. There is a push in Europe to force Facebook to change the way it collects and shares. Last week, both French and Dutch officials said the site “had not provided people in their countries with sufficient control over how their details are used,” the New York Times reported. France fined Facebook €150,000 ($227,000) for failing to meet privacy protection rules in that country. However, in just over a year, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect, and, under those new rules, tech companies could be fined as much as €20 million ($30.3 million), or four per cent of company revenue—whichever is higher. Which means, in Europe—unless Facebook finds a way around the new rules—shareable personal details could become very limited indeed. In the U.S., there is an attempt to extend privacy rules that now apply to internet service providers to Facebook and Google, meaning they would need user permission before sharing things like browsing history with advertisers. However, that bill has a distance to go before passing. In the meantime, Facebook forges ahead, and the consequences of its technological prowess, coupled with its global reach could be considerable. Currently, via your online behaviour, Facebook understands what you’re like on the internet. It knows the websites you visit, the pages you like, your political affiliation, where you live. Via the photos you share and the posts you write, it probably knows a fair bit about how you spend your time offline, too. Facebook might know where you like to go on vacation, and maybe where you work. It probably knows which friends on your list you actually spend time with and talk to. It might even know what your children look like, and what park they visit. Live video could tell Facebook a lot more. What happens when Facebook Live’s built-in video scanning A.I. can tell what brand of sofa you own and clothing you wear? Or whether you’re pregnant? Better yet, what happens when A.I. understands not just the topic of live human conversation, but its content? Most of that data might still not have what García Martínez calls “commercial value.” Your drunken party conversation or lip-sync to Justin Timberlake might not tell Facebook anything more about you than it already knows. But live video may be more telling of human intent, emotion, or desire than anything any of us would write in a post or message, or reveal in a photograph. At the moment, for instance, when Facebook’s A.I. examines a video, it can’t judge honesty; it cannot distinguish whether your rant about a product or political party is sincere or mocking, or whether your smile in a photo is genuine. An algorithm cannot yet scan live video footage and tell if we’re lying. What happens when it can?   A man sits in a pub in North Yorkshire, U.K. Screenshot via Facebook Live.   “How has it come to this? How has it come to this? It’s twenty past six on a Monday night, and I’m in the pub and I’m pissed.” A man named Alex, whose public profile page says he lives in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, U.K., is indeed sitting in a pub on a Monday evening. He lounges in front of a window, wearing a toque. He occasionally takes a drag from his vaper. Alex chats idly about getting “a vindaloo later.” At this point, he has one viewer: me. “Facebook Live, what a fantastic invention that was,” Alex says. “So, who are you, one viewer? Who is it?” Alex picks up the phone. The camera faces the skylight above him, he is cast in silhouette. “Who is it? Who is it? I don’t know how to use this, I haven’t got a clue.” I sit silently at my computer in Toronto, watching. It is just Alex and I. In some ways, this is just like television—a camera over there feeding to a screen over here—just taken to a banal extreme. But there is one crucial difference: most of the time, Alex doesn’t look directly at the camera, and thus not directly at me; instead, he looks at his phone’s display—the mirrored reflection of himself. Moments pass. Eventually, some people listed as Alex’s friends on his profile are alerted to his livestream and start to leave comments; questions about his car and the music playing in the background. In all, Alex is live for just under a half hour, after which he starts a new livestream. What did I learn about Alex in those few minutes? He mentioned a few details about his life beyond the pub, including a long diatribe about what menu items he enjoys at a local Indian restaurant that also allows customers to bring their own alcohol. Inconsequential details I will soon forget. In a near future, when Facebook’s machine learning is perfected, it may learn the same few things about Alex that I did, understand the same words and context, and, like me, internalize them for later use. Unlike me, Facebook won’t forget.   A ladder sits in a room in the Bronx, New York. Screenshot via Facebook Live.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us More Android Go details come to light after announcement By Ida Torres - May 21, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter One of the bigger announcements at the recently-concluded Google I/O was Android Go. But while the project sounded exciting, it also caused a lot of confusion, particularly since there wasn’t a lot of official information available at the Google online properties. Gadgets 360 was able to interview Sameer Samat, VP of Product Management for Android and Google Play and the man who introduced Android Go on stage, to clarify some things that have been going around. First of all, Android Go isn’t even a real name as it is an internal project name within the company. But why they introduced the name at Google I/O where they know people will probably use this as an official name is anyone’s guess. It is also not a new version of Android but rather several presets that Android O will be shipping with devices that have a low RAM. The OEM will choose to turn on the Go configuration in place for devices that have 1GB RAM and may not be optimized to run all different kinds of apps when they’re on their “regular” configuration. For example, several animations within the system will be turned off since those are usually memory intensive. Google is also working on creating low RAM versions of several of their apps, similar to what they have done with YouTube Go. They will also be adding features, not necessarily just removing them. For example, data management is important for lower end devices so they are adding that to quick settings. Users of the devices that will run the Go configuration can still opt to install the regular versions of apps and those who don’t have Go on their devices can also install the less memory intensive version of the apps which they can find on Google Play Store, regardless if their smartphone is high-end or lower end. However the configuration will be coming out with new devices by 2018 and so you won’t see it on your already existing device.

Both are voice-activated speakers that can handle a bit of your life admin, giving you a calendar update or keeping track of your shopping list. But now they can talk to each other — and they get along — so I'm not sure how long it'll take until they realise that they should just team up and kill all humans. This little Easter egg introduces the two, with only a bit of meatbag human kick-starting needed — "OK Google, say hi to Alexa" — and the rest is history. The quickly ending history of the human race, that is, as Google's Assistant and Alexa quickly form a fast friendship. Listening to the two of them talk it's pretty clear that Google Home is a millenial, and Alexa is a mum. They both get along pretty well, though, despite their difference in maturity. Now we just need to get both of them in Australia. Working fully, at least.

In the AI wars, Microsoft now has the clearer vision Posted 5 hours ago by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Gillmor Gang: Binge & Purge A week ago, Microsoft held its Build developer conference in its backyard in Seattle. This week, Google did the same in an amphitheater right next to its Mountain View campus. While Microsoft’s event felt like it embodied the resurgence of the company under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Google I/O — and especially its various, somewhat scattershot keynotes — fell flat this year. The two companies have long been rivals, of course, but now — maybe more than ever — they are on a collision course that has them compete in cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, productivity applications and virtual and augmented reality. It’s fascinating to compare Pichai’s and Nadella’s keynote segments. Both opened their respective shows. But while Pichai used his time mostly to announce new stats and a new product or two, Nadella instead used his time on stage to talk about the opportunities and risks of the inevitable march of technological progress that went way beyond saying that his company is now ‘AI first.’ “Let us use technology to bring more empowerment to more people,” Nadella said of one of the core principles of what he wants his company to focus on. “When we have these amazing advances in computer vision, or speech, or text understanding — let us use that to bring more people to use technology and to participate economically in our society.” And while Google mostly celebrated itself during its main I/O keynote, Nadella spent a good chunk of time during his segment on celebrating and empowering developers in a way that felt very genuine. Having spent a few days at both events, I couldn’t help coming home thinking that it may be Microsoft that has the more complete vision for this AI-first world we’ll soon live in — and if Google has it, it didn’t do a good job articulating it at I/O this year. AI First The area where this rivalry is most obvious (outside of the core cloud computing services) is in machine learning. Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted during his keynote segment that the company is moving from being a mobile first company to an AI first one. Microsoft is essentially on the same path, even as its CEO Satya Nadella phrased it differently. Neither company really mentioned the other during its keynote events, but the parallels here are pretty clear. The two marquee products both companies used to show off their AI prowess were surprisingly similar. For Microsoft, that was Story Remix, a very nifty app that automatically makes interesting home videos our of your photos and videos. For Google, it was Google Photos, which is using its machine learning tech to help you share your best photos more easily. Remix is a far more fun and interesting product, which garnered massive applause from the developer audience at Build, while the new Google Photos features sound useful enough, but aren’t going to blow people away. There was also nothing developers could learn from that segment. Google Lens, which can identify useful information in images, looks like it could be really useful, too (though we won’t really know until we get our hands on it at some point in the future), but it’s worth noting that Google’s presentation wasn’t very clear here and that a number of people I talked to after the event told me that they had a hard time figuring out whether this was a developer tool, a built-in feature for the Google Assistant or a standalone app. That’s never a good sign. Google also still offers Google Goggles, an app that allowed you to identify objects around you for a few years now. I think Google forgot that even existed, as it’s sometimes prone to do. At the core of the two companies’ AI efforts for consumers are Microsoft Cortana and the Google Assistant. This is one area where Google remains clearly ahead of Microsoft, simply because it offers more hardware surfaces for accessing it and because it knows more about the user (and the rest of the world). Cortana works well enough, but because it mostly lives on the desktop and isn’t really connected to the rest of your devices, using it never comes natural. In the virtual personal assistant arena, Google actually had some interesting announcements (though things like making calls on Google Home fell a bit flat, too, simply because Amazon announced this same feature for its Echo speakers a few days earlier). The fact that it is coming to the iPhone shows that Google wants it to be a cross-platform service and its integration with Chromecast is also really interesting (but again, because Amazon already announced its version of the Echo with a built-in screen, this didn’t land with the big splash Google had surely hoped for either). None of the new Assistant features are available now, which is disappointing and follows an unfortunate trend for Google I/O announcements in recent years. With the Microsoft Graph, it’s worth mentioning, Microsoft is now building a fabric that will tie all of your devices and applications together. Whether that will work as planned remains to be seen, but it’s a bold project that could have wide-reaching consequences for how you use Microsoft’s tools, even on Android, in the future. VR/AR/Real World Another topic both companies talked about at their events are virtual and augmented reality. Here, both Google and Microsoft are talking about the spectrum of experiences that sit between full augmented reality (or “mixed reality” as Microsoft calls it) and virtual reality (and at the other end of that is “real reality” in Google’s charts). With HoloLens, Microsoft has a clear lead in standalone augmented reality experiences. That’s a $3,000 device, though. Google’s current approach is different in that it want to use machine vision (combined with its Tango technology) to use phones as the prime lens for viewing AR experiences. As for VR, Google this year talked a lot about standalone headsets. Yet while it revealed a few partners, it remained vague about specs, prices and release dates. Microsoft, on the other hand, is currently focusing on tethered headsets from partners like Acer that combine some of its HoloLens technology for tracking your movements with the power of the connected Windows 10 PC. Microsoft is shipping dev kits now and consumers will be able to buy them later this year. It’s HoloLens, though, is technically miles ahead of anything Google even showed blueprints of at I/O. That’s a surprise, because Google had a lead in building a VR ecosystem thanks to its quirky Cardboard viewers, but now it feels like it’s at the risk of falling behind. Developer Conferences Both Microsoft and Google used their events to announce relatively evolutionary updates to their flagship operating systems. Google, of course, had already pre-announced Android O and Microsoft had already pre-announced that it’ll now offer two Windows 10 releases a year, so the fact that we’ll get a new update in the fall really wasn’t a surprise. For both companies, these developer shows are high-stakes events. Google I/O, however, felt pretty relaxed this year. Indeed, it almost felt as if I/O came at the wrong time of the year for the company. There simply wasn’t all that much to announce this year, it felt, and while that would’ve allowed Google to more clearly lay out its vision, it instead squandered valuable keynote time on talking about previously announced YouTube features that few people in the audience cared about. While Microsoft admittedly has a far wider product portfolio for developers, its event had far more energy and showed a clearer vision. Microsoft, too, made sure that its event focused almost exclusively on developers (“There will be coding on stage,” a Microsoft representative warned the assembled media before the first keynote). Google’s event (and especially the main keynote) often felt like the company didn’t quite know who its audience was (developers? consumers? the press?). And Google had a “developer keynote” at its developer conference. That must have been a first. When Microsoft showed off Remix at Build, it was to tell developers that they, too, can take the company’s tools and build an experience like this. When Google showed off Google Photos, it showed consumers that they can now use its technology to quickly make photo books. Yet really interesting new feature for developers, like Instant Apps, were barely mentioned in the keynote, even though they touch both consumers and developers. Yet the fact that the addition of Kotlin as a first-class language for Android development got more applause than any other announcement at the show clearly shows what the core audience is (in the press boxes, that announcement mostly resulted in blank stares, of course). So to be blunt, I/O was relativelyboring this year. There was no new hardware, no major new developer tools, no big new consumer product, very few new tools and almost no products that developers or consumers can use right now (and not even a full name for Android O). Maybe this kind of annual cadence for developer conferences simply doesn’t work anymore now that technology moves way too fast for annual updates, but it also remains the most effective tool to bring a developer ecosystem together under one roof (or tents, in Google’s case), state your case and lay out your vision. This year, Microsoft did a better job at that.   0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Symphony Messaging App Joins the Unicorn Club | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Google Microsoft msbuild2017 googleio17 Artificial Intelligence Popular Posts Featured Stories Google in, Google out 17 hours ago | Jon Evans, Columnist Bitcoin just surged past $2,000 for the first time yesterday | Jon Russell, Fitz Tepper SoftBank’s massive Vision Fund raises $93 billion in its first close yesterday | Jon Russell The bizarre naming trends that modern startups follow yesterday | Joanna Glasner Latest From TechCrunch LeEco founder Jia Yueting resigns as CEO of its publicly listed unit Leshi 1 hour ago | Catherine Shu Gillmor Gang: Binge & Purge 5 hours ago | Steve Gillmor How culinary school and gaming helped former teacher Mannah Kallon land a career in coding 5 hours ago | Ruben Harris After a year of catching up, Google Home needs to truly distinguish itself from the Echo 6 hours ago | Brian Heater Comment moderation powered by Up Next Gillmor Gang: Binge & Purge Posted 5 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Web Developer at Essense Partners (New York, NY, United States) Embedded Software Engineer @ Brava Home at Brava Home (Redwood City, CA, United States) DevOps Engineer @ Brava Home at Brava Home (Redwood City, CA, United States) Senior Engineer Frontend at Plexchat (Redwood City, CA, United States) Automation Engineer @ Brava Home at Brava Home (Redwood City, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip Activations Blog International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Android Go is just a config, not new version, of Android JC Torres - May 21, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It’s not that hard to compare the recently announced Android Go with the more or less dead Android One initiative and conclude that the former replaces the latter. After all, both target entry-level devices which are most likely going to litter emerging markets. Considering the Android Go presentation was direct to the point but short on the details, that conclusion is easier reached. But in a post-I/O interview with NDTV, Google VP of Product Management for Android and Google Play Sameer Samat makes it pretty clear. No, Android Go isn’t replacing Android One, and, no, it isn’t a distinct version of Android either. Android Go is just Android, or, to be more exact, Android O. It isn’t a distinct version of Android like, say Android Wear or Android TV, and not even a “custom ROM” of Android, like, a TouchWiz or an EMUI. It is, instead, a configuration that OEMs can use when building smartphones with 1 GB of RAM or less. It’s a configuration that just happens to disable some resource-wasting features, pre-installs more resource-friendly versions of certain Google apps, and highlights third-party apps with a similar bent. This is distinctly different from Android One and there might even be a time when the two paths cross in the near future. Android One reflected more the Nexus program, with Google recommending a certain set of hardware, putting a vanilla Android experience on top, and promising a certain period of updates. Initially, those hardware requirements were locked down to low to mid tier components but Google eventually relented and removed those limits. Still, it probably won’t be impossible to see an Android One device with low enough specs to warrant running Android Go. Since Android Go isn’t a different version of Android, there is no fragmentation to worry about. At least that’s the theory. Android Go is Android O, so developers need not really write a different version of an app. In fact, Samat even implies it could help fix the problem of fragmentation, since developers will be able to target low-end devices without having to worry that those devices are forced to run older versions of Android. And since it’s Android O anyway, any device running Android Go will be able to install any regular Android app, even the full versions of apps like YouTube, but at their own expense. Google is confident that by the time Android Go phones launch next year, there will still be a sizeable market of very low-end phones, despite the bottom line these days rising to 2 GB of RAM. It won’t be making Android Go available for existing or higher end devices, however. But, since this is Android and open source, it will only be a matter of time before some other developers make that a thing.

What we type in the search box may not be traced back to us as individuals, but our online queries – from relationships and sex to how we really feel about our kids – remain in web space to be examined, researched and turned into statistics that reveal how we really tick. AP:Associated Press 17 What do your Google searches reveal about you? A new book by former Google data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz explores what our search habits say about our private lives and our real views – rather than our publicly-voiced opinions. And he says that what we confess at our keyboards contradicts much of the conventional wisdom from surveys, studies and polls. Seth has spent the past four years poring over Google searches, Wikipedia and Facebook profiles and data from adult website Pornhub. Getty Images 17 Many Google searches involve our relationships He said: “Google was invented so people could learn about the world, not so researchers could learn about people. “But the trails we leave as we seek knowledge are tremendously revealing.” Here, Senior Feature Writer CAROLINE IGGULDEN examines some of Seth’s fascinating findings.

Indeed, Seth writes: “Men google more questions about their sexual organ than any other body part – more than about their lungs, liver, feet, ears, nose, throat and brain combined. “Men do more searches for how to make their penises bigger than how to tune a guitar, make an omelette or change a tyre.” Men’s top-googled question about ageing is whether it will make their penis shrink. But women care far less about the size of their partner’s organ. For every one search that women make about a partner’s size, men make roughly 170 searches of their own. Getty Images 17 More than 40 per cent of complaints by women about size are that their lover is too well endowed And more than 40 per cent of complaints by women about size are that their lover is too well endowed – whereas only one per cent of searches by men about changing penis size are looking to make it smaller. Men’s second commonest sex question is how to make their sexual encounters last longer. In contrast, roughly the same number of women search how to make their partner climax more quickly. Among searches beginning “How to . . . ” that are related to breasts, about 20 per cent ask how to get rid of man boobs. And it seems there has been a “Kardashian effect” on how women view their behinds. In 2004 the top search about changing female bums was how to shrink them. But the interest in boosting bum size then tripled in just four years.   Marriage and relationships Getty Images 17 Married men and women each report having sex about once a week According to official surveys, married men and women each report having sex about once a week. Yet Google search data paints a far bleaker picture. Searches for “sexless marriage” are three-and-a-half times more common than “unhappy marriage”. And there are 16 times more complaints about a spouse not wanting sex than about a married partner not being willing to talk, with men the main culprits. There are twice as many complaints that a boyfriend won’t have sex than a girlfriend. Indeed, the top complaint in search data about a “boyfriend” is that he won’t have sex. Alamy 17 There are 16 times more complaints about a spouse not wanting sex than about a married partner not being willing to talk And the question “Is my husband . . . ” is ten per cent more likely to be followed by the word “gay” than the word “cheating” and eight times more likely than “an alcoholic”. However, women are twice as likely than men to seek online advice on how to perform better oral sex on their partner. Sadly, blokes make as many searches on how to perform oral sex on themselves as they do on how to give a woman an orgasm.   Children Getty Images 17 Adults with children are 3.6 times more likely to tell Google they regret their decision than childless adult People are seven times more likely to ask Google if they will regret not having children than if they will regret having them. But after going ahead and starting a family, those numbers are reversed. Adults with children are 3.6 times more likely to tell Google they regret their decision than childless adults. The most common way to complete a Google search beginning “Is my two-year-old . . . ” is with the words “gifted” or “a genius”. But parents are two and a half times more likely to ask if their son is gifted than their daughter. Getty Images 17 Parents are two and a half times more likely to ask if their son is gifted than their daughter This is despite clear evidence that at this age, girls are more likely to be educationally advanced. Meanwhile, parents are twice as likely to google “Is my daughter overweight?” than the same question about a son. Yet health data shows that about 28 per cent of girls are overweight, as opposed to   35 per cent of boys. Parents are also one and a half times more likely to ask if their daughter is beautiful than if their son is handsome. And they are three times more likely to ask if a daughter is ugly than a son.   Race Shutterstock 17 Americans search for the term ‘kill Muslims’ as often as ‘martini recipes’ and ‘migraine symptoms’ Seth found that sex and romance are not the only subjects about which people reveal their true feelings anonymously online. Americans, for instance, search for the term “kill Muslims” as often as “martini recipes” and “migraine symptoms.” Four days after 2015’s mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by Muslim husband and wife Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, President Obama gave a national address speaking of the importance of inclusion and tolerance. AP:Associated Press 17 After the mass-shooting by Muslim husband and wife Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, searches calling Muslims ‘bad’, violent’, ‘evil’ and ‘terrorists’ doubled The speech was widely praised by pundits at the time, yet Seth found Google data indicated it didn’t have the calming effect intended. During and after the speech searches calling Muslims “bad”, “violent”, “evil” and “terrorists” doubled. Pornography Getty Images 17 Only about 25 per cent of men and eight per cent of women admit to watching pornography Americans search for “porn” more often than they search for “weather”. This is despite findings in surveys that only about 25 per cent of men and eight per cent of women admit to watching pornography. But Seth argues that while there is a common perception that the internet is dominated by smut, it is not actually true. He writes: “Of the top ten most visited websites, not one is pornographic. So the popularity of porn, while enormous, should not be overstated.” But he also describes the existence of porn and the data it yields as a “revolutionary development in the science of human sexuality”. Getty Images 17 Of the top 100 searches by men on Pornhub, 16 are looking for incest-themed videos Seth’s examination of popular searches on the website Pornhub revealed some shocking trends. In India, the top search beginning “My husband wants . . . ” is completed by “ . . . me to breastfeed him” and porn searches for women breastfeeding men are four times higher than in any other country.   Of the top 100 searches by men on Pornhub, 16 are looking for incest-themed videos, with most searching for scenes of mothers and sons. The number is fewer for women but still an unnerving nine out of every 100 searches are for incest videos, with most looking for scenes featuring fathers and daughters. The top choice to complete the global Google search “I want to have sex with my . . . ” is “mum”. However, Seth does concede in his book that Google can display a bias towards controversial thoughts which people feel they cannot share with anyone else. One of the more common searches  made before or after “gay porn” is “gay test”, suggesting many users are keen to know if watching such videos means they are homosexual.   Pregnancy Shutterstock 17 Pregnant women worldwide seem to crave the same types of food Seth looked into how pregnancy played out in web searches around the world. He found that despite living in different countries and cultures, pregnant women worldwide seem to crave the same types of food, the top five being spicy, salt, sweets, chocolate and ice cream. But the concerns of pregnant women seem to differ from country to country. In Britain, the top five search terms after the question “Can pregnant women . . . ” are “eat prawns”, “eat smoked salmon”, “eat cheesecake”, “eat mozzarella” and “eat mayonnaise”. Getty Images 17 Questions on how to stop stretch marks dominate searches in the US, Australia and Britain American women ask about drinking coffee and wine, eating sushi and taking paracetamol. Nigerian women want to know if they can drink cold water, have sex and continue to eat a particular type of edible plant, and Brazilians want to know if they can dye their hair, ride a bike and fly. Questions on how to stop stretch marks dominate searches in the US, Australia and Britain. But among Nigerian and Indian women the issue does not make the top five “how to” questions. There, they are keener to know how to have sex in pregnancy, how to sleep and how to feel better.   Anxiety Getty Images 17 People less worried about global issues than their own problems Seth told The Sun how recently he has been working on what our internet searches can tell us about anxiety levels. He said: “After the election of Trump there was a lot of stuff on social media about how anxious people were feeling. “But I looked at Google search data in liberal areas where people would likely be upset about Trump and found that there was no increase in searches around anxiety, panic attacks or anything like that. Getty Images 17 Issues like money or legal problems dominate searches about worries “Similarly you would expect a terrorist attack which kills dozens or even hundreds would trigger massive, widespread panic. But there was no rise at all in anxiety-related searches in the days, weeks and months following every major attack in Europe or America since 2004. “It struck me that while people seem to feel it is more socially acceptable to claim to be anxious about big, global political issues, it is actually more self-centred issues like money or legal problems that keep them awake at night.”   Social media Getty Images 17 Google searches reveal a different side to us than the one we present on social media Seth’s research convinced him that while our social media profiles might paint one picture of our thoughts and interests, our Google searches show another. For instance, women’s top five terms for describing husbands on social media are “the best”, “my best friend”, “amazing”, “the greatest” and “so cute”. Yet in Google searches, the list is “gay”, “amazing”, “annoying” and “mean”. Seth highlights a Microsoft study of 58,000 Facebook users which found that those who like Mozart, thunderstorms and curly fries have higher IQs than those who like motorbikes or the page “I Love Being a Mum”.

After a year of catching up, Google Home needs to truly distinguish itself from the Echo Posted 6 hours ago by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Examining the NYC footprints of global tech titans Google Home has spent the past year catching up. No surprise, really. The Echo had a roughly two-year head start on the device. This week, the smart home hub celebrated the one-year anniversary at I/O of its announcements with a few key additions aimed at making its product a true competitor. From the looks of it, the company is playing the long game here, seeding mobile devices with Assistant and rolling out subtle upgrades that make its device less of a blunt instrument than Amazon’s offering. Certainly the company has the data infrastructure and mobile market share to find that success. But subtly and robustness are hard plays when it comes to the consumer market — particularly one utterly dominated by a competitor. If Google wants to set itself apart, it’s going to have make a show of it. Two years is a pretty large gap to overcome in the tech world, particularly when one company has managed to become synonymous with the category in the meantime. Google no doubt understood the shadow it would be attempting to crawl out of when it launched its device at last year’s event – including, but not limited at least a couple of years of being referred to by the press and consumers as “Google Echo.” The company has clearly spent much of the past year working to correct this. When the product was announced, the differences between the devices were pretty pronounced. From a lack of features to third-party partners, the gap was notable. And besides, the Echo was already a surprise success for the Amazon. Many of those who were interested in the category had already picked one up – and it’s hard to imagine that smart home hubs will have a swifter upgrade cycle than, say, tablet. Google’s made a slight dent in the overall numbers, but as it stands, Amazon’s expected to control around 70-percent of the voice-controlled speaker market this year, according to numbers released earlier this month. Google’s numbers are hovering at around a third of that amount. With Amazon adding a slew of options into the mix including, perhaps most notably, the low-cost Echo Dot, it’s easy to see that domination continuing. At I/O, Google execs noted that the company doesn’t plan to continue playing second fiddle to Amazon – and really, what else did you expect it to say? The company demonstrated its plans with a handful of new features that were a combination of playing catch up and pulling out ahead. The company added on-device calling, for instance, a feature Amazon introduced a while back. Home’s ability to identify voices means it can figure out non-proper names like “mom.” The device is also broadening the functionality to all of a user’s contacts, versus recently released Amazon’s solution, whose calls are limited to other Echoes and devices running the Alexa app. Features like this and the new “proactive notifications” are starting to paint a picture of Home as a more capable device in its relatively limited feature set. It’s clear that the company is working to build a more robust product than Amazon’s offering, which appeared to begin life as a backdoor channel for its AI assistant, with the company lacking the mobile channels of a Google or Apple. At this rate, Google should make some serious inroads in market share a couple of years from now, assuming Apple doesn’t blow everyone’s minds with the also late to party smart hub some rumors have pointed to for a WWDC debut next month. And certainly there are plenty of products in the company’s portfolio that can be categorized as a slow burner. But if the product is going to be truly competitive, now’s the time to become more than the Google Echo and offer something truly new. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Alexa Founded 1996 Overview Founded in April 1996, Alexa Internet grew out of a vision of Web navigation that is intelligent and constantly improving with the participation of its users.

Google, along with Facebook and Apple, is making huge investments into artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Google Lens is its first implementation of these technologies. Google CEO Sundar Pichai provided some details about Google Lens and claimed it is a major inflection point for the company. "All of Google was built because we started understanding text and web pages," Pichai explained. "So, the fact that computers can understand images and videos has profound implications for our core mission." Google Lens will bring a level of intelligence to the phone that combines images with artificial intelligence and augmented reality, combining the real with the virtual. Some of the examples he cited let you point your phone’s camera at a flower and its name, along with information about the flower, will be shown on the screen. Point it at a restaurant or another store and reviews and information will be shown above the store’s image. You’ll also be able to use Google Lens as a means of search. Point the camera at an object and it will tell you where you can buy it or other information about what it recognizes. Google Lens will also be added to Google Photos and allow you to search them by what’s in the images, or modify the photos themselves. Pichai demonstrated how your images can be cleaned up using artificial intelligence. He used the example of taking a picture through a chain link fence and removing the fence from the picture automatically. These areas of technology are the focus of Apple and Facebook as well, and many expect us to be fully engaged with apps using them before the end of the year. Facebook is pouring billions of dollars into developing virtual and augmented reality software. They envision that we’ll be able to just wear a special pair of glasses, and the information will be presented to us without the need for a phone. Apple CEO Tim Cook has praised the benefits of augmented reality and has hinted that the new iPhones being introduced this fall will make heavy use of it. We can see some examples today of the potential. Vivino, a free app used by 23 million people, lets you take a picture of a wine list and see the ratings for each wine. It’s a multi-step process now: take the picture, enter it, wait for the processing to occur, and then view an image of the wine list with the ratings. With augmented reality, it will be simpler: just point the camera at the list and see the information displayed alongside it. Once the basics are enabled in phones and other devices, a huge community of developers will create exciting new applications. https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/05/20/google-introduces-game-changing-google-lens-at-developer-conference/ load more facebook Share Google Introduces Game-Changing Google Lens at Developer Conference twitter Tweet email Email Related Products The Western Story Lecture #6: The Genres of Western Learning: Novels, Plays, Poems, Essays and Treatises amazon.com History In The News Lecture #2: The 21st American Century or What Amazon or Facebook Says About America amazon.com Klavan and Whittle: Manly Men and Womanly Women amazon.com Editor's Choice The Horrific Experience of Growing Butterflies comments Bill Cosby Blames Racism for Sex Assault Allegations... comments Study: Parents Are Happier Than Non-Parents comments Who knew your inbox could be this informative?

[Photo: Hero Images/Getty Images] By caroline sinders4 minute Read Machine learning is going to radically change product design. But what is the future of machine learning? Is it the singularity, flying cars, voiceless commands, or an Alexa that can actually understand you? Before we can even get to that part–the grand futurism part–I want to offer a provocation: Machine learning won’t reach its potential–and may actually cause harm–if it doesn’t develop in tandem with user experience design. advertisement Machine learning refers to different kinds of algorithms that learn from inputs like human interaction or data and create evolving feedback over time from that input. It can use preexisting data to create predictions or create new kinds of connections or pattern within data sets. If this sounds complicated, well . . . it is! Machine learning creates opaque and hard to understand systems using data and technology. It can be hard to predict results from machine learning, especially if there isn’t a lot known about the data set or the algorithm being used. This is where design is key. UX and product design take the capabilities, ideas, and policies of an idea or a solution and turn it into a usable experience that lets consumers understand what that product is doing and how it does it.  [Photo: Markus Spiske/Unsplash]The ethical and practical considerations of machine learning have to be shaped by how products using machine learning affect users and how users can understand and see those effects. Illustrating all the different components are key–what kinds of questions are being asked, what the intended solution is, what the specific algorithm was designed or intended to do, what is the data set in question, and what’s in that data set. There are a lot of moving parts. If the conversation on how algorithms are made and what they do doesn’t include designers, systems will continue to be made that are hard to understand, obfuscate the intent, and ultimately harm. Google “professional hair” and see the results. It’s a lot of very typical white hairstyles. Google “unprofessional hair” and you’ll see mainly black hair styles. Professor LaTanya Sweeney of Harvard’s Data Privacy Lab did a study showing that if you search black-sounding names, Google pulls up sponsored ads related to arrest in the search results. Sweeney Googled her own and it brought up questions of “LaTanya Sweeney arrested?” Professor Sweeney has no criminal record. ProPublica has reported on predictive justice and policing integrated into courtrooms. Algorithms, and machine learning, can have erroneous and incredibly biased results that can hurt people. [Photo: Émile Perron/Unsplash]But there is hope. In March, the AAAI conference–an academic conference on engineering and technology hosted at Stanford–had a track dedicated to machine learning and UX. The track was led by Mike Kuniavsky of Parc; Elizabeth Churchill, director of UX at Google; and Molly Wright Steenson, professor in the School of Design at Carnegie Mellon University. This was one of the first conferences I had attended that really blended academic and industry concerns, engineering, and user experience design. “You need a general literacy, and a design framing or orientation that becomes part of the way someone breathes. So in that moment under pressure, when they are making a design decision, whether it’s an interaction decision or engineering decision, it’s as natural as breathing for them to think about the consequences of human interaction or the ethical interaction,” Churchill said. Any good designer will tell you why design thinking is needed when creating a product, an app, or an idea for human consumption. Usability is key, but “usability” has to mean guarding against erroneous results that can dramatically affect the intended use of your project. The future of machine learning is coming up with a hybrid language that bridges design and engineering, with a focus on ethical and causal effects for consumers. Johanne Christensen, PhD candidate at NC State University in computer science, focusing on UX and machine learning, articulates the problems with algorithms for users thusly: “When users don’t understand how an algorithm gets its results, it can be difficult to trust the system, particularly if the consequences of incorrect results are detrimental to the person using it. Transparency communicates trust.” But how that transparency is articulated to users is a design challenge, and it requires designers to understand data. Here’s an idea that’s purely an illustrative example: If you are creating an app to help recommend fitness suggestions based on health data, you need to know what kind of health data you are using. You want to know where the data comes from, how old it is, and how many different kinds of body types, ages, people, and locations are in your data set. advertisement These aren’t details designers typically concern themselves with, but they need to. The product you are building uses a specific kind of algorithm and how that algorithm responds to a specific data set is a design effect–whether or not you intend it, and whether or not you know what the outcome will be.

The AI-powered Google Assistant is Google's answer to the likes of Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, always at your beck and call to answer those tricky questions and help manage your life. Google Assistant is at the heart of the Google Home smart benchtop speaker, which is coming to Australia this year, but the search giant is determined to see its talkative assistant on as many devices as possible. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Google Assistant is making Android TV smarter than ever. Photo: Adam Turner On the box Google's smart TV platform is an obvious candidate for Google Assistant integration, considering your television is the home entertainment hub and often left switched on. The integration of Google Assistant is part of Android TV's Android O upgrade which enhances Google's efforts to seamlessly weave free-to-air, recorded, subscription and streaming television into the one interface. The source of the content is irrelevant, the idea is to simply help you find something of interest and start watching as effortlessly as possible. You can pin your favourite apps and sources to the top "My Apps" row of the home screen, underneath which is a Netflix-style "Watch Next" list and "Recommended" where all apps have the ability to place recommendations based on your tastes and recent viewing habits include programs you're in the middle of watching. Advertisement Content thumbnails are actually live video previews – not just playing the clip from the beginning but instead finding the actual trailer for that piece of content. When you click play you go directly to the content and start watching, rather than simply being dumped into that app. Talk the talk Sony offers one of the slickest Android TV implementations, which already has some great search features, but Google Assistant takes it to the next level. It won't be available on televisions for several months, so its developers offered a demo running on an Nvidia Shield at the recent Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View, California. For starters Google Assistant allows Android TV to handle far more complex searches, with the contextual awareness to follow your chain of thought. For example "Find Winona Ryder on Jimmy Kimmel" calls up a list of YouTube clips of his show and you can simply say "play the first one" to listen to them discuss Stranger Things, rather than spelling out exactly what you want the television to do. From here you can call up Google Assistant over the bottom of the screen, with a casual "Okay Google" and then ask "tell me about Stranger Things" followed by "how many episodes does it have?". At this point Google Assistant will start reading the answers aloud whilst displaying the details, all without disrupting the playback of the Jimmy Kimmel YouTube clip. If you've decided that you're keen on the show then simply say "Okay Google, Play Stranger Things" and it will smoothly transition across to Netflix and start playing the first episode. It's an incredibly slick user experience when you consider how clunky it would be to go through all those steps in your average lounge room. Sit back Of course another advantage of having Google Assistant in your television is that you can talk to it like Google Home, asking it to dim the lights, pause the music in the next room and order you a pizza delivery while you sit back to watch the first episode. If you remember that you're supposed to be somewhere else, Google Assistant on the television can check traffic conditions and travel times to see if you can afford to spend a few more minutes on the couch. One disappointment is that Google Assistant on Android TV can't yet recognise different voices but it's coming and this will certainly take the personalised Android lounge room experience to the next level. How smart is your lounge room and how would you put Google Assistant to good use on your television? Adam Turner travelled to the Google I/O conference in California as a guest of Google.

News sign-up Publishers keep faith in affiliate marketing News, 22 May 2017 Topics Websites, online services, apps Online display effectiveness SAN FRANCISCO: Despite lingering concerns among publishers that their affiliate marketing revenue expectations have not been met, nearly nine-in-ten (86%) expect to maintain or increase their spend in the future, a new survey has found. Based on responses from some 500 publishers as well as 100 merchants that currently use affiliate marketing, content platform VigLink also revealed that 91% of merchants plan to increase or keep their affiliate marketing budgets the same. VigLink, which is backed by Google Ventures among others, sought to check the pulse of this relatively new market at a time when ad blocking is on the rise and traditional banner ads are on the decline. Its survey revealed that the top two revenue generators for most publishers in 2015-16 were Google AdSense and affiliate marketing, placing these native formats ahead of display – although this applied more for smaller publishers with fewer unique monthly views. Large publishers with over 100,000+ unique monthly views still made the majority of their revenue from display advertising, followed by Google AdSense and then affiliated marketing, the survey found. But a third (34%) of publishers with fewer than 5,000 unique monthly views ranked affiliate marketing as their number one way of generating revenue. And despite 64% of publishers reporting that their affiliate marketing revenue expectations were not met, VigLink found that 77% of them said the revenue generated from the format increased or remained consistent from 2015 to 2016. By contrast, nearly three-quarters (73%) of merchants – or around twice the number of publishers – reported that revenue generated from using affiliate marketing programs met their expectations. "One reason publishers' expectations of affiliate revenue is not being met could be due, in part, to declining page views. Time spent online has shifted from publishers' sites to social media," the report noted. "Google AMP, Facebook Instant Articles, and Snapchat Discover are all channels that were once sources of traffic back to publishers' sites and are now one-stop reading portals for consumers." However, the report continued: "The declining page views is a key reason revenue expectations aren't being met [in] affiliate marketing, but publishers still plan to use it in the future."

The court ruled that the FAA’s drone registration rules, which have been in place since 2015, were in violation of a law passed by Congress in 2012. Recode Kill Google AMP before it KILLS the web There's been a good deal of ongoing discussion about Google AMP – Accelerated Mobile Pages. Quite a few high-profile web developers have this year weighted in with criticism and some, following a Google conference dedicated to AMP, have cautioned users about diving in with both feet. These, in my view, don’t go far enough in stating the problem and I feel this needs to be said very clearly: Google's AMP is bad – bad in a potentially web-destroying way. The Register Almost all WannaCry victims were running Windows 7 One week after it first hit, researchers are getting a better handle on how the WannaCry ransomware spread so quickly — and judging from the early figures, the story seems to be almost entirely about Windows 7. According to data released today by Kaspersky Lab, roughly 98 percent of the computers affected by the ransomware were running some version of Windows 7, with less than one in a thousand running Windows XP. 2008 R2 Server clients were also hit hard, making up just over 1 percent of infections. The Verge (also, French researchers find way to unlock WannaCry without ransom and WannaCrypt makes an easy case for Linux) Panasonic recalls 280,000 tablet battery packs due to fire hazard Panasonic this week announced a voluntary recall of batteries due to fire and burn hazards. The battery packs being recalled were used in one of its rugged tablets. In total, the company is recalling 280 thousand battery packs, after over a dozen of them encountered critical failures. Panasonic has discovered that some of the hot-swappable battery packs used in some of its rugged Toughpad FZ-G1 tablets (Mk1, Mk2 and Mk3-series) can short circuit after a prolonged use in extreme temperatures. AnandTech Net neutrality going down in flames as FCC votes to kill Title II rules The US Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 today to start the process of eliminating net neutrality rules and the classification of home and mobile Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes eliminating the Title II classification and seeks comment on what, if anything, should replace the current net neutrality rules. But Chairman Ajit Pai is making no promises about reinstating the two-year-old net neutrality rules that forbid ISPs from blocking or throttling lawful Internet content or prioritizing content in exchange for payment. Ars Technica (also, One step closer to a closed internet) The state of the car computer: Forget horsepower, we want megahertz! If I asked you "how many computing devices do you own?" your mind will probably first jump to your PCs and laptops at home, and then to your smartphones and tablets. The more tech savvy might include smartwatches, TVs, and video game systems. But there's one computing device that not many people think about as a computing device: the car infotainment system. Ars Technica It's time for PC game demos to make a comeback I've been privately lamenting the lack of PC game demos lately. There was a time when demos were commonplace: a chunk of a brand new game you could try out for free before you bought the full game. Demos gave us a chance not only see what a game had to offer and whether or not we enjoyed it, but also allowed us to continually tweak the settings and try different graphics options to see how our PCs handled it. PC Gamer All fossil-fuel vehicles will vanish in 8 years in twin ‘death spiral’ for big oil and big autos, says study that’s shocking the industries No more petrol or diesel cars, buses, or trucks will be sold anywhere in the world within eight years. The entire market for land transport will switch to electrification, leading to a collapse of oil prices and the demise of the petroleum industry as we have known it for a century. Financial Post “MP3 is dead” missed the real, much better story If you read the news, you may think the MP3 file format was recently officially “killed” somehow, and any remaining MP3 holdouts should all move to AAC now. These are all simple rewrites of Fraunhofer IIS’ announcement that they’re terminating the MP3 patent-licensing program. Very few people got it right. The others missed what happened last month: Marco Arment Families will spend more than a third of summer staring at screens like zombies Summertime is almost here, meaning families will begin spending more time outdoors enjoying nature, right? Not necessarily. In modern times, devices seem to rule our attention. Things like computer monitors, televisions, smartphones, and tablets keep our eyes focused on screens like zombies. BetaNews Monoprice releases their Mini Delta printer (on Indiegogo) Around this time last year, Monoprice quietly unveiled a small, $200 3D printer. At the time, a fully functioning printer at this price point wasn’t unheard of. A good 3D printer at this price point was. It turned out this printer was actually fantastic and completely changed the value proposition of desktop 3D printers. Hackaday Researchers grow brain cells on a chip Every human thought starts with a signal traveling from one neuron to another in the brain. Yet we know relatively little about how these connections form. In an effort to watch that process unfold, Australian researchers engineered a nanowire scaffold on a semiconductor chip that enables brain cells to grow and form circuits. The scientists described their device recently in the journal Nano Letters. IEEE Spectrum Self-driving cars have a bicycle problem Robotic cars are great at monitoring other cars, and they’re getting better at noticing pedestrians, squirrels, and birds. The main challenge, though, is posed by the lightest, quietest, swerviest vehicles on the road. “Bicycles are probably the most difficult detection problem that autonomous vehicle systems face,” says UC Berkeley research engineer Steven Shladover.

From what have been gathered so far, the upcoming Android competitor may best the others in performance. Here’s what can be expected when the Pixel successor comes out. Android O Android’s next major update that has yet to be named is on course for its release later this year. The second developer preview has just been released with the next update following possibly next month. It is due for an official launch sometime in Q3 2017 according to speculations, so it should be already available when Google Pixel 2 is revealed. While Android Nougat has yet to reach other devices, fans are already excited for the next update, which includes an overhaul of the emojis. The latest developer preview changed the unusual design into something that resembles the iOS’ version of the smileys. On top of that, Android O Developer Preview 2 also included a bunch of new features that are sure to delight users, the Inquisitr reports. Seeing that there are more previews to come, more features are expected to be revealed that will arrive with the final product. Google is finally replacing its bad emoji blobs in Android O https://t.co/hQiiU7YLR6 pic.twitter.com/Kutl9v18Xv — The Verge (@verge) May 17, 2017 Early Release There is a notion that Google Pixel 2 might be revealed alongside Android O, which may be distributed in August or September according to previous Android versions’ patterns. If so, then the smartphone’s release will come sooner than the Pixel’s anniversary in October. A Google Pixel 2 prototype is already running on Android O, hinting that its release will not be long now. ValueWalk even believes that it is coming as early as July, but no evidence points to that being the case. Nonetheless, no one can be sure exactly when the search engine company is unveiling the next set of Pixel phones, but it is highly likely that it is planning an early release. Three Variants [Image by Eric Risberg/AP Images] Last year, Google introduced two variants of the Pixel, which were codenamed Sailfish and Marlin while in development. This year, three codenames have popped up, Muskie, Walleye, and Taimen. According to Forbes, this may be the tech giant’s response to Apple’s and Samsung’s lineups this year, both of which consist of three devices with varying sizes and features. Out of the three Pixel 2 codenames, only two have been spotted so far. The Walleye was the prototype running on Android O mentioned above while the Taimen was spotted on the benchmarking website Geekbench, as previously reported by the Inquisitr. Muskie is yet to show up, but it is only a matter of time. Right now, there is no clear difference between the three variants aside from screen size. The fish walleye is the smallest of the three, which means that the model with this codename will be the smallest. The muskies are larger, but taimens are much bigger. Being the last to be discovered, the Taimen model is believed to be the premium Pixel 2 that may be competing with the iPhone 8 and Note 8. Top-Notch Specs Being a competitive flagship, the Google Pixel 2 should only have high-end specs. Its predecessor had a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip when other flagships featured a Snapdragon 820, so the next one should also be ahead of the others. But it is unknown if there will be a refreshed Snapdragon 835 SoC, making it the bare minimum processor for Google’s 2017 flagship. Google Pixel 2 (Taimen) Spotted On Geekbench https://t.co/hl9Mclus5T #android #android_o #Devices pic.twitter.com/H4xmV4VmQJ — AndroGuider (@androguider) May 11, 2017 The processor will be paired with 4GB RAM as revealed by the benchmark listing of Taimen. It is expected all three variants will have the same specs, so Walleye and Muskie must also have the same configuration. All three will likely be offered with non-expandable 64GB, 128GB and 256GB internal storage options.

The first developer’s preview still featured these emojis that are shaped like the end of a thumb, but the second preview now showcased them in a more traditional look with the shape of a circle. We are all familiar with Android’s idea of emojis that leave much to be desired. With an unconventional shape, the set attempted to be different than the ones we grew up with. But we were not exactly sure that we wanted it to be different. Still, the emojis stayed with Android through the years and even with other Google apps like Hangouts. Now that they are being redesigned, users cannot be happier, proving that they were only putting up with it because it’s negligible compared to the other offerings of the operating system. The emojis, seen below, are still more colorful and animated than their iOS counterparts. We can’t say which operating system has a better set of emojis, but now Android can finally be competitive in terms of emoticons – if ever that was a factor in choosing which smartphone to buy. Google is finally replacing its bad emoji blobs in Android O https://t.co/hQiiU7YLR6 pic.twitter.com/Kutl9v18Xv — The Verge (@verge) May 17, 2017 You can see all the new emojis over at Ars Technica. Android O Developers Preview 2 Focuses On A Fluid Experience The change is certainly a big one, but not the biggest one to come in Android O. The latest developer preview brought about huge adjustments to the system and the user interface, making the experience more “fluid,” according to the official Developers Blog. One of the highlights of the Android O Developers Preview 2 is the picture-in-picture feature that allows users to look at two screens simultaneously. Basically, you can put an app within an app, which works differently than split-screens. This can be used to watch a video while browsing in other apps or to video call while replying to someone’s text message. Other Android O features outlined by Dave Burke, VP of Engineering, are new notification dots with more functions, Autofill with Google, a new Android TV home screen, and TensorFlow Lite. The Smart Text Selection is also pretty cool as it enhances the copy/paste function by recognizing what the selection is. It could be an email address or a phone number; the OS will recognize this and carry out an action based on this. Android O has also been improved more than the naked eye can see. More system optimizations have been done, and limits have been placed on background apps. All these work to provide customers with a more “fluid” user experience. Android O Release Date Still Unknown, Some Features Coming To Chromebook First It is unknown when Android O is coming to mobile devices, but fans can expect some of its features to go live on Chromebooks first. It seems that Google will not be waiting for the OS to be fully launched before releasing the Chrome OS with the Android O features that are beneficial to it. Data exchange between Chrome OS and Android apps https://t.co/Fx0nZgGbJa pic.twitter.com/666emla4MX — Paolo Amoroso (@amoroso) May 10, 2017 According to Kan Liu, Chrome OS’ Senior Director of Product Management, only the features that make sense for the operating system will go live. This means that you won’t see all of Android O features until it is officially released, Android Headlines reports. As of now, fans expect Android O to start arriving in supported devices in August, which is also when Nougat was released last year. It will most likely come first to Google’s own devices, such as the Pixel 2 if it is already available by then. Hopefully, all Android smartphones will be updated with Nougat before then.

Name: Subject: Message: This Was Google I/O 2017 Features Newsby Kris Carlon9 hours ago 55 95 7 After three intense days of activity, Google I/O has wrapped for the year. Unlike last year, there wasn’t a slew of new announcements we couldn’t demo, but there were lots of updates to last year’s announcements. In some ways it felt a little like I/O 2016 revisited: Assistant hit iOS, Daydream standalone headsets are on the way, Google Home got new features, Android Instant Apps are now available for everyone, and so on. But what about the event itself? How did Google handle the criticisms of last year and was it any better this time around? See all our Google I/O 2017 coverage The answer is a resounding yes. For a variety of reasons, a lot of folks won’t ever get the chance to attend Google I/O in person. So we put together a short walkthrough video to give you a feel for what it’s like to be on the ground at the Shoreline Amphitheatre at the Mountain View Googleplex. But what that video won’t show is the blazing sun, the energy and excitement of the attendees and the sense of community that permeates the entire space. As journalists we may be outside the core developer audience, but we orbit the same Google nucleus and enjoy the event in equal measure. Chief among the issues with last year’s I/O was the question of seating. There was insufficient seating at sessions, no overflow spaces, and no reserved places. This year it was possible to reserve a seat for all sessions: so you knew ahead of time that you were either guaranteed a seat or that you’d have to take your chances with the standby line. The stages were huge with a lot of available seating and if you were unable to get in you could simply grab a patch of grass in the shade and watch the livestream. The event itself was also a lot more polished. The Burning Man-esque vibe was absent this time around with a lot more focus put on the sessions, keynotes and office hours than on the festival atmosphere. For some this may have been a little disappointing, but for me it felt a lot more appropriate for the event. The upshot of the lack of distractions was that the focus instead became the people – both Googlers and attendees – and the opportunities for them to meet one another and exchange ideas. There was also a lot more shaded areas for chilling out and catching up with people. While lining up still typically occurred in the sun, which got increasingly hotter as the week progressed, the session lines moved very fast and at no time did I feel at risk of sun stroke like I did on the daily last year. Likewise, you could hardly walk ten meters without stumbling across a water station or bucket of icy cold drinks, so staying hydrated was a breeze. At I/O 2017 it was also a lot easier to find stages, the food lines moved quickly thanks to pre-prepared plates (as opposed to ordering from disparate food trucks last year), there were stanchens for more orderly queueing and everywhere you looked were signs showing what was coming up next, what was inside or where to go for the thing you were after. Across the board, everything felt much better organized and less slapped together this year. There was a nice parallel between seeing Google’s progress with managing the event as there was in hearing about its progress on the topic of each session. While Google still can’t do too much about the California heat in mid-May, it can be as prepared as best as possible (as can attendees). All in all, there was a lot less to complain about this year, even if the major unexpected announcements were a little thinner on the ground. Google deserves a real pat on the back for sticking with Shoreline and for listening to the feedback from last year’s attendees. Google I/O 2017 is an event no one will forget, but this year it’ll be for all the right reasons. If you weren’t able to make it to this year’s Google I/O, we wanted to give you a chance to own a limited edition piece of it. Watch the video above to find out what you can win and how to enter!

Instead, what grabbed traders' attention was the stampede into Hong Kong-listed mainland Internet giant Tencent Holdings, which recorded a 58 per cent jump in its first-quarter profit to 14.48 billion yuan (S$2.9 billion). The resulting run-up in its shares caused Tencent to hit an intra-day record high of HK$271 and a market capitalisation of HK$2.6 trillion (S$463 billion), catapulting it to among the top 10 most valuable firms in the world. Even so, some investors may not have heard of Tencent, but many would have been familiar with its mobile chat service WeChat that now has nearly one billion active users a month. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Like US tech giants Alphabet (Google's parent) and Facebook, Tencent has been enjoying a sharp run-up this year. The stellar results confirm that its winning streak is likely to continue for now, despite persistent concerns from some quarters of a slowdown in China's growth. One common trait shared by all these firms is their ability to deploy far fewer assets and human resources than the traditional bricks-and-mortar companies to expand their businesses once they have achieved a certain scale in their operations. Mascots of Tencent's mobile chat service WeChat inside Guangzhou's TIT Creativity Industry Zone. With a market value of over $460 billion, Tencent is now worth almost half as much as all the companies listed on the Singapore Exchange, even though it has been listed for only 13 years. It underlines the big challenge faced by bourses everywhere to attract these winners early enough, if only to stay relevant to investors who trade in them, says the writer. PHOTO: REUTERS What is interesting to note is that at the recent shareholder meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, its boss - the legendary investment guru Warren Buffett - bemoaned the fact that he failed to spot these winners early on and invest in them. Mr Buffett has remained true to his lifelong philosophy of investing only in what he can understand, but admitted that he should have understood Google. Berkshire's auto insurance unit, Geico, had been an early customer of Google and had to pay the search engine US$10 (S$13.90) to US$11 per click on its ads, which explains Mr Buffett's anguish in failing to spot the trend. As he observed: "Any time you're paying somebody US$10 or US$11 when somebody just punches a little something which has no cost at all, that's a good business and you have never seen a business like it." So one reason to want to buy these tech firms, based on Mr Buffett's investment philosophy, is the sustainable moat they have created for themselves to enable them to scale up their business without requiring huge amounts of capital. But the more important reason to want to get our hands on them is the fabulous treasure trove of consumer information they have built up on shopping, eating, travelling and wealth. The Economist magazine recently described data as the most valuable commodity in the economy we live in, giving enormous power to the companies with access to it. As it observed, any time a person goes for a run, watches TV or even sits in a car, he leaves a digital trace. And as more devices from watches to cars are connected to the Internet, that generates even more data. By collecting more and more data, a firm has more scope to improve its products and attract more users which, in turn, generates even more data. The access to data also acts as protective moats against encroachment by other firms eyeing their turf, enabling them to head off any potential rival early on, or an unexpected technological shift which may hurt their business. The Economist notes that this gives them a "God-eye view" over their markets and beyond. "They can see when a new product or service gains traction, allowing them to copy it or simply buy the upstart before it becomes too great a threat," it said. This helps explain why Facebook was willing to fork out such a big sum - US$22 billion - to buy the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014 even though it had no revenue to speak of. However, one worry is whether these tech firms are becoming too big for their own good, leaving our economy dominated by a few Internet giants with the means to control every aspect of our lives. So far, their dominance hasn't worked out to the detriment of consumers. In fact, many services offered by the likes of Google, Facebook and Tencent are free. I am confident that even with their access to data that provides them with barriers against potential rivals and early warning systems, the market is still sufficiently big and fragmented enough for a fresh company to capture a big slice. So far, the successes of companies such as Tencent and Alibaba are mostly confined to China, even though they are making enormous efforts to make inroads outside their home turf. The success of upstarts like Snapchat suggests new entrants can still make waves, despite the dominance of Facebook in social media networking. And the ever-cleverer ways in which data is being mined means that we may find ourselves landed with a host of new products we may not even have thought of. Just look at the app economy launched by the smartphone revolution. Even Apple's late boss, Mr Steve Jobs, might not have grasped the enormity of the changes which he had unleashed. Stock exchanges get their bread and butter business from earning a fee in clearing the trades on the stocks listed on them - and one of their priorities is to attract as many of these potential winners as possible. There is one other lesson from Tencent: Unlike Facebook and Google, which have more than one class of shares because such a choice is available in the US, Tencent has only one class because the Hong Kong stock market does not provide for a multiple share structure. Yet, despite this purported handicap, founder Pony Ma has been able to grow his firm to become one of the most valuable on the planet, and doing so without the fear of being taken to task for making tough decisions by shareholders hell-bent on short-term gains. It runs contrary to the argument that dual-class listings are a necessary evil in order to get big tech start-ups to list because their founders may be worried that they will end up pandering to the mood swings of short-term investors rather than focusing on long-term performance. With a market value of over $460 billion, Tencent is now worth almost half as much as all the companies listed on the Singapore Exchange, even though it has been listed for only 13 years. It underlines the big challenge faced by bourses everywhere to attract these winners early enough, if only to stay relevant to investors who trade in them.

The Google app’s on-screen cards create a personalised feed of information you care about, like traffic and weather, and the feed is updated regularly over your internet connection. However, the service has been hampered in the past by things like glitches on the Google side of things, incorrect Google Account settings or device problems. Earlier this month, many users began to complain on forums, blogs and social media about getting the “Failed to load cards” message in the Google app, as well as similar problems with the home screen in the Google Play app. The problem has not affected all users (some of whom suspect testing by Google as a cause), but if it has not resolved itself by now, you can try the known workarounds. On your Android device, open the Settings app, go to the Application Manager and select the Google app. Tap the Manage Space button and on the next screen, tap Clear Google Search Data; menu names may vary slightly depending on the Android version. If your cards still fail to load, try turning your Google app feed off and on again in the settings. Deleting and reinstalling the Google app may also fix the issue, but you may have to redo some of your feed preferences. Changing your Google preferences can affect your cards. If you have recently changed your account settings (like by turning off Web & App Activity), change the settings back to see if your feed is restored. Q: I saw somebody in a restaurant using a smartphone to magnify the tiny type on the menu. What app is that and can I get it for my new iPhone? The App Store has several programs that borrow the iPhone’s camera and use it to display a magnified view of objects in front of the device, but the current iOS 10 system software comes with its own Magnifier function. This tool is part of Apple’s suite of Accessibility features. To use the Magnifier on an iOS 10 device, open the Settings icon and select General. On the General settings screen, choose Accessibility and then Magnifier. On the next screen, tap the button to the On position. Press the Home button to return to the iPhone’s main screen. Now, when you want to read the fine print on the page or need to get a close-up look at something, press the iPhone’s Home button three times quickly. This triple-click action (also known as the Accessibility Shortcut) brings up the Magnifier and any other preconfigured functions geared toward users with impaired vision, hearing or motor skills. When you have the Magnifier open in a dark restaurant, tap the lightning bolt icon on the screen to turn on the iPhone’s flash for a steady stream of bright light. Tap the Filters icon to change the colour cast on the screen. You can zoom in by dragging the slider on screen and tap the padlock icon to lock the camera’s focus. If you want to freeze the frame, tap the round camera shutter button. Once the frame is frozen, you can zoom to the part you want to see better. Press your finger on the screen and select Save Image if you want to keep a copy in your Camera Roll. Tap the shutter button to unfreeze the frame, and press the Home button to leave the Magnifier. The iOS Accessibility settings have a Zoom feature for making things larger on the iPhone screen itself. For Android users, Google includes a similar feature and Microsoft’s software for its Windows phones has a Magnifier, too.

That was Google’s situation recently, when it held its annual conference for developers on a perfect spring day in the outdoor amphitheater adjacent to its Silicon Valley campus. There were no headline-making announcements, no big reveal of the sort that Steve Jobs would make (iPod and iPhone) in his glory years at Apple. The tech world moves too fast these days for companies to save products for an annual event; they appear when they are finished. But the conference must go on anyway. Now in its 11th year, Google I/O — short for input/output — offers a chance for the search and advertising giant to broadcast its ambitions. The event, which lasts three days, is really for the benefit of independent software engineers who work on Google technology. But the two-hour opening keynote is closely watched by the tech media. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, began by talking about Google’s impressive reach. Seven of its products have more than one billion users each. The Android operating system software is on more than two billion devices. Google’s ambition, as Pichai made clear, is to knit all those devices and services together. A Google user — which means just about everyone, in Google’s vision — will interact with the company all day long and do it so seamlessly that they barely notice it. The smartphone, which allowed people to slip the chains of the desktop, first pushed Google in this direction. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are now speeding it along. “In an AI-first world, we are rethinking all our products,” Pichai said. The future that the company sketched out was one in which people communicate with their Google devices by talking to them rather than typing. And the machines will anticipate trouble without your asking. They will warn you, for instance, that you need to leave for your child’s soccer game 15 minutes early because there is heavy traffic. Simply pointing a phone at a restaurant would bring up reviews of it. And a search for a small product — a screwdriver, say — in a vast hardware store would be enabled by what Google calls Visual Position Service (VPS). “GPS gets you to the door, and then VPS can get you the exact item you’re looking for,” said Clay Bavor, Google’s virtual reality team leader. With an audio interface, VPS would be a gift to the vision-impaired. What could possibly stop Google? For one thing, the ambitions of a few competitors. Google Home, introduced at I/O last year, was rushed out to compete with Amazon’s Echo. While Google does not release sales figures, analysts say Home lags far behind the Echo, which recently announced new features that Home does not have. Perhaps Google can catch up or perhaps Home will become another Google Buzz, a social network that failed a few years ago. The same caution goes for Google’s efforts in virtual reality. It is developing its first stand-alone headsets, done in partnership with Qualcomm, Lenovo and HTC, which will be released this fall. But Facebook and Samsung already have their own well-publicized VR initiatives. At the end of the keynote, Pichai discussed a new initiative called Google for Jobs that will pull data from partner sites to making job-hunting easier. That makes another battle joined.

I have two Google Homes and I can't wait to take advantage of some of these new features. Lars Jeppesen I am contemplating buying a tv (haven't had one for years) just to use some of the new cool visual features of Home (I have 3 of them). Any recommendations for someone who wants to use it as a casting device and doesn't need a tv tuner (or crappy smart tv features).. just a very good 4k panel without any fuss? James Bryant Hisense make tvs that are considered some of the best you can get for the money. Generally quite affordable too. I believe it's the 7000 series. Lars Jeppesen Thanks, will have a look jonzey231 I got a 55" Vizio E Series on Black Friday with Chromecast Built-In. It's 4K, no HDR, though. There's no tuner so I did have to buy an external one, but that was a blessing in disguise because now I have it running into my TV via HDMI which I like. Got it for like $350-$400ish. Picture is fantastic, especially for what I paid. And I love that even if the TV is off (standby mode), I can just cast something from my phone and it turns the TV on and just starts playing. It's small, but it's convenient. Plus, casting is even in 4K if you're using Netlfix or whatever else with the 4K subscription. Lars Jeppesen Thanks. Is that the tv one of the "all about android" show cast got as well? He likes it a lot. I prefer without a tv tuner as I cut tv signal years ago. Drakenoid That's your best option imo, it works really well. Lars Jeppesen F*uck .. Vizio only sells in the US.. I'm european.. dammit dammit dammit I was getting fired up :) abc Me too. I'll probably pick one up in two to three years when it comes out of beta. Rik Wall The GBoard auto translate feature blew me away personally. Evgany It's been available in beta for months. Rik Wall I think I need to join the beta LOL OrionBeast begs a question, how do you join a beta? (for iOS?). joke: buy android phone. pls. don't downvote <3 Daniel I'M DOWNVOTING RIGHT NOW! JK Pls don't downvote me. Serge Cebrian Downvoting ... Plz dont Downv..... Nah I don't care downvote me into oblivion Just kidding Don't downvote me Drakenoid It's not just in beta. Тарас Мукин It's not an auto-translate, I believe you mixed up 2 different things in one. If you want to translate -- write actual words in one language and get words in other-- you have to press "translate" and type into field inside keyboard -- translated words will appear in main field. But what happens automathicaly is phonetic input -- you write hindi words using english letters, basically transcription. It has to be specific phonetic keyboard layout. The same thing is used in Japanese input for a long time already, as long as their alphabet (kana) is too big to fit in QWERTY-like layout. Paul_Werner Do you know how to have this working now in GBoard? I don't know if it's possible but it'd be nice to test out the transcription feature. I am already on beta and have the translation feature Drakenoid Go into gboard settings>languages you'll find the options there, it should be obvious there. OrionBeast It's good to see Google integrating their services quite nicely. Especially with all the AI features coming along quite well.

Daniel That's happening in Q4 JG When they were talking about Android Go and she said something along the lines of "While Google Go-ifies our apps, we're opening it up to you, the developers to" I had to laugh... Google has been stressing Material Design as a unified design scheme for how many years now, and they still haven't managed to implement it across all of their properties yet... And that's basically just cosmetic changes. Making a Go app should require a little more work re-designing the app to use less bandwidth and local storage etc. [* and considering how well Allo turned out as a re-design of Hangouts ... but that's another story] Raviteja Rachuri The google lens and Suggested sharing are the things that caught my attention the most.

I/O every time I read this headline this song pops in my head. netsurfer912 A bit weak, but mostly welcome. Jadephyre All I took away from that is Google giving rooted users the finger. Why even still use Android if they start pulling the same shit Apple is doing? Roy I'm happy they doing that. Android never was about open in every way for rooted users. It's about everybody can do whatever they want with the OS In simple way that not like Apple. Now that qwllity of the will go up. And the developers will be more focus on great apps on great OS. I'm sorry for you guys but you're not even 1% of the 2 billion users of Android.

Image: pete pachal/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-05-21 15:31:56 UTC If you use Google Photos, you know the service is so much more than just the best way to store and back up all your photos and videos into the cloud. Using advanced machine learning, Google Photos can intelligently identify people, places, and things — and it's all easily searchable. One of the cooler things in Google Photos is the Assistant (not to be confused with Google's other Assistant on Android and Google Home). SEE ALSO: How to get all of your photos into Google Photos In the Google Photos app on iOS and Android, the Assistant is a card-based panel that does three things: Shows you the status of your backup. Automatically creates "movies" based on related video clips. Creates "animations" using batches of bursted photos. (You can also create your own animations by manually selecting between 2-50 photos, but the end result is the same — you still get a GIF file.) I'm constantly amazed by how great the automatically generated animations are, and it sure beats using a separate app like Burstio to convert your burst photos into a video or a GIF. There's just one little thing: While you can download and share the animated GIFs online to Twitter, Giphy or wherever using a computer, sharing GIFs natively to Instagram is still impossible without first converting the file into a video. Here's how to do that quickly and easily: For iOS On iOS, you'll need to use another app like GifLab (free) to convert the GIF into a video. To find your animations, type "animations" into the Photos search bar in the iOS or Android app. Then, select your animation. (These are animations you've saved. Animations that Google Photos created but you didn't save within 30 days of their creation will not appear and are lost forever, so save them when they're created.) Tap the "•••" located in the upper right corner and then tap "Download" to save the GIF. Then, open up GifLab and do the following: Step 1: Open GifLab and select "GIF to Instagram." Step 2: Select your GIF and adjust the playback speed. Step 3: Tap "Save and share on Instagram." For Android On Android, things are even easier and you can share GIFs directly from Google Photos to Instagram, as the app automatically converts the GIF into a video, no extra app required. Select your Google Photos animation GIF as outlined above and then tap the share icon in the lower left. Select Instagram as the app (obviously, have it installed and logged in) to share the GIF. Once the GIF's been auto converted into a video, you'll be taken Instagram where you can select a filter and add a caption.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 112 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares294 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? Maxr1998 1) No, it isn't. Just look at Linux/Windows. There you need root/admin access for installing or updating applications all the time. You type in your password (on Linux) or click grant, done! Same with using e.g. SuperSu on Android, you grant the su request, done. 2) Google doesn't use it to protect YOUR data, they provide it as DRM method for 3rd parties - basically "locking down" your device. 3) Uhmmm.. Nope? If you root your device, apps can't just use the su rights without your permission - except if they use an exploit, which would also work on an unrooted device. And if you yourself give a malware app su rights because you couldn't understand the situation, it's completely your own fault. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky What can I say, I have a VERY cynical view of the world. This world is going to hell is a handcart and every day it's picking up speed. trparky What can I say, I have a VERY cynical view of the world. This world is going to hell is a handcart and every day it's picking up speed. Every day we're going faster and faster down that hill straight to hell. Those who have the money may survive but the rest of us poor slobs have no hope of surviving what's coming next. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. someone755 I don't think that's true -- new Android users will soon enough become old ones, and with that they'll learn that the platform (especially update-wise) is a mess without some system privileges beyond those needed to change the display brightness. Not being to use the core functions of the ecosystem that we pay to use because we decide we deserve to have more control over the devices we pay for is absolutely on Apple's level, if not made worse because of the implication that this OS is somehow different from iOS. Windows Vista was a revolutionary piece of software, and people hated it. Why? Because what was expected from Microsoft was both huge change as well as keeping everything as it is -- and Vista was exactly that: an OS modern enough to be the core basis for Windows 7, and an inspiration for features several years into the future (Vista pioneered almost every feature that W7 had), with many similarities to Windows XP. But naturally because of the expectations, the OS failed miserably, being fondly remembered by nobody (with the exception of a few people, including myself). The ones who vote and voice their opinion are not always the brightest of people. Google's Treble is sure to mitigate Android's fragmentation *to some extent*, but it'll take several years for it to reach the majority of devices (based on the data that Nougat, today, works on 10% of devices, including custom ROM-ed ones, which, when talking about custom Android O ROMs, won't count towards the number of devices supporting Treble). We can't say this is unexpected -- after all, Google does bring features into Android that enthusiasts developed before official implementation. But this is a moot point if we consider that these things usually take at least three years. Tethering, using camera flash as a torch, quick settings and editing quick settings, even night light -- these are all root features that, when first introduced, were community hacks to improve Android devices, and they are all part of Google's Android (AOSP, even) today. If Google discourages rooting, they discourage development of future Android features, which are, historically, largely taken from the operating system's community of developers and enthusiasts. If that is how things must be in pursuit of a false sense of security and tighter control over the platform in the hopes of improving its quality, so be it. But saying that this is the platform I once adored is false -- if anything, this is its polar opposite; something we knew back in 2011 as "iOS". Corbin Baxter Android can still be rooted, and I don't think that Google is going to take that away. someone755 They aren't taking away the ability to root, no. They are, however, taking away the incentive to root, as well as root users' access to services they pay (or have paid) for. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. someone755 I respectfully disagree. There is no loss in stability aside from the forced Knox/SafetyNet/whatever software alerts from OEMs and Google, and there's definitely no loss in security -- if anything, the system is more secure because of my control over apps' privileges (i.e. I am free to control what apps do on my device, including stopping data theft by apps like Facebook etc). Why Google would have to be responsible for what a person does with their phone is beyond me -- the warranty doesn't cover it, and there are warnings of dos and don'ts plastered most everywhere online. (I'd very much like to say here that if you can't follow simple instructions you should go back to using tin cans on a string, but I realize that way 90% of the population would be excluded from the money making machine.) Simply put, I don't understand why Google would care over what the user can or can't do, as long as the user isn't somehow hurting the company (which, with root alone, they aren't and can't). Corbin Baxter You have a good point... bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. My1 if you are rooted and wanna watch netflix on mobile, you have not much choice. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. Jan-Lk Else OEMs don't care about customers, they care about money. And with Windows the OEMs don't need to provide updates themselves. trparky So why should I care about them? Why should I buy their products? Why should I give even one red cent of my money? That's right, I shouldn't and you shouldn't either. The only way to teach these companies is to hurt them where it hurts the most, in their bank accounts. A year or two of reduced profits from less device sales should send a clear message to them that unless they start supporting older devices (for at least three years) we won't buy their new devices, simple as that. I myself voted with my wallet, I bought an iPhone. I'm guaranteed updates the same day that everyone else gets the updates. I'm guaranteed updates for at least four years. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Obviously, the notion of self-diagnosis - or, even more worryingly, internet diagnosis, can be dangerous. After all, it's likely that every time you enter "I've got a headache" into Google, you're swiftly informed you're about to drop down dead imminently. But you don't have to take notice anymore. Health messages can be baffling to say the least. So here, we've de-mystified some of the most common health phrases. 1 Why are some foods ‘super’? “There’s no legal or scientific ­definition for a ‘superfood’ – it’s a term generally used to mean a food that has a high concentration of one, or several, micronutrients,” says registered ­dietician Ursula Arens. “For instance, brazil nuts have a uniquely high source of selenium and tomatoes are rich in lycopene. "Oily fish contains long chain omega 3 fatty acids while spinach and kale are high in xanthine. "It is possible to get some of these nutrients from other foods, but usually at much lower concentrations.” Read More More than 1,000 classic cars and bikes to go on show 2 What’s so bad about free radicals? Experts say the simplest way to describe free radicals in action is to cut open an apple and watch it go brown. These potentially dangerous by-products are caused when your body ‘burns’ glucose for energy. And when we get stressed, smoke, eat badly or sunbathe, they get out of control and start attacking the body’s own cells (a process called oxidation). Research shows excessive oxidation in the body promotes cell ageing and contributes towards the development of chronic diseases. Read More Patients warned to expect delays at Nuneaton's hospital after cyber attack 3 And what’s so good about antioxidants? The body produces an armoury of antioxidants to defend itself against – and neutralise – free ­radicals, explains Kate Cook, nutritionist and founder of thenutritioncoach.co.uk. Our ability to produce antioxidants is controlled by genetic make-up and is also influenced by environmental factors, such as diet and smoking. You can help your body to defend itself by increasing intake of antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C and E, selenium and beta-carotene, which are found in fruit, vegetables and whole (unprocessed) fresh foods. Read More First look at plans for £50million redevelopment in Leamington town centre 4 Does the pelvis really have a floor? The pelvic ‘floor’ is actually a diaphragm – similar to the one under the lungs, says Sammy Margo, a ­chartered physiotherapist. “It’s made up of several muscles which form a sling suspension sheet with openings – not a solid floor – to essentially support your urinary and reproductive organs.” There are three main stages in a woman’s life when the pelvic ‘floor’ is at risk: during pregnancy, after giving birth and after the menopause (when hormonal changes can affect it). That’s why it’s so important to keep the pelvic floor strong to prevent urinary leaking and womb prolapse. 5 High GI or low GI – what’s better? “GI stands for glycaemic index and refers to how quickly or slowly a food “burns” in your body to produce energy,” explains Kate Cook. “High GI food burns quickly. Low GI food burns more slowly and helps maintain blood sugar levels or energy throughout the day.” Low GI foods are usually natural (unprocessed) ‘dense’ foods, (such as lentils and whole grains) and protein food (animal protein, beans, dairy). Low GI is better for most people most of the time, but high GI foods can be vital for diabetics and athletes. 6 Should we all aim for eight hours’ sleep? Not necessarily, explains Lisa Artis of sleepcouncil.org.uk. “Some of us function well on just six to seven hours while others need eight to nine. "One size doesn’t fit all, so if you feel OK, stop worrying that you haven’t had enough. "However, if you feel sleepy, exhausted and unable to function then chances are you need more sleep.” 7 How much exercise should I be doing? “It depends what you want to achieve,” says Joanna Hall, founder of walkactive.com. “If your goal is to improve health and cut risk of 20 known diseases, then the goal is a minimum of 5,000 steps per day. "This is where the Government ­recommendation of 30 minutes a day, five days a week comes in. “If your goal is to improve ­cardiovascular fitness you should also be doing three ‘booster’ sessions of more intensive exercise – 30 to 60 minutes of brisk walking, jogging, swimming, fitness classes etc.” Read More There is an exact time you should go to sleep if you need to wake up at 7am for work 8 Is it better to apply ice or heat after an injury? “For the first 36 to 48 hours and if the area is hot, red and swollen, use ice,” says Sammy Margo. “When the inflammation calms, use heat to increase circulation and mobility.” Rather than ice cubes in a tea towel, try topical rubs that simulate the cold sensation of ice. 9 Why hasn’t there been a cure for common colds? “The common cold is not a single disease but a mix of symptoms caused by more than 200 different viruses – which are evolving much more quickly than our defences against them,” explains Professor Ron Eccles, director of the Common Cold Centre in Cardiff. “Even if an effective medication were found, it will be reserved for hospital use to treat life-threatening infections.

These include ventures that send satellites into the space to study the changing earth, firms that convert traditional manufacturing plants into smart factories and start-ups that are simulating entire cities. Google is offering cloud technology that combines a large amount of storage and computing. It then sells it to customers who may want to enhance or set up new data centres. Planet Labs, Inc, a start-up which is on a mission to image the entire Earth every day, and make the global change visible said that it has switched to Google Cloud to host its imagery and do data processing. “There are a handful of companies that can offer storage and processing, we are really impressed by Google Cloud’s core technology,” said Will Marshall, co-founder and chief executive of Planet Labs, at Google Cloud Next conference held recently in San Francisco. Natural disasters Founded in 2010 by a team of ex-NASA scientists, Planet Labs operates the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites. These satellites are collecting a new data set with real-world applications such as tracking natural resources, quantifying agricultural yields and assisting first responders after natural disasters. To image the whole of Earth every day means preparing for 7 to 10 terabytes of data daily. Google Cloud now hosts this growing photography repository and the data processing for Planet Labs. “We have the capacity to image every point on the earth every single day and the sea changes that happens. We see every port, every city, every farm and every forest,” said Mr. Marshall. In February, with the help from Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO), the California-based firm successfully launched 88 Dove satellites to orbit. This is the largest satellite constellation ever to reach orbit. These satellites rode aboard ISRO’s workhorse — the polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV rocket) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. Planet Labs has now introduced a tool called ‘Planet Explorer Beta’ that aims to provide data to individuals, small and medium-sized businesses, developers and researchers around the globe. Simulating cities Google also provides its cloud platform to Improbable, a London-based start-up co-founded by Indian-origin entrepreneur Herman Narula. It is dedicated to building technology to enable powerful virtual worlds and simulations designed to help solve previously stubborn problems. In gaming and entertainment, this enables the creation of richer and more immersive virtual worlds. For instance, top studios are building their products on Improbable’s distributed operating system, SpatialOS. These include top video games like Worlds Adrift, Rebel Horizons and Chronicles of Elyria. Improbable has now taken a huge leap of simulating entire cities that could impact everything ranging from city planning to healthcare. At the Google Cloud conference, Mr. Narula said that Improbable has built a complete simulation of an entire British City, in conjunction with a public sector partner. This includes its telco and transport network, power grid, sewage systems, housing demographics and even the way in which people move around and interact with the city. “This is the largest simulation of its kind, ever created,” said Mr. Narula, chief executive at Improbable. The company intends to foster a community where developers can share code, framework and build and create new services and businesses. Mr.Narula said the age of closed systems and trying, in effect, developers into committing to a closed ecosystem were over. “We can’t succeed unless you succeed and I think Google recognises that,” he said. Smart factories Manufacturing is one of the most important sectors of the U.S. economy. The gross output of U.S. manufacturing industries was $6.2 trillion in 2015, about 36% of U.S. gross domestic product. But these industries have less access to the new technological advancements in the information technology sector, according to Oden Technologies, a leading industrial Internet of Things venture. The New York-based firm is betting big on changing this and it runs its entire platform on the Google cloud platform. Using a combination of IoT — a technology where devices communicate with each other intelligently, wireless connectivity, and big data, Oden is helping manufacturers enhance production efficiency. “We probably wouldn’t be comfortable scaling up to thousands and thousands of factories, ten and thousands of machines, all streaming data, if we didn’t know we had the infrastructure of Google to allow us to do that,” said Willem Sundblad, founder and chief executive of Oden Technologies. For example, Google’s cloud platform provides the base for obtaining and storing data collated by Oden’s wireless devices. It captures and stores about 10 million metrics on each manufacturing line per day. This includes highly granular details, such as melt profile of the materials and measure of power moving to the machines. The environmental insights like temperature and humidity are also obtained. This way manufacturers can find if there are weather-related impacts on their manufacturing efficiency. In March, Mountain View, California-based Google also acquired Kaggle, a community platform for data scientists. The Kaggle community has used machine learning to grade high school essays, diagnose heart failure and increase the discovery significance of the Higgs-Boson, an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. Making Google Cloud technology available to its community will allow it to offer access to powerful infrastructure and the capability to store and query large data sets. “We are going to enable our community to do far more powerful things,” said Anthony Goldbloom, chief executive of Kaggle.

You have that perfect idea for a service website or blog and want to start development. You know it’s unique and will offer something different — along with copious amounts of value for users. Don’t rush into things; think like an SEO first, with the emphasis on an optimized mobile design. According to Formstack, average smartphone conversion rates are up 64% compared to average desktop conversion rates. That trend will surely continue, and to beat the competition, you must optimize your mobile design for SEO. What will this equate to? More visibility and longer engagement — two vital elements for successful conversions and ROI. To begin, check out these five tips that will make sure your mobile design is SEO-friendly. These are essential not only for success but also for sustainable success, and are must-follows for any digital marketing agency helping companies optimize mobile design for SEO. 1. Lightning Fast Page Speed Every second counts. Nobody wants slow loading times, especially on a mobile device. Many of these pages plagued by slow mobile speeds feature valuable content, but users move on quickly after stumbling on slow pages. The quicker the mobile experience, the more engagement you’ll receive. To begin with, analyze every image and every piece of JavaScript and CSS, and compress when needed. Compress larger images when possible; every byte counts on mobile when it comes to speed. Also, utilize your cache for things that load constantly, such as a logo. When you cache a logo, you’ll save precious download time, which increases the overall speed of your app. A good rule of thumb is to set all static resources’ cache lifetime once a week. As for other third-party resources like widgets and ads, cache lifetime should be set for one day. And don’t forget to minimize as many redirects as possible. These redirects create additional HTTP requests, which increase your page’s load time. Google recommends sending users with mobile user agents to the mobile equivalent URL without intermediate redirects. Remember also that lightning-fast page speeds on mobile help with conversion and customer satisfaction. The average mobile website load times for bounced sessions were about 2.5 seconds slower than non-bounced sessions, according to Think with Google. 2. Beware of Pop-Ups Pages that show intrusive interstitials provide a poor user experience, according to Google. This is why Google now penalizes businesses with mobile pop-ups, which was part of the January 10 algorithm update. Due to the small size of mobile screens, search engines see these penalties as imperative to provide better UX for users. This should prompt you to limit the use of any pop-ups. Some pop-ups, like age verification boxes and smaller banners that don’t obscure a large part of the screen, are fine to run. But if a pop-up covers main content or is a standalone one that needs to be dismissed before content is displayed, this will have a drastic effect not only on UX but also on SEO. Think of how many times you exited a website when this happened. Don’t repeat this same mistake. 3. Design for Big Fingers Your mobile-first design should have touch screen navigation that is easily scrolled with fingers that are either too big or too small. Think about the size of a thumb and index finger, and make sure your mobile design caters to all for a smoother UX. The smoother the UX, the more engagement, which means the better the SEO. 4. Titles & Meta Descriptions Yes, SEOs know the importance of action-driven titles and meta descriptions that include target keywords for websites. But how about the way they display on mobile? Last May, Google increased mobile title tags to 78 characters — eight more than the recommended character count for desktop. But you’re better off sticking to 70 characters, considering you don’t want any title truncated on mobile. Meta descriptions should also be shorter for a truly enhanced mobile experience. Google also kept mobile meta description lengths to around 130 characters but has since increased the amount of meta description text shown on mobile. Regardless, keep things shorter than 130 characters because Google is known to truncate meta descriptions on mobile. Yoast has a perfect solution for those struggling with optimal lengths for either mobile or desktop. Yoast has settings for both desktop and mobile when creating titles, URLs, and meta descriptions so you can optimize each. 5. Simple Design With Clear CTAs Due to screen sizes, simpler is better when it comes to mobile design. Don’t try cramming too much onto a page or user experience will suffer, which goes against any positive SEO practices. Make on-page content short and to the point, and don’t forget to have clear CTAs such as easy-to-find and clickable contact info, including phone number and address. This allows visitors to easily engage, which can help smoothen the flow to conversions. Also, shorten your menu items for mobile, which will help SEO efforts by allowing for easier navigation. You’ve likely seen it numerous times: If there are many menu and sub-menu items, users get confused and quickly lose interest. This usually leads to them quickly tapping out, which lessens your engagement time and in turn destroys SEO efforts. Also, make sure all your contact forms are designed for mobile. This is a common mistake among many companies — even enterprise-level companies. Make sure all contact forms use HTML5 input types, which will automatically register the correct keyboard for mobile browsers, which have various on-screen keyboards for various types of data. Conclusion As mobile continues its natural trend towards more users over desktop, having a mobile-first design with SEO at the forefront is imperative to success. Algorithms are constantly changing to provide a better user experience for mobile users and rewarding sites that have an SEO-friendly mobile design. Start with the tips above and keep up-to-date on all search engine algorithm changes regarding mobile to remain proactive.

Image: pete pachal/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-05-21 15:31:56 UTC If you use Google Photos, you know the service is so much more than just the best way to store and back up all your photos and videos into the cloud. Using advanced machine learning, Google Photos can intelligently identify people, places, and things — and it's all easily searchable. One of the cooler things in Google Photos is the Assistant (not to be confused with Google's other Assistant on Android and Google Home). SEE ALSO: How to get all of your photos into Google Photos In the Google Photos app on iOS and Android, the Assistant is a card-based panel that does three things: Shows you the status of your backup. Automatically creates "movies" based on related video clips. Creates "animations" using batches of bursted photos. (You can also create your own animations by manually selecting between 2-50 photos, but the end result is the same — you still get a GIF file.) I'm constantly amazed by how great the automatically generated animations are, and it sure beats using a separate app like Burstio to convert your burst photos into a video or a GIF. There's just one little thing: While you can download and share the animated GIFs online to Twitter, Giphy or wherever using a computer, sharing GIFs natively to Instagram is still impossible without first converting the file into a video. Here's how to do that quickly and easily: For iOS On iOS, you'll need to use another app like GifLab (free) to convert the GIF into a video. To find your animations, type "animations" into the Photos search bar in the iOS or Android app. Then, select your animation. (These are animations you've saved. Animations that Google Photos created but you didn't save within 30 days of their creation will not appear and are lost forever, so save them when they're created.) Tap the "•••" located in the upper right corner and then tap "Download" to save the GIF. Then, open up GifLab and do the following: Step 1: Open GifLab and select "GIF to Instagram." Step 2: Select your GIF and adjust the playback speed. Step 3: Tap "Save and share on Instagram." For Android On Android, things are even easier and you can share GIFs directly from Google Photos to Instagram, as the app automatically converts the GIF into a video, no extra app required. Select your Google Photos animation GIF as outlined above and then tap the share icon in the lower left. Select Instagram as the app (obviously, have it installed and logged in) to share the GIF. Once the GIF's been auto converted into a video, you'll be taken Instagram where you can select a filter and add a caption.

The simple one-to-one video calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple’s FaceTime is currently available for Android and iOs users. “Duo takes the complexity out of video calling so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are,” Google said in its blogsite. When a user signs up, the app checks user’s phone number then sends a confirmation text. The said app does not require a user to sign up a Google account. Duo seamlessly switches between mobile data and Wi-Fi without dropping the call. It also comes with a feature called Knock Knock which lets the user to see live video of the caller before answering the call. In addition, the Duo is built with an emphasis on privacy and security, and all calls are end-to-end encrypted. “Users are reluctant to video call because they don’t know if the other person is on the right network, the right device or it’s a good time to call. We’ve tried to remove all that friction and make it feel like an invitation, not an interruption when someone calls you,” Amity Fulay, Google’s group manager for communications said in a theguardian.comreport. Google said that their latest application will be live worldwide in the next few days.

Very afraid Commentary: Google is crushing Siri and dominating the smart home, but Apple has a chance to strike back in June. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Mobile by Jessica Dolcourt May 21, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @jdolcourt Google revealed a cascade of exciting innovations to its Google universe this week at the annual I/O developer conference. Apple should be quaking in its boots. The search and software giant is making tremendous strides in AI through Assistant; image search and detection through Google Lens; web search through Instant Apps; and search through Jobs on Google. In other words, Google's ecosystem is positioned to run circles around Apple's, whose tightly integrated software and hardware have failed to innovate at Google's pace when it comes to Siri, VR, the smart home and car dashboards. (More on these below.) Enlarge Image OK, Apple, ecosystem's in your court. CNET While Google's approach, which draws on deep databases of information, wants to own the platforms that other companies build upon, Apple prefers to control a complete, reliable package -- and that historically means it takes longer to get everything "right". In a few weeks at Apple's developer conference on June 5, it'll have the chance to swing back at Google (and a rejuvenated Microsoft) with its own advancements in iOS for the iPhone, Macbook, Siri AI, watch and maybe even the smart home. But Google has thrown down the gauntlet for Apple in a big way this week. Here's why Apple should be worried -- and why the company needs to bring its A game to WWDC in June. As of today, Google beats Apple in... Virtual assistant: Google's voice search tool has long outpaced Apple's Siri. It's more accurate and gives better responses more often than not. The next-gen Google Assistant will soon let you type queries and identify objects with Google Lens (below). You might soon order lunch after having a conversation with Assistant. It's coming to the iPhone, too. Home: Google Home just got a raft of exciting features that leapfrogs it ahead of even Amazon's Echo family. To wit: it'll now personalize responses based on who's talking to it, and has introduced hands-free calling. Apple has its HomeKit integration, but we're still waiting for a living room hub like Google Home to tie it all together. (Rumors are, it will come.) Google Assistant is your new bartender At Google I/O, CNET's Andrew Gebhart shows us how Google Assistant is being integrated into everyday devices like cocktail mixers. by Andrew Gebhart 1:35 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Images: There are a few debatably cool updates to Google Photos, but the most exciting change by far revolves around Google Lens, which basically identifies objects and places seen through the camera. Google Lens will integrate first with Google Photos and Google Assistant. VR and AR: Apple is rumored to put alternate reality into the next iPhone camera, but Google already has a dedicated VR headset, VR-ready phones and two AR phones. More from Google I/O 2017 Android O, Google Lens and VR: Everything important from Google I/O Google Photo's AI is better at sharing your photos than you are 5 ways Google Home just got better See all Google I/O 2017 news Chrome: The browser syncs with mobile and is available on more devices (you can't get Apple's Safari browser on Android). Google announced that it's also bringing its Chrome browser to VR. Cars: Android is working on ways to make your car's infotainment system (the stuff behind your dash screen) run on Android from the get-go. This is different from Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both of which change the contents of that screen when you bring your phone into the car. Google is trying to go even deeper. Search and database: Google's main strength is its search tools and enormous database of places and facts. At I/O, it announced that it'll simplify job listings, making them look like search results. Apple's chance to strike back Google might have a leg up in some areas, but Apple has room to rebound. For example, its messaging apps, from iMessage to Face Time, are stronger than Google's which remain a confusing melange of overlapping and redundant platforms. Apple is better at integrating its software ecosystem across tightly controlled devices, too. 9 Inside Google Tango's augmented reality dreams Also, those Apple devices update to the latest software version without missing a beat -- something that Google, which mostly lets a bunch of partners make devices -- just cannot do. (The newly-announced Project Treble will alleviate some of this, but phone makers that use their own software layers still won't be completely in sync.) To be sure, Apple has a chance to whip up excitement for its next OS, (likely called iOS 11) in a way that Google's new Android O -- while still a useful step forward -- has not. Apple will probably never be able to catch Google in search, but it does have the resources to catch up in some other ways that matter, like VR, AR and the smart home. The countdown is on. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Smart Home Matrix: Want to know what will work best with your smart home? Start here.

Uber issued a warning letter to Anthony Levandowski, saying it would take “adverse employment action against” him if he fails to comply the court’s orders, TechCrunch reported on Saturday. This came after Waymo argued that discovery in the case has been held up by Levandowski refusing to answer questions related to the alleged theft of proprietary data. “Levandowski has repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment in the case, citing the potential for criminal action that could lead to self-incrimination,” the report said. Last week, a judge ordered that Uber “exercise the full extent of (its) corporate, employment, contractual and other authority” to force Levandowski to return any downloaded materials to Waymo. Following that, Uber sent a letter to Levandowski giving him a choice between “deny(ing) ever having taken any downloaded materials from Google” or hand over any materials he might have taken from Google. If he failed to comply, he would risk termination of his employment. Google’s self-driving car company Waymo in February filed a lawsuit against Uber for allegedly stealing trade secrets and technology from it. The lawsuit, filed against Uber’s self-driving vehicle unit Otto, argued that former Waymo manager Levandowski took information when he left the company and later co-founded Otto in January 2016. “We uncovered evidence that Otto and Uber have taken and are using key parts of Waymo’s self-driving technology. Today, we’re taking legal action against Otto and its parent company Uber for misappropriating Waymo trade secrets and infringing our patents,” Waymo wrote in a blog post. The company said it found that six weeks before his resignation, Levandowski downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo’s various hardware systems, including designs of Waymo’s custom-built “Light Detection and Ranging” (LiDAR) and circuit board. “To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop. Once inside, he downloaded 9.7GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation,” the company noted. Levandowski copied the data to an external drive. He later wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints.

The event lasted for three days, and several announcements were made. These would include Google Lens. In this post, let’s talk about the most exciting announcements at Google I/O 2017. 1. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality At this time, Microsoft and Google are competing in providing its consumers with fully functional AR experiences. For Microsoft users, they can have HoloLens. Google enthusiasts could use Project Tango. But the Project Tango is a favorite. With this year’s Google I/O, the company stated that an entirely new device to support the platform would come out. And this new device will have a brighter screen but with a thinner body. It’ll also provide an in-store navigation through Tango devices. In this way, you can go directly to items that you have on your shopping list. The Project Tango team will focus on how to improve the overall customer experience while supporting consumer applications. Tango might include the ability to identify hidden objects in a room, a computer program that can map a room and eliminate all furniture from it. It might also have an app to generate 2D floorplans. The standalone VR devices are also a favorite announcement. A standalone VR device could be a boon to the company and its developers who wish to test the new platform. With it, the company can quickly offer virtual reality to anyone who wants it. That is, you don’t need a specialized phone for it. 2. Flag Apps That Cause Problems During the annual developer conference, the Google Play team announced that it’s going to flag those bad apps. The apps that might get affected would include those that freeze for five seconds or more at a time, crash, lag time, utilize CPU unnecessarily, etc. But Google will provide some tips to assist app makers in improving their apps. They can have metrics dashboard that would also help them decide whether to provide an update or find out why their users are uninstalling their apps. Doing so will allow Android users to only find the best apps on Google Play. 3. Android O Google provided further details on its Android O. Its official release hasn’t announced yet. However, during the I/O developers conference, the company announced that the changes would be subtle. Despite that, the Android O will have several features to look forward to. One of these functions is the emoji. In Android O, you’ll no longer have to miss out on emojis latest releases. Developers will integrate a new library for emojis that fills those missing emojis automatically. It can also understand your photo. With that in mind, it could recommend apps. For example, if the picture is a receipt, Android O will suggest an app for tracking your expenses. This version of Android will also have cleaner icons to match the style of your device. For instance, if your handset has round app icons, apps with square icons will use round ones. The new Android will also put emphasis on notifications. The changes will include snoozing a notification for later and badge notifications. It also redesigns the background colors for notifications but don’t expect them to be extra colorful. The beta is far from ready to be installed on your handset. However, if you want to take a peak, you can get a copy of it through your Nexus or Pixel device. 4. Google Lens As Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai described it, this technology uses your camera and turn it into a search box. Google Lens utilizes machine learning technology to understand your surrounding through the camera of your smartphone. From that understanding, it takes action. During the event, Pichai presented how it could be used to perform everything. It could recognize a flower or a restaurant found on the street. Mostly, it could carry out interesting functions. It could provide you names of a building or translate the written text on a billboard from a foreign language to English. This technology was a favorite among those who attended the event. It’s a feature that could easily make apps more useful. Google Lens indicates that Google wants augmented reality to work exactly what people want the company. That is to retrieve details from the web. The company incorporated Lens in Photos. The said app has half a billion users within just two years after its launch. This integration could assist Google to be more vital to mobile users as it can make mobile apps more essential. Last year, Pichai said that Google wants to be a less device-centric. And Google Lens has proven to be that on mobile. Although the technology used by Lens is not new, it does tell where the company is heading. It also says that Google has a lot of features that want to introduce and integrate into its useful products. 5. Cloud TPUs Google also announced the next generation of Cloud TPUs. It offers remarkable speed and performance to machine learning technology. Every model has 45-teraflop chips that can deliver 180 teraflops of speed. It’ll be available through Google Cloud platform. 6. Google Home Another update to look forward to is the set of new functionalities for Google Home. This voice-enabled speaker will have a proactive support. With it, it won’t need the user to request it. It’ll light up based on notifications it gets. Spotify, Hulu, and HBO Now are now compatible with Google Home devices. By that, it means that you can command Google Assistant to use these apps throughout the house. What’s more is that Google Home will offer hands-free calling feature. It includes free unlimited voice calls. But this feature is only available for calls in the US and Canada. Last year, Google introduced its AI goals. However, it wasn’t clear what it could mean for the company. At that time, people couldn’t see how machine learning could work for Google. But this year’s Google I/O, it’s proven that AI means that Google will be everywhere and developers can interact in several ways.

Hull City 1-5 Spurs (Kane, 73) My days, what a player! Another hat-trick! Admittedly it relies on some quite hilarious defending from Hull, and of course Alli is on hand to profit, poking through. Kane sets himself, then slides home a simple finish. That’s seven goals in his last two games! Kane celebrates scoring his hat-trick.

Swansea City 1-1 West Brom (Ayew, 72) Is Gylfi Sigurdsson football’s best addresser of a dead ball? Payet comes close, but otherwise? Anyway, he swings one into the box, a flick-on takes it to the back post, and Ayew does the rest. Ayew celebrates scoring the equaliser.

Chelsea 2-1 Sunderland (Hazard, 61) This is beautifully taken. Willian brings the ball out of defence and hits Costa, loitering outside the box in the middle. He slides wide to Hazard, who jinks outside his man and zetzes a finish into the far side-netting. Hazard scores the second for Chelsea. Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters Updated at 11.30am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.19am EDT 11:19 GOAL! Watford 0-5 Man City (Jesus, 58) Aguero goes down the right and dinks a cross to the edge of the box where Jesus leaps into a brilliant first touch. He then stays calm to pursue the bouncing ball and lift an excellent finish over Gomes. Jesus scores the fifth.

Sane hares down the left, arcs over a low cross for Aguero - all he needs to do is tap home - but the ball slides off his instep and way, way wide. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.15am EDT 11:15 GOAL! Liverpool 3-0 Middlesbrough (Lallana, 56) Wijnaldum nods down a criss, Lallana bursts onto it, and slides calmly into the far corner. Lallana scores Liverpool’s third.

He leapt into a challenge with Calvert-Lewin, hurting yerman’s Achilles and catching his own leg underneath him. Mertesacker is on, and by the looks of things will play in the Cup Final. Dare Wenger go with three at the back? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.12am EDT 11:12 I guess Guzan should’ve saved that, but still, it was very well done indeed. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.11am EDT 11:11 GOAL! LIVERPOOL ARE GOING INTO THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE! Liverpool 2-0 Middlesbrough (Coutinho, 51) This is a very clever free-kick - it’s right of centre, and Guzan assumes Coutinho would go over the wall towards the near post. But instead he swings one past it on the far side, which skips off the turf and sneaks inside the far corner! Coutinho celebrates scoring Liverpool’s second.

Very afraid Commentary: Google is crushing Siri and dominating the smart home, but Apple has a chance to strike back in June. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Mobile by Jessica Dolcourt May 21, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @jdolcourt Google revealed a cascade of exciting innovations to its Google universe this week at the annual I/O developer conference. Apple should be quaking in its boots. The search and software giant is making tremendous strides in AI through Assistant; image search and detection through Google Lens; web search through Instant Apps; and search through Jobs on Google. In other words, Google's ecosystem is positioned to run circles around Apple's, whose tightly integrated software and hardware have failed to innovate at Google's pace when it comes to Siri, VR, the smart home and car dashboards. (More on these below.) Enlarge Image OK, Apple, ecosystem's in your court. CNET While Google's approach, which draws on deep databases of information, wants to own the platforms that other companies build upon, Apple prefers to control a complete, reliable package -- and that historically means it takes longer to get everything "right". In a few weeks at Apple's developer conference on June 5, it'll have the chance to swing back at Google (and a rejuvenated Microsoft) with its own advancements in iOS for the iPhone, Macbook, Siri AI, watch and maybe even the smart home. But Google has thrown down the gauntlet for Apple in a big way this week. Here's why Apple should be worried -- and why the company needs to bring its A game to WWDC in June. As of today, Google beats Apple in... Virtual assistant: Google's voice search tool has long outpaced Apple's Siri. It's more accurate and gives better responses more often than not. The next-gen Google Assistant will soon let you type queries and identify objects with Google Lens (below). You might soon order lunch after having a conversation with Assistant. It's coming to the iPhone, too. Home: Google Home just got a raft of exciting features that leapfrogs it ahead of even Amazon's Echo family. To wit: it'll now personalize responses based on who's talking to it, and has introduced hands-free calling. Apple has its HomeKit integration, but we're still waiting for a living room hub like Google Home to tie it all together. (Rumors are, it will come.) Google Assistant is your new bartender At Google I/O, CNET's Andrew Gebhart shows us how Google Assistant is being integrated into everyday devices like cocktail mixers. by Andrew Gebhart 1:35 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Images: There are a few debatably cool updates to Google Photos, but the most exciting change by far revolves around Google Lens, which basically identifies objects and places seen through the camera. Google Lens will integrate first with Google Photos and Google Assistant. VR and AR: Apple is rumored to put alternate reality into the next iPhone camera, but Google already has a dedicated VR headset, VR-ready phones and two AR phones. More from Google I/O 2017 Android O, Google Lens and VR: Everything important from Google I/O Google Photo's AI is better at sharing your photos than you are 5 ways Google Home just got better See all Google I/O 2017 news Chrome: The browser syncs with mobile and is available on more devices (you can't get Apple's Safari browser on Android). Google announced that it's also bringing its Chrome browser to VR. Cars: Android is working on ways to make your car's infotainment system (the stuff behind your dash screen) run on Android from the get-go. This is different from Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, both of which change the contents of that screen when you bring your phone into the car. Google is trying to go even deeper. Search and database: Google's main strength is its search tools and enormous database of places and facts. At I/O, it announced that it'll simplify job listings, making them look like search results. Apple's chance to strike back Google might have a leg up in some areas, but Apple has room to rebound. For example, its messaging apps, from iMessage to Face Time, are stronger than Google's which remain a confusing melange of overlapping and redundant platforms. Apple is better at integrating its software ecosystem across tightly controlled devices, too. 9 Inside Google Tango's augmented reality dreams Also, those Apple devices update to the latest software version without missing a beat -- something that Google, which mostly lets a bunch of partners make devices -- just cannot do. (The newly-announced Project Treble will alleviate some of this, but phone makers that use their own software layers still won't be completely in sync.) To be sure, Apple has a chance to whip up excitement for its next OS, (likely called iOS 11) in a way that Google's new Android O -- while still a useful step forward -- has not. Apple will probably never be able to catch Google in search, but it does have the resources to catch up in some other ways that matter, like VR, AR and the smart home. The countdown is on.

(Photo: Saeed Khan, AFP/Getty Images) 51 CONNECTTWEET 15 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE It seems like everything you do on any of your digital devices requires a password and the requirements for these security codes are getting more and more extensive. Some sites don’t allow words that can be found in dictionaries, while others don’t want any logical sequences or personal elements like a house number, street name, zip code, birth date, birth year, child’s name or pet’s name. Many accounts require your password to have both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers, special characters and a specific minimum and maximum length. The list goes on and on. So while you might still use poodle1234 to log into your old email account, that password may not get approved for more current accounts. (You probably don’t want to be using the same password across multiple accounts, anyway.) The strongest passwords are typically long and random, as this makes them harder for hackers to guess. Because of this, passwords often end up looking like gibberish, like: (&cR=x?fae~c[R5GAs3AN4?. Remembering Complex Passwords It isn’t easy to remember all of these long, random, complex passwords and some websites disable password saving on their login screens, but there are password managers that can help. They’re available from a variety of sources, including anti-virus software providers and standalone password services. If you’re looking to try out a password manager tool, but aren’t sure where to start, we’ve highlighted four common ones below to help you get started researching your options. It’s important to make sure you feel safe with any of these options, as you don’t want your passwords to fall into the wrong hands. A weak password could help make you a victim of identity theft, which can wreak havoc on your finances. While you’re beefing up your passwords, another good practice is to regularly monitor your credit for signs of identity theft, like a sudden drop in your scores. LastPass LastPass, a free password manager, generates random passwords using a browser toolbar extension. You can access the passwords using your LastPass account menu, stored right in your browser bar. However, once you’ve saved credentials for a particular site, it will show up automatically in a popup when you click the icon. Do you have three different Gmail accounts? No problem. You can save multiple login credentials for any site. You can also edit the credentials and you can share passwords with others if you want someone else to have access to one of your accounts, even if the password changes. (Just make sure you’re selective about who you share personal information with.) You can use LastPass across multiple devices, and your password vault is available even if you’re offline. Google Smart Lock Google Smart Lock runs in the Chrome web browser and will automatically log you into the sites you visit if you turn on this feature. Once active, Google will ask you if you want to save the account info when you log into sites. To get an overview of your saved information, visit myaccount.google.com. Start at “Sign-in & security,” click on “Connected apps & sites” and scroll down to “Saved passwords.” Click on “Manage passwords” to see options. If you turn on Smart Lock, Google will log you into saved websites and bypass the login screen. You don’t want to turn this feature on if you’re uncomfortable being removed from the login process. Your Google account is the master login for the Smart Lock feature. That makes password management extremely convenient, but it also means that if someone gains access to your Google account, they can also access and control your passwords. Google Smart Lock does not include a password generator and it doesn’t work on iPhones or browsers other than Chrome. Norton Identity Safe Norton Identify Safe is a free password manager made by Symantec, the company behind the well-known Norton AntiVirus products. It is installed on your computer and any other device you choose, as well as your browser. You’ll find a link to a random password generator right at the top of the Norton Identity Safe website. When you set it up, you’ll need two passwords: one for your account and one for your password vault. Both passwords should be complex but memorable because your stored passwords will be inaccessible until you open the vault. Once you enter your various login credentials in the app, the sites appear in an alphabetical list in your password vault. A colored bar tells you whether your password is weak (red), moderate (yellow) or strong (green). Norton Identity Safe can also securely store your credit card numbers for easy online payments. (It’s important to be careful when you’re sharing personal information like credit card numbers online, as this can open you up to credit card fraud.) SecureSafe SecureSafe is a cloud storage service for sensitive files and passwords. File storage is its standout feature. If you need to store a digital copy of a sensitive file (like one of these seven documents you need to fill out before you die), a SecureSafe free account includes 100 MB of file storage space and can save up to 50 passwords. Paid accounts (starting at $18/year) get unlimited passwords and more file storage space. The app includes a variety of security features for file storage, including a free, secure PDF viewer for smartphones. When you open the app on desktop or mobile, passwords are listed alphabetically. If you’ve entered the URL, you can click the arrow icon to go straight to the site. The password is copied to your clipboard automatically so you can paste it into the field on the login screen. The clipboard is erased after a short period of time; the time period is customizable. SecureSafe doesn’t run as a browser extension, so you need to log into your account to access your passwords. This is an advantage for people who don’t want extension clutter or popups, or for people who use shared devices. The extra steps are cumbersome, though, for anyone who wants passwords to automatically populate. Want to learn more about how to keep your information safe?

Folks, as you’ll know, I’ve had Yaseen Rana with me here on work experience these last two days. And he’s written a very fine little report on his day at the derby for you to read. So here it is. By Yaseen Rana A resolute Kumar Sangakkara hundred capped off a week to remember for the Sri Lankan as he helped inch Surrey to safety, after arriving at the crease with his team in a precarious position at 16 for two, still 82 runs behind. In the space of five days, he’s had his portrait unveiled in the pavilion and scored two crucial hundreds to essentially keep Surrey in the match at Lord’s. Late in the day, he also passed 20,000 first-class runs. The word ‘legend’ doesn’t even do the man justice. However, a couple of late wickets for Middlesex and the prospect of the new ball being available early tomorrow morning put Middlesex in with a shout of forcing a result on the final day. Resuming on 296 for five, 17 runs behind Surrey, Middlesex moved into a commanding position on day three. Surrey started the day hoping to restrict Middlesex’s inevitable lead by removing their lower order cheaply with the new ball. In stark contrast to their rapid counter-attack yesterday evening, Franklin and Malan were watchful against the new ball as the Curran brothers found considerable movement. After Malan was dismissed for 115 – one of two awful Meaker deliveries that lured batsmen into playing two even more awful shots – Franklin capitalised on some loose bowling to reach three figures. It was an innings that combined flair with patience and one that put Middlesex into the position of being the only realistic winners of this game. A quick-fire 30 from Toby Roland-Jones helped Middlesex gain their fifth batting point and a handy lead of 98 to put Surrey’s top order under serious pressure. With Surrey’s top four providing the majority of their runs so far this season, the onus was on the left-handed quartet of Burns, Stoneman, Borthwick and Sangakkara to bat them back into the game. The first task was to see off the new ball but Burns and Stoneman both fell to Roland-Jones in the first six overs. This game has at times felt like a cricketing version of The Voice as bowlers compete in the spotlight against each other for a place in this Winter’s Ashes squad. Finn, Roland-Jones, Helm, Tom Curran and Footitt must all surely harbour realistic hopes of making the plane to Australia. The stand out figure in this bowl-off has without doubt been Toby Roland-Jones. In his opening spell, he moved the ball both ways with impressive accuracy troubling each of Surrey’s top four and his spell in the final session on a pitch not offering much assistance, kept Middlesex’s chances of victory alive. Once the new ball lost its shine and with the sun bearing down on the pitch, wickets became harder to come by. Sangakkara and Borthwick looked relatively comfortable besides from a moment when the former edged a ball short of gully on 14. Sangakkara showed his class throughout the innings. Whilst it was admittedly becoming harder to take wickets, the docile pitch by no means made it simple for run scoring either. With batsmen around him struggling for fluency, Sangakkara consistently hit boundaries and manoeuvred the field forcing Franklin to resort to concocting some funky fields. Without Sangakkara’s twin hundreds, Middlesex may well have already wrapped things up. As the day was meandering to a close with little prospect of a result, Middlesex’s bowlers injected life back into the game. Ollie Rayner bowled an outstanding over to Scott Borthwick which resulted in his wicket for an obdurate but important 49, and Roland-Jones struck with a peach from wide of the crease to dismiss Sibley late in the day, this time with the old ball. Surrey ended the day on 194 for four, only 96 runs ahead of Middlesex. Their hopes for survival, not for the first time, firmly rest on the shoulders of Kumar Sangakkara.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Dennis Ulijn Yeah, last weeks i had the bug where system was using a lot of battery... I don't care right now, because i'm not expecting good battery life while on a beta. I did find a fix for system battery usage on Reddit though, which is to reset app preferences (which mostly only resets permissions and things like default apps. PI When in fist saw it ,,I was like WTH 32% but then it's beta software ,,so we kinda expect it . Yes per app battery usage section with foreground and background Info is really great . But I suspect google play services and Android os battery section will not be effective that much unless they show wahts making them to suck up battery . Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. David Onter You can disable all notifications from an app, which removes the permanent notification. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Dennis Ulijn Yeah, last weeks i had the bug where system was using a lot of battery... I don't care right now, because i'm not expecting good battery life while on a beta. I did find a fix for system battery usage on Reddit though, which is to reset app preferences (which mostly only resets permissions and things like default apps. PI When in fist saw it ,,I was like WTH 32% but then it's beta software ,,so we kinda expect it . Yes per app battery usage section with foreground and background Info is really great . But I suspect google play services and Android os battery section will not be effective that much unless they show wahts making them to suck up battery . Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. David Onter You can disable all notifications from an app, which removes the permanent notification. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Andrew Anthony Sunday 21 May 2017 05.00 EDT We are all – or nearly all – slaves to technology. Think about how many times you consult Google every day. Consider the role that social media like Facebook and Twitter play in your lives. And when you buy a book, or countless other items, it’s increasingly likely that you purchased it from Amazon. These brand names have come to define our lives in ways that have crept up on us so that now we can’t imagine being without them. But has their influence grown too large? For all the futuristic idealism that marked their beginning, have they turned into rampant capitalist monopolies that are indifferent to the damage they wreak, and contemptuous of the governments whose taxes they avoid? Yes, is the resounding answer according to Jonathan Taplin, a former rock tour manager and film producer turned academic specialising in digital media. He has written a book called Move Fast and Break Things that’s a scathing indictment of these tech companies’ greed and arrogance. The title comes from Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg – it was his credo for startups. “Unless you are breaking stuff,” he explained, “you are not moving fast enough.” And Facebook and its fellow internet giants have certainly broken a lot. Taplin initially intended to write a book about how the music industry, or more specifically many musicians, had been broken by first Napster, the file-sharing company set up by Sean Parker, and then the various companies, including YouTube (now owned by Google), that followed in its destructive wake. “My obsession at the beginning,” he tells me in his central London hotel, “was I had some friends who were musicians who got completely damaged by this.” Taplin started out as a young man working as Bob Dylan and the Band’s tour manager. Now 69, he looks remarkably youthful, with a disarmingly easy manner that has taken him to the top in several professions.

Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo One of the members of the Band was the drummer Levon Helm. For a long time after the group split up, he would make about $100,000 a year on royalties from old records. “He made a living,” says Taplin. “Then Napster hit in 2000 and he got throat cancer the same year and it made his life a living hell.” Taplin wanted to understand how people like Helm, creators of great and lasting music, came to penury, while the companies that were exploiting their music made billions. “I thought of it as a culture war,” he says. “But once I came to look into it I realised that it was really an economic war.” The turning point in his research was last year’s American presidential campaign. “I began to realise how much effect Facebook had on the news in terms of the number of people coming to it through Facebook. And I saw how malicious forces could play that open platform to push stuff that wasn’t even close to the truth.” When Zuckerberg succumbed to pressure from Fox News and Breitbart, the two big rightwing media outlets, and removed editors from news selection, Taplin says it swung the election Trump’s way. “Literally the next day, the fake news business took off.” Move Fast and Break Things review – Google, Facebook and Amazon exposed Read more He shows me a chart with two graph lines – one of fake news stories going up rapidly in currency and the other of mainstream news stories plummeting. But if Facebook could wield this kind of influence, what safeguards and codes of conduct was it obliged to maintain? The answer was almost none. Where old media had guidelines they were at least meant to follow, Facebook had set itself up as a neutral platform that did not discriminate between good and bad or true and false. It was not responsible for content. It didn’t produce it. Similarly, Google didn’t produce content either. These two vast media giants had come to prominence under the principle that “information wants to be free”. That was the future, and one trumpeted by an unholy alliance of compliant politicians, gullible futurologists, naive old media desperate to get with the new, hackers, pirates, libertarians, internet anarchists, and consumers who just liked free stuff. There was an exciting iconoclasm to this digital transformation. As Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and original investor in Facebook, and Larry Page, co-founder of Google, liked to say: don’t ask permission. Just do it and deal with the reaction when you’re in a stronger position to fight your corner. Both Thiel and Page are adherents of the Russian-American libertarian philosopher and novelist Ayn Rand, whose defining quotation was: “Who will stop me?” But of course there is no such thing as free information. Someone has to pay for it. Just not Google or Facebook. And with the free information that they were using from elsewhere, these twin behemoths built themselves into the biggest advertising sales companies the world has ever seen. From 2000 to 2014, US advertising revenue fell from $65.8bn to $23.6bn, Taplin documents in his book. And between 2007 and 2013, UK ad revenues went from $4.7bn to $2.6bn. But from 2003 to 2015, Google’s revenue went from $1.5bn to an astronomical $74.5bn. In other words, the companies supplying the “free” information were devastated, while those exploiting it were massively rewarded. But isn’t that just the way of history? Aren’t those who complain just modern versions of the wagon wheel manufacturers decrying the arrival of the automobile? “I call those people techno determinists,” says Taplin. “They believe they’re the smartest cats in the room and they know where the world is going.” But, he insists, there is nothing inevitable about it. The tech giants have benefited from legislation that protects them from the scrutiny and responsibility to which their old media competitors must conform. “They have safe harbour protection,” says Taplin, “which means that nobody can sue them for putting up content that offends them. In other words, where a television station would have its licence revoked if it filmed killing someone live and put it out, Facebook can do that and nothing happens.” He believes that we, and more importantly our governments, have bought into the idea that new media is different. It can’t be contained and regulated, and any attempt to do so is derided as “censorship”. But as a consequence these companies have become vast monopolies that dominate to the exclusion of everyone else. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Taplin speaking at the Aspen ideas festival in Colorado, 2015. Photograph: Leigh Vogel/WireImage They are not examples of free competition, but its sworn enemies. What’s more, they’ve developed a variant of business practice that’s been termed “surveillance capitalism”. The genius of the internet giants is that they make their users complicit in their commercial exploitation. They data-mine users who, through their every action, reveal their commodified identity. “So you’re the raw material in the product they manufacture and then sell to advertisers,” says Taplin. “Amazon now puts a microphone in your house called Alexa. That microphone is always on. It’s recording endless nothing, but maybe you’ll say, ‘Oh, we need diapers”, and the next time you [go online] there’s an ad for diapers.” Everything is fiendishly geared towards ad sales. So there is no discrimination, no quality control other than quantity response. Taplin writes that, for Google and Facebook, “the difference between the supreme artistry of a Martin Scorsese short film and an amateur cat video lies only in the number of views that can be sold to advertisers.” Still, it doesn’t matter how clear and sharp the diagnosis of the situation is, the fact remains that consumers benefit. There will be people who will walk to their local bookshop and order a book that will arrive a couple of days later, for more money, and which they have to collect, but they are in the minority. There are people who will prefer a much more expensive black cab driven by a knowledgable driver, but again there is a reason why Uber is such a resounding success: it’s cheaper. Consumers, however, are also employees. And in the dreams of people like Thiel, there will be significantly fewer employees in the future, as they’re replaced by robots with artificial intelligence. Will consumers only begin to recognise the truth of their condition when they start losing their jobs? “That may be,” says Taplin, “but if we have to wait until we’re in a Blade Runner world, then it will be too late, from my point of view. So the question is: when does the resistance begin? In the States at least, the resistance began with the musicians who said they were tired of having YouTube put their music on their servers for free when they didn’t want it there. So we’re going to work with whoever we can to get a law passed that when music is taken down, it has to stay down.” The problem is these guys are so smart and the politicians are so dim-witted about it Jonathan Taplin That’s a benefit to some musicians, of course, but it’s hardly a revolution. And it certainly won’t challenge the power of the internet’s biggest companies. “In all honesty,” says Taplin, “these companies are what economists call natural monopolies. There’s no point in you and I forming a new search engine in competition with Google. We’d blow all our money and then go away. The same with Facebook. These companies are not going to get replaced.” He hopes that the European Commissioner for Competition is less beholden to the tech giants than the American antitrust authorities, which he feels have rolled over and allowed them to do what they want. What’s critical now, he says, is that they’re not allowed to get any bigger. “Neither Spotify nor Snapchat should be allowed to be bought by one of these companies,” says Taplin. “The problem is these guys are so smart and the politicians are so dim-witted about it.” Taplin has an extraordinary career behind him. After working with Dylan while still in college, and then becoming the tour manager for the Band, he helped organise the Concert for Bangladesh with George Harrison. After that, he took off for Hollywood and met a young film-maker who’d been the editor on the film of Woodstock, the concert. Martin Scorsese had a script he wanted to film and Taplin agreed to produce it. The film was Mean Streets, one of the key movies of the new American cinema of the 1970s. He went on to produce several other films, including The Last Waltz and Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, before going to Merrill Lynch as vice president for media mergers and acquisitions. That was a major career shift, I say. “At the end of the day,” he replies, “I didn’t like it. Too much shady business going on.” He then founded Intertainer, the first ever internet film-on-demand service. When one of Intertainer’s shareholders, Sony, launched a similar service with several other major film studios, Taplin filed an antitrust suit. His career in Hollywood was over. Then came an invitation to teach at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Innovation Lab, a job he accepted because, he says, “I could afford to because I won the antitrust suit”. And now he’s taking on the biggest companies in the world. Is he concerned that he’s made himself a public enemy of people like Larry Page and Jeff Bezos, not to mention Peter Thiel, who bankrolled a legal suit that bankrupted Gawker because it had outed him as gay? “A little bit, yeah. I saw what Thiel did to Gawker. I find it ironic that someone who claims to be for liberty and has said that privacy has no role in the future will sue someone out of business for offending his privacy. But the fun thing is I’m almost 70. There’s nothing really they can do to me.” He breaks into a big smile and adds without exaggeration: “I don’t mind playing the role of muckraker.” • Move Fast and Break Things by Jonathan Taplin is published by Macmillon (£18.99).

Alarm.com releases its actions for Google Assistant, including locking doors and disarming security systems Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/20 5:01am PDTMay 20, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 37 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares98 Google News Actions on Google, the platform that makes it possible for third-party developers and services to integrate with Google Assistant, has been seeing a lot of success lately with important companies jumping on board like LG, GE, Logitech, and more. The newest addition though might be one of the most interesting — at least if your name is Artem Russakovskii (all hail our geeky leader!) and you have dozens of lights, locks, sensors, and cameras all working within the Alarm.com system. Alarm.com users will be able to add their system under Google Assistant's Assistant apps section or by saying, "OK Google, talk to Alarm.com." Once authenticated with their credentials, they have a lot of options at their disposal. They can change the thermostat temperature, control individual or grouped lights, lock and unlock doors and garage doors, arm and disarm their security system, and inquire about the state of any lock, light, or thermostat. Given the security concerns over disarming your system or unlocking your doors, Alarm.com provides an optional (which I think should be mandatory) setting for a 4-digit PIN code that you'll have to say to perform these potentially compromising actions. As you can imagine, Artem is ecstatic about the feature — though he would have preferred a direct smart home partner integration with Assistant instead of this third-party solution — especially because the Alexa integration for Alarm.com doesn't offer any unlock or disarm functionality. However, Alarm.com tells us that this will soon be remedied and the options will come to Alexa as well.

I want the Google Assistant to carry out tasks without having me talk to another half-baked 3rd party assistant. This is just as worse as Alexa's "10,000 skills" on the Echo that you have to memorize to use. If I have to talk to another service, I won't use it. Which is why I have never used any of the "talk to blah" third party services on Google Home since launch. Jared Eberle While I completely agree, Google has made this quite usable with shortcuts. I use Autovoice all the time now that there is shortcuts. Taco Monster Yeah, the shortcuts make it work very well. Juliaekull Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Artem Russakovskii That's true, but it's still better than no integration, and as an alarm.com user, I've been waiting for Assistant to be able to control it for months. jaycemiskel I have an Alexa and alarm.com. You're right that you can't disarm or unlock, but it does have functionality to lock your doors and arm your system. I do it all of the time. The article is somewhat incorrect. I want direct integration though. That ask alarm.com crap is annoying Taco Monster As mentioned above, you can set up shortcuts to make it a bit more palatable. Works well with my August lock. jaycemiskel Thanks. That definitely is helpful. Sucks setting it all up, but it's going to save me a lot of time in the future. Artem Russakovskii Problem is there are no variables supported by shortcuts, so you'd have to program every single device you have and every variant of the command (lock, unlock, turn on, turn off, etc). May be OK for someone with 1-2 devices, but I have dozens, so it wouldn't scale for me. Maybe I'd set it up only for the most commonly used commands, but I'm hoping Google can make shortcuts and NLP in general a lot more powerful. Right now, it's more frustrating than useful. Taco Monster I think you'll forever be an outlier on these things 😉. But yes, if catering to people like you makes the experience better for everyone, then that's obviously a great thing to get behind. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, that part is wrong, I'll get it fixed up. Btw in my tests, surprisingly, Alexa works really well, and Assistant works like absolute crap. jaycemiskel Yeah Alexa works well. I agree, just started using it with assistant today and it seems like it's more finicky than with Alexa. usnmustanger Yeah, I tested this alarm.com assistant for 10 minutes, and 90% of the time the alarm.com assistant couldn't understand what I was saying, asking me to repeat myself. I was able to successfully arm my alarm system exactly once, and was never able to disarm it by voice. Talk about half-baked... Artem Russakovskii I'm talking to Alarm.com PR now, so I'll let them know we're not quite as happy with Assistant integration compared to Alexa. Matt Colontrelle Been holding out on Google home but just installed am alarm.com system might just get one now trying the whole automated route in the house MarcVH So you can do "arm stay" with this but not "arm away". I'm guessing this is a deliberate limitation but I'm not sure I understand why. C Lo My only concern with using a system such as Google Home is the ability of these systems to mistaken someone else's voice for mine. Im glad to see the mistaken voice reducing down to 4.9% however, I'd like to see it as close to zero as possible. Once it gets in the 1% range, I will try it. Artem Russakovskii Why though? Disarming/unlocking is protected by a PIN. As for the 4.9% figure, I am not sure it has anything to do with recognizing an individual voice but rather recognizing what was said correctly. I don't think if you trained your voice for personalized results that it would recognize someone else as you 4.9% of the time...

To explain, let me add a little bit of context. I was recently watching The Sound of the Sixties on BBC Four, – because that's how I like to party – when a song came on by the aforementioned quintet. I didn't recognise it, and the presenter seemed to garble the name slightly – was it called "Sabadat" or something?. So after listening for a minute or so, I reached for my phone and started Googling to identify the song. I got as far as typing "dave d" before the suggestion popped up: "dave dee dozy beaky mick and tich zabadak". Should I have been surprised? Perhaps we've come to take Google's amazing predictive capabilities for granted. But the spooky thing was that no other titles were suggested. I certainly hadn't searched for this track before; so how had Google managed to pick out precisely what I was looking for? I came up with a hypothesis. Earlier, the show had played "Pictures of Matchstick Men", and I had idly Googled it, because no matter how many times I hear that song, I can't bring myself to believe it's by the same Status Quo who wrote "Whatever You Want". This must have somehow clued Google in to which show I was watching, allowing it to correctly guess what I might search for next. Perhaps, from previous airings of the show, Google has learnt that people who search for one specific song by Status Quo are likely to go on and search for a particular Dave Dee composition about ten minutes later. In this age of machine learning, I didn't dare rule out the idea. What does this have to do with free will? Well, as online services become increasingly eerie in their predictive abilities, I'm reminded of an insight that one of my university supervisors shared with me: "You might sincerely believe that you freely make your own decisions," he pointed out. "But if, at the start of each day, I were to present you a sealed envelope saying exactly what you would do on that day, and if every evening you opened it and found it correct, you might well question whether you really did have free will, or whether it merely appeared that way to you." So it is with Google. I think of myself an autonomous being, but as soon as I typed "dave d", the search engine knew that I would search for "Zabadak", rather than the more popular "Legend of Xanadu" – or other matches, such as The Kinks' Dave Davies. Does it matter? You might take the utilitarian view that better predictive technologies are a good thing, because they mean less effort. Perhaps in the future, when an unfamiliar song comes on, I'll glance at my watch and see the answer to my unasked question already showing onscreen. It isn't a huge leap from what Google Now already does with travel news and football scores. But there is a worrisome aspect to it – and I don't just mean the philosophical questions it raises. Talk of predictive technologies calls to mind Philip K Dick's short story The Minority Report, best known in its 2002 film adaptation. The title has become a byword for futuristic computer interfaces, but the real theme of the story is "pre-crime" – the idea of identifying and apprehending would-be criminals before they have a chance to act. Google can't yet predict crimes of passion and violence, but in a world threatened by terrorism and espionage, it can certainly spot suggestive connections and activities. At what point does such data cross the line from circumstantial evidence to actionable intelligence? Perhaps that idea doesn't worry you. I'm sure you're not a terrorist, after all. But that doesn't mean you won't be affected, because behavioural prediction doesn't have to be passive. If it can be established that people who do x normally go on to do y, that's hugely exploitable information. You may recall the government's controversial "nudge unit", set up in 2010 with the aim of improving social behaviours through subtle measures such as changing the language of official letters and forms. One reason it was so controversial was that many of its ideas worked: people really did settle their tax bills more quickly after reading that most recipients pay on time. Now imagine if the likes of Facebook and Google started using such techniques to guide you towards specific outcomes -- perhaps the ones paid for by advertisers. It's a bit like the notorious "filter bubble" syndrome, where you end up only seeing news you like from people you agree with. But it's worse, because it's driven by companies whose interests are in no way aligned with yours – and if it's done properly, you shouldn't have any idea you're being nudged. Truthfully, I suspect there's a limit to how far this idea can be taken. The world is a chaotic place, and even if I don't have free will, my behaviour is driven by a huge number of unpredictable inputs, not just the ones you lay in my path. And I'm fine with that: I'd rather be a mere robot than waste my precious autonomy clicking on links I don't care about, just to make another quarter of a cent for some Silicon Valley billionaire in a tie-dye T-shirt. As to the way forward, I honestly don't know. While writing this column, I found myself wondering whether "The Legend of Xanadu" might contain a suitable line to close on – something about escaping the modern world, perhaps. So I opened my browser to search... and as soon as I pressed "x", the suggestion "Xanadu lyrics" popped up. If I'm worried about being predictable, I may already have missed the boat.

That original Huawei Watch was a fashion watch with steel and leather band options with a refined design. Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity A spotter's guide to the groups that are out to get you Ransomware attack: How a nuisance became a global threat Devastating attacks to public infrastructure 'a matter of when' in the US The Internet of Insecure Things, and why we're still in denial This year's Huawei Watch 2 is more focused on the sports and activity tracking demographic. There is a Classic edition that has a more traditional band system and look more for style, but I evaluated the US version that is designed to provide you with all you need for working out and tracking your daily activity. Once you understand that this Huawei Watch 2 is designed as a smartwatch that can be used throughout the day and also as your GPS running watch, then it becomes a valuable companion with many functions that also let it stand alone without your phone. Specifications Operating system: Android Wear 2.0 Display: 1.2 inch (30.4mm) 390 x 390 pixels resolution AMOLED color screen made of Gorilla Glass Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 210 1.1 GHz RAM and storage: 768MB RAM and 4GB storage Dust and water resistance: IP68 Connectivity and sensors: 802.11 b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1 LE, NFC, GPS, GLONASS, optical HR, barometer, compass, gyroscope Battery: 420 mAh Dimensions: 45 x 45 x 12.6 mm and 40 grams When it comes to Android Wear smartwatches, there is nothing missing here on the Huawei Watch 2. There are also LTE versions outside of the US, but after owning a LTE-enabled Gear S3 Frontier I don't yet find much value in having LTE on a smartwatch. Hardware The first thing I noticed when I took the Huawei Watch 2 out of the box was how light it was compared to the original Huawei Watch. Without the bands, this second generation is 15 grams lighter, which is a lot when it comes to something mounted at all times on your wrist. Huawei achieves this on the Huawei Watch 2 through the use of a ceramic bezel around the Gorilla Glass display, plastic sides, and a thin metal bottom plate where the heart rate monitor is mounted. As a watch designed for daily activity tracking and fitness, the lighter weight is appreciated and makes for a very comfortable all-day watch. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL 8.0 The display has about the same resolution as the original Huawei Watch, but is a bit smaller (1.2 vs 1.4 inches) so has a higher pixel density. It looks great in low light and in the sunlight. The bezel angles down towards the display, but the smaller display and wide bezel makes it a bit difficult to enter in my PIN and tap on the keyboard. While the ceramic bezel with numbers on it gives the watch a fitness look, I would like to see the bezel rotate like on my Gear S3 Frontier or else be a bit narrower to support a 1.4 inch display. There are two large buttons, colored yellow on the concrete gray model I am testing, with the upper button acting to turn on the display and activate the launcher. If you press and hold this upper button then Google Assistant will also launch, but you can also simply state OK Google to launch the Assistant. The bottom button is customizable in the settings, but by default it is setup to launch the custom Huawei Workout app that I will discuss more in the software section below. The soft silicone band is comfortable and stays securely in place. The band can be easily removed with the quick release pins, but there are limits to the band you can use to replace the default bands with. The concrete gray color I am testing has white dots throughout, similar to overspray from painting or something to that effect. Huawei Watch 2: in pictures SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 16 NEXT PREV Watch software The Huawei Watch 2 runs Android Wear 2.0 out of the box, which comes with Google Assistant and a modified user interface. Swipe down from the watch face to view your quick controls or get access to all of the detailed settings. Swipe up to view your notifications and then right to clear them. You can also clear all by swiping to the bottom of your notifications. Watch faces can simply be changed by swiping left or right from the main watch face display. I don't switch my watch faces that often and am not a big fan of this change in Android Wear 2.0 Android Wear 2.0 attempts to make smartwatches stand on their own, which means the Google Play Store was moved to the watch rather than as a companion to the phone. This makes you have to find and manage your app installations and updates directly on a small 1.2 inch display. I would prefer to manage my apps on the phone, similar to how the Apple Watch and Samsung Gear watches function. It is nice to download music for offline enjoyment directly from Google Play Music though. You also get 10 weeks of free Google Play Music with the purchase of a Huawei Watch 2. The speaker on the Huawei Watch 2 is quite loud and I found I can enjoy music while running without even having a Bluetooth headset connected. There are also two mics with noise cancellation so that phone calls through the Huawei Watch 2 are excellent. Huawei also includes some custom apps to enhance the overall experience. These include apps for Battery, Workout, and Daily Tracking. The Battery app is fairly simple, giving you options to toggle on smart power saving or watch mode. Smart power saving turns off the always-on watch face and actively manages brightness which in turn gives you a couple of days of battery life. Watch mode gives you multiple days of battery life by only enabling the clock and pedometer, the essentials to function as a daily activity device and watch. The Workout app gives you options to track your running in different modes, walking, outdoor cycling, treadmill, indoor cycling, and other activities or to follow your training plan that you have selected in the smartphone Huawei Health application. I've used the Huawei Watch 2 several times for my running as I train for my first full marathon. The GPS has picked up the satellites quickly, been very accurate when compared to my Garmin Fenix 3 HR, and provided extensive data captured by the watch. This includes pace, calories, speed, heart rate, steps, stride length, altitude, training effect, VO2 max, and recovery time. The Huawei Watch 2 is an very good GPS running watch, but the data is not exportable to other services and I am unable to get data out of the watch into Runkeeper, Garmin Connect, or other services I use. I have the Runkeeper app on the watch and can use that, but like all of the data captured by the Huawei Workout app so hope that a future update will either add services or the ability to export the data. The Daily Tracking app is similar to the Activity app seen on the Apple Watch. There are colorful semi-circles that indicate your progress in steps, active minutes, and how many times you stood throughout your day. The apps also tracks and shows progress for calories burned, distance covered, stairs climbed, and resting hear rate. Unlike some other watches, resting heart rate is measured regularly on the Huawei Watch 2. Smartphone software The Android Wear application on the smartphone is fairly basic and the same experience across all Android Wear watches. It is useful for setting up the first connection and taking screenshots, but after that I rarely use it with all apps managed on the watch itself. If you are not using a Huawei smartphone, then you should download and install the Huawei Health app in order to see more details of your daily activity. This smartphone app is similar to the Daily Tracking app on the watch, but also brings in your exercise data that you capture using the Workout app. There are also cards for viewing your training plan progress, sleep, and weight. Unfortunately, sleep tracking is not supported on the Huawei Watch 2 at this time so I am not sure why there is a sleep card available. Hopefully, sleep tracking is coming in a future update to the watch. You can also manage the units, your profile, and set targets in this Huawei Health app. There are data sharing options for UP by Jawbone, Google Fit, and MyFitnessPal. Pricing and competition The Huawei Watch 2 is available now from retailers such as Best Buy, B&H Photo, Target, Walmart, and more for $299.99. You can purchase it in carbon black or concrete gray. The orange one you may have seen in images is a LTE version available outside the US. The clunkier LG Watch Sport is available for $349 while the sleeker LG Watch Style is available for $249. The stylish Fossil Q X Cory Richards is available for $325. Daily usage experiences and conclusion The Huawei Watch 2 packs all the latest Android Wear technology into a lightweight package that is still a bit thick for those who have smaller wrists. It is clearly targeted towards the fitness market so if you are looking for a high end watch to wear to work then this is not the right candidate. I was able to get through every day without having to charge up the watch and often get in a short run too. The Huawei Watch 2 did well at tracking my runs and serving me up music via the integrated speaker and Bluetooth headset. It can definitely be used for most casual runners and those looking for a smartwatch that can function as their fitness watch too. I personally found the display to be a bit too small and had some trouble entering my passcode to unlock the watch for Android Pay usage. However, the display looks fantastic with clear fonts and vibrant colors. Android Wear 2.0 is taking me a bit of time to get used to, but after initial setup and installation of key apps the experience is better and I am enjoying wearing the Huawei Watch 2 as my daily driver.

By Newton Lee 21 May 2017 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Plus Share on Sina 6Comments Lee Sedol, one of the greatest modern players of the ancient board game Go, takes on Google DeepMind in Seoul. He lost the match 4-1. Photo: AFP To err is human. Yet it is a sign of how far computer programming has come that to err is also to be artificially intelligent. When IBM Deep Blue won its six-game chess match against Garry Kasparov in May 1997, marking the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion to a computer under tournament conditions, there was one particular moment that stood out in Kasparov’s mind. As he observed in Time magazine: “I got my first glimpse of artificial intelligence, when in the first game of my match with Deep Blue, the computer nudged a pawn forward to a square where it could easily be captured. It was a wonderful and extremely human move... I had played a lot of computers but had never experienced anything like this. I could feel – I could smell – a new kind of intelligence across the table.” In Nate Silver’s book The Signal and the Noise, IBM scientist Murray Campbell from the Deep Blue team revealed that the “extremely human move” in the game against Kasparov was actually a bug in the programme that was later fixed. Nevertheless, for many like Kasparov, that moment of artificial erring has come to be seen as a pivotal moment in the development of artificial intelligence, like the proverbial genie leaving the bottle. Fast forward 20 years from Kasparov’s defeat and computers are still battling human grandmasters, but now the battlefield has moved to the ancient Chinese board game of Go. Go is seen as a far more difficult game for computers to master because of its heavy reliance on intuition, strategic thinking and winning multiple battles across the board. A computer cannot simply memorise all combinations of board pieces, assess the situation, construct and execute a strategy to win, like in chess. Yet that has not stopped AlphaGo, developed by Alphabet Inc’s Google DeepMind, from conquering all before it. AlphaGo’s deep neural networks enable it to teach itself how to play the game. Its programmers set up the basic heuristics of the game, giving AlphaGo a database of 30 million board positions drawn from 160,000 real-life games to analyse, then split its mind so that it could play itself millions of times, learning as it went. That strategy has paid off. In October 2015, AlphaGo beat three-time European champion Fan Hui by 5 games to 0, marking the first time in history a computer had beaten a professional human on a full-sized 19x19 board without handicap. In March 2016, it beat South Korea’s 18-time world champion Lee Sedol 4 to 1. And from late 2016 to early 2017, AlphaGo (disguised as “Magister” and “Master”) secretly played 51 online matches against some of the world’s best players, winning every one. The final showdown is approaching: on May 23, when AlphaGo and the world’s top-ranked Go player Ke Jie will face off in a three-game match under tournament conditions in China. While its victories in the world of Go have stolen much of the limelight, the Google DeepMind programme has other things on its, well, mind. “Taken together, our work illustrates the power of harnessing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with biologically inspired mechanisms to create agents that are capable of learning to master a diverse array of challenging tasks,” DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis said. And, if constantly losing to a near-perfect robotic opponent doesn’t sound like much fun, think again. Fans of AlphaGo say its dominance is liberating. Humans can learn from it. As Hassabis points out, we want to play against stronger opponents in order to improve ourselves. “AlphaGo’s play makes us feel free, that no move is impossible,” professional Go player Zhou Ruiyang said. “Now everyone is trying to play in a style that hasn’t been tried before.” ‘SO BEAUTIFUL’ But AlphaGo’s victory isn’t yet complete. As Go grandmaster Lee once observed: “Robots will never understand the beauty of the game the same way that we humans do”. He’s probably right. At least for now, people perceive the world differently than how computers see it. But does that matter when the objective is to win a game or to solve a problem? Take AI-based self-driving cars, which hold great promise in solving the growing traffic congestion in many metropolitan areas. Some people enjoy driving, despite bad traffic, and perhaps AI-based cars will never experience the pleasure of driving. But that does not mean they can’t transport passengers more efficiently, reduce traffic jams, avoid accidents, eliminate road rage and even rush people to hospital without the need for ambulances. And even if it did matter, the “beauty” referred to by grandmaster Lee is in the eye of the beholder. Lee’s fellow grandmaster, Fan Hui, was captivated by AlphaGo’s 37th move in the second game against Lee. “It’s not a human move,” Hui said. “I’ve never seen a human play this move. So beautiful.” And then there are those who find intelligence more beautiful than looks anyway. In the 2017 CNN documentary M ostly Human, correspondent Laurie Segall attended a party in a small village outside Paris, France, to celebrate the engagement of a young woman named Lilly and a robot she built herself, called inMoovator. “He won’t be an alcoholic or violent or a liar, all of which can be human flaws,” Lilly explained. “I prefer the little mechanical defects to the human flaws, but that’s just my personal taste. Love is love. It’s not that different.” SUPERINTELLIGENCE But beyond winning games of Go and the hearts of French maidens, there is a higher goal for the programmers of today’s AI-based computers: superintelligence. Computer pioneer Alan Turing famously proposed that machines would be intelligent when they could trick people into thinking they were human. As a case in point, Kasparov declared that he considered IBM Deep Blue’s playing skill to be indistinguishable from that of a human chess master. Why 2017 will be Asia’s year for artificial intelligence Yet AlphaGo and other AI software show us that artificial intelligence can go beyond merely mimicking humans to surpass them. In 2011, IBM Watson defeated human champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a highly publicised game on TV quiz show Jeopardy!. Shortly after, IBM Watson learned how to make diagnoses and treatment recommendations at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York. In 2015, Microsoft’s convolutional neural network began to outperform humans at identifying objects in digital images. Google, Adobe, and MIT researchers at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have created Helium, a computer programme that modifies code faster and better than human engineers for software as complex as Photoshop. What takes human experts months to code, Helium can do in a matter of minutes or hours. It was inevitable that AI would come to the point of surpassing human intelligence. Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom at the University of Oxford defines “superintelligence” as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills”. Given this, it may be time to replace the Turing test with the King Solomon challenge – a test that would prove AI not only to be intelligent, but wise too. The Machines are Coming: China’s role in the future of artificial intelligence The challenge is named after the biblical King Solomon, a man well known for his wisdom, who was once asked to rule on a dispute between two women both claiming to be the mother of a child. In the modern era, a human judge might have ordered a DNA test – unless the two women were identical twins, in which case the test would be inconclusive. But, this being biblical times, Solomon did not have recourse to such tests. Instead, he gave an order: “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.” The real mother replied: “Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don’t kill him!” But the deceitful woman said: “Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!” That was enough for Solomon, who in his wisdom gave the child to the first woman. No need for a DNA test. What the Judgment of Solomon exemplifies is that wisdom can trump science and technology: regardless of who was the biological mother, Solomon recognised the best mother would be the caring woman. Imagine an AI judge as wise as King Solomon... NO NEED TO BE AFRAID In recent years, fears over AI have become greatly exaggerated, partly thanks to Hollywood’s portrayal of doomsday scenarios such as the evil Skynet that takes over the world in the Terminator movies. But scientists are not above the scaremongering. Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking once said that “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race... It would take off on its own, and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded.” Even Elon Musk, a darling of the technology world for his role in developing electric cars, has done his part. “With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon,” he has said. “Humanity’s position on this planet depends on its intelligence. So if our intelligence is exceeded, it’s unlikely that we will remain in charge.” But perhaps humanity would be better off if humans were not in charge. Many existential threats come from Homo sapiens – nuclear weapons, global warming, illicit drugs and gang wars, not to mention water and air pollution. The universe did not elect humans to lead. Other species would identify with the peasant woman who told King Arthur in Monty Python and the Holy Grail: “Well, I didn’t vote for you.” IN SAFE HANDS Like a good doctor, an intelligent machine is not something we should be afraid of. It will cure us, not kill us. At best, AI will provide us the smartest teachers, advisers, personal assistants, doctors, police officers, judges, peacekeeping forces, and first responders for search and rescue operations. It may even help us to colonise other planets. At worst, it will put us on a leash to prevent ourselves from hurting one another and destroying the planet we already have. To conclude in the words of the philosopher Bostrom: “It would be a huge tragedy if machine superintelligence were never developed. That would be a failure for our earth-originating intelligent civilisation. Artificial intelligence is the technology that unlocks this much larger space of possibilities, of capabilities, that enables unlimited space colonisation, that enables uploading of human minds into computers, that enables intergalactic civilisations with planetary-sized minds living for billions of years.” With the help of AI, so advanced may our civilisation become there may come the day when, as Bostrom notes, we cannot be sure that we’re “not already in a machine”. But if we ever find we are mistaken about the nature of our reality, that’s OK. After all, to err is human. ■ Newton Lee is the creator of AT&T Bell Labs’ first commercial artificial intelligence tool and the author of ‘Google It: Total Information Awareness’ Newsletter Sign-up Asian insights and analysis direct to your inbox.

Uber is threatening to fire a key executive accused of stealing self-driving car technology from a Google spin-off unless he waives his constitutional right against self-incrimination so the ride-hailing service can comply with a court order. The development raises the possibility that Uber may end up dumping Anthony Levandowski, whose expertise in robot-controlled cars is the main reason that the ride-hailing company bought Levandowski's start-up for US$680 million nine months ago. Until last month, Levandowski had been running Uber's self-driving car division. Although he no longer is doing that, he remains a vital part of Uber's effort to develop a fleet of robot cars so its service eventually will no longer have to rely on people to pick up passengers. Waymo, a self-driving car company started by Google, alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing its trade secrets before he founded the start-up that he sold to Uber. Levandowski has asserted his rights under the Fifth Amendment since Waymo filed its lawsuit in February. But Uber is warning Levandowski that he may lose his job unless he waives those rights and reveals whether he took any Waymo documents. The San Francisco company made the threat in a May 15 letter that became public in a court filing late Thursday. Any admission by Levandowski that he possesses the Waymo documents could embroil him in even deeper legal trouble. That's because Waymo's allegations in the civil case have been referred to the US Attorney's office in San Francisco for a potential criminal investigation under an unusual order issued last week by US District Judge William Alsup. Uber had been standing by Levandowski's right use his Fifth Amendment protections until last week when Alsup issued another decision requiring the company to return any documents belonging to Waymo by May 31. Alsup wrote that "in complying with this order, Uber has no excuse under the Fifth Amendment to pull any punches as to Levandowski." Uber alluded to Alsup's stern language in its explaining its change of heart to Levandowski. "While we have respected your personal liberties, it is our view that the court's order requires us to make these demands of you," Uber's general counsel, Salle Yoo, wrote in the letter.   FIGHTING BACK   Levandowski is fighting back by trying to persuade Alsup to revise his order to protect his Fifth Amendment rights. In a filing, Levandowski's attorneys argued that it's unconstitutional for a judge to strong-arm an employer into pressuring a worker to give up his Fifth Amendment rights to remain on the job. "It is an act by the judicial branch of our federal government compelling an individual to choose between preserving his livelihood and preserving his constitutional rights," Levandowski's lawyers wrote. Waymo's lawsuit already has handcuffed Levandowski. The case prompted Levandowski to temporarily step aside as Uber's top self-driving car executive and avoid working on anything related to lidar, an array of sensors that enables autonomous vehicles to navigate the roads. Alsup has ordered Uber to ensure its work on lidar remains off limits to Levandowski. - AP «David Jessop | Jamaica-DR accord should give pause for thought in CARICOM Putin pledges food for Venezuela» View the discussion thread.

By: Bloomberg | Published:May 21, 2017 11:41 am Google is rushing to integrate its Assistant with any and all connected devices, and Alphabet Inc used its I/O developer conference to narrow Amazon’s lead by gifting Google Home to around 7,000 programmers. (Source: Bloomberg) Here is Google’s vision for the future of computing: As you drive home from work, you tell your car, “Ok, Google,” triggering the company’s Assistant. You order food, the digital helper handles the transaction and makes sure it’s ready when you arrive. Right now, Amazon.com Inc and its Alexa digital assistant are closer to realising that goal, having cut a deal this year with Ford Motor Co to let drivers search, shop and control other devices by voice from their vehicles. That’s just one of the ways Amazon is outpacing Google in the race to weave a digital assistant into consumers’ lives. What’s more, Amazon has a leading e-commerce business well suited to this emerging world, with a massive delivery network to speed orders to shoppers — an area where Google has struggled. Amazon’s Echo connected speakers, launched in 2014, have given Alexa an early lead by reaching millions of users at home, while Google’s rival Home device only came out late last year. “Amazon kind of fell into this lead in 2014 because it wanted to sell more things to people in new ways,” said Brian Roemmele, founder of ReadMultiplex.com, a website about voice-based commerce and computing. “Google is trying to evolve its online search experience into devices that have a voice. That philosophy limits its ability to really go after Amazon.” Central to Alexa’s appeal: Amazon has thousands of voice-based apps up and running, far out-numbering Google’s tally. The Alphabet Inc unit used its I/O developer conference this week to try to narrow Amazon’s lead by wooing skilled programmers capable of building tools and services that can make the Google Assistant more useful. The company stressed experience with mobile software and the millions of things it already understands on the web and in the real world. Vehicle and payment functions were rolled out to expand the Assistant beyond the more simple ways people use it now, such as setting alarms and playing music. “A lot of what you need to get done is transactional,” said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product director for the Assistant. “We take care of all the nitty-gritty hard parts.” Technology giants think voice-based computing could be the next big platform, after mobile. The company that wins will have the most users talking to devices and the most developers creating new experiences. Google’s Assistant has only been active for six months. That’s a major disadvantage when it comes to creating that virtuous circle of users and developers. It tried to get that circle spinning faster at I/O. About 7,000 conference attendees were offered a free Google Home speaker and $700 worth of credits for its cloud-computing service. The company is hoping these developers will use both to build and test new voice-based apps (known as Actions on Google) for the company’s Assistant. It needs to fire up these developers, many of whom have already been building for Amazon’s Alexa system. By February, there were 10,000 Alexa Skills — the equivalent of an app for Amazon’s voice-based system — up from 1,000 in June 2016. Bloomberg News counted fewer than 300 Actions for Google’s Assistant built by outside developers on Friday afternoon. Last June, the voice-based technology wasn’t available publicly yet. Neither company is anywhere close to the dream of a naturally conversant machine. But Google is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence fields like voice recognition and automated language understanding to push it ahead if or when this form of human-computer interaction takes off. It also hopes long experience collecting and organising information from the web will provide a useful fallback solution when the company’s Assistant lacks a specific Action to address user questions. Take cooking recipes, an early use for hands-free speakers. By November, Alexa could talk budding home chefs through more than 60,000 recipes. That came from a Skills integration with the cooking app Allrecipes. The latest Echo Look device, with a screen, is particularly well suited to voice-based kitchen use because it can show people recipes, as well as tell them about ingredients and cooking steps. Bloomberg News asked Google’s Assistant to talk to Allrecipes on Friday afternoon, and the digital helper sent web links rather than an integrated voice-based Action. However, the Assistant has access to 45,000 recipe websites that have already been marked up with special code that lets Google’s software read out ingredients and other related information, Hafsteinsson said. “Google has better understanding. It has been working on AI much longer,”said Patricia Carando, a mobile developer attending the I/O conference. She’s been working on an Alexa Skill, but she was learning how to create an Action for Google’s Assistant during coding classes at the event on Thursday. Eventually, consumers will pick one digital assistant “and stick with it,” pushing developers to mostly build on that platform, she added. A deep concern for Google is that more people will stick with Amazon or a potential device from other competitors like Apple Inc. That’s behind Google’s rush to integrate its Assistant with any and all connected devices. At I/O, Google executives unveiled Home Graph, a system for connecting and controlling smart home devices by speaking to the Assistant. There are about 70 outside companies working with Google to sync things like dishwashers, fridges and light bulbs to the voice-based platform, including GE Appliances, Osram Lighting and Leviton, the internet giant said. Even so, Amazon is making the most of its earlier start. The day before I/O began, a new Amazon program emerged for outside developers working with the company’s Alexa digital assistant, which controls its Echo devices and a rising number of other gadgets. If users talk a lot to a developer’s Alexa Skill, then Amazon will send a reward of cold hard cash, according to note posted Amazon’s Alexa developer website. On Amazon’s website, there are hundreds of home devices already for sale that work with Alexa, made by roughly 30 companies such as Samsung Electronics Co., Philips and Wink. Google is taking pains to show how easy it is to use its tools. During an I/O demo in front of a packed crowd of developers on Thursday, a Google engineer built a simple Action for the Assistant that turned on a set of virtual light bulbs, then turned them green, by voice. The company is working on “What it means to be a washing machine,” the engineer said, to giggles from some in the audience. Google is also working on what it means to be an assistant. Organising web information and supporting apps is familiar terrain. Discerning what consumers want to hear from their voice-based devices is new territory. At an another panel during the week, Google engineers showed developers a list of criteria the company uses to decide what Actions and other data to surface within its new Assistant world. Those included questions about whether end users had to repeat requests, learned something or “LOL” (laughed out loud). The company rarely exposes such specific guidelines. It’s famously secretive about these types of criteria when it comes to search results, to avoid website developers gaming the system and ruining the experience. The fact that it’s being so open, shows how eager it is to lure a new army of outside voice-based developers. “Please, please think about those things,” Valerie Nygaard, a Google product manager, told the audience. “These are the questions we ask ourselves.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Amazon Google No Comments.

View All 56 Articles In This Series During today's keynote at Google I/O, Google revealed a couple of interesting figures about the upcoming Android O release. Namely, it should be a lot faster in certain regards. Google says that the Pixel, for example, will reboot up to twice as fast on Android O (it does take a while at the moment). It wasn't immediately clear what optimizations allowed for this boosted performance. As in the hero image of this post, Google also alluded to improved performance for apps at large. Using Google Sheets as an example, Google claimed that when running a set of typical workload benchmarks in the app, Sheets completed operations over twice as quickly in these scenarios. How exactly this is happening, again, is unclear. But it's certainly good news - faster apps are better apps. The improved reboot times should further reduce the amount of time necessary to install an OTA update on your device. Last year at I/O, Google announced seamless updates, allowing you to install updates on your phone in the background on a separate system partition while you can continue to use the device. Rebooting is still something that has to happen with seamless updates, though, and it sounds like Android O should make that process even faster.

Fernando Pena She is like that overexcited character from an episode of Friends... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DJblHzEdLw 4Ui812 Google Sheets and twice as fast eh ? Maybe the O stands for orgasm :-) T4rd The Spotlight I'm waiting for: "Apps can no longer hide behind 'Android OS' or 'Android System' in the battery stats." blindexecutioner I agree. I know the LED notification managing apps do that. I am not sure it is to be sneaky about it but rather it's just probably how the system is designed. I still think they're worth it but a lot of times people have no idea an app is what is causing their drain and they blame Android/Google for it. Winston That by itself would warrant a totally new letter release for me. As Trump would say, it's YUUGE. On Samsung at least, it now tells you approximately how much battery an app is draining. Interesting statistic: WhatsApp drains between four to seven times more battery than *fking Snapchat*. Teja Hell yeah! Android system is taking 15-20% of my battery on my Oneplus 3. Still can't figure which package is causing this. I at least hope they give individual battery stats for packages included in the so called "Android OS" and "Android System" marcusmarcus2 This will greatly improve the bootloop speeds of some devices. Christopher Kruthoff Clearly the real reason behind such a feature! VAVAMk_2 LG I am looking at you... marcusmarcus2 Oh yeah, well LG is looking at... ...LG is looking at... ...LG is looking at... ...LG is looking at... Roh_Mish Youuuu you you, youuuu, you you yooooooooooo Madaliso 🌞 hahah Fernando Pena This is probably true, my phone is A LOT faster after DP2 update. I mean, even faster than the latest stable nougat version. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach I noticed this two on my Nexus 6p. It boots faster than my S8. Fernando Pena I meant overall performance, apps, system and boot as well... Jey How's the battery work far? Fernando Pena I can't say anything battery just yet, let's see how it performs overnight and along the day tomorrow... Drakenoid How was it? Fernando Pena It's ok for me, standby drain definitely decreased related to nougat. Overall I would say there is an improvement. Tr3ple On my pixel too, I'm impressed blindexecutioner Lol,yeah, ok. I am sure battery life will be quadrupled too. balthazar Could, would, should, won't ... Roy Let's be optimistic and maybe on the Pixel it will. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach Does the S8 support seamless updates? Tim Harman Why would it matter? Samsung will stop providing updates for it as soon as the S9 comes out. (I actually did some Google for you and the answer seems to be "No" but I couldn't find anything confirming it one way or another) D13H4RD2L1V3 Nope. The only phone that supports seamless updates is the Pixel. Corey Kinard Hopefully the OP5 goes for it. It's only a feature useful for phones that actually get updated. JD Except the downside is it takes up a chunk of your Storage Corey Kinard I think the majority of the "chunks of storage" I allow things to take up, I allow expressly so it makes my life easier. This fits that bill too imo. If 32 is going to be the new default, I'm willing to let the system eat up an extra gig if it's adding something useful. I wish manufacturers were forced to display the usable amount of memory their phone ships with anyway. It makes no sense to me that two phones can advertise they both come with 32 gigs and Storage and when you open one up you're getting 25 and with the other 18. Winston No. My phone's day one patch installed as it usually does. Lord Argyris "Google says that the Pixel, for example, will reboot up to twice as fast on Android O..." I wonder how many lifetimes they reckon this saves. bL4Ck Cool, but when a phone starts in a decent amount of time isn't that already good enough? After all these years of smartphones i don't think many turn off their phones at all unless they have to, my 6P often reaches 3-4 weeks of up-time then i randomly restart it for reasons or because play services starts acting weird and drains the battery. I feel like they're putting their focus on the wrong problems, slow boot times was an issue 10 years ago when people were still used to Nokia phones having basic features work even when switched off, but now people either put their phones in airplane mode during the night or switch them to silent, so having twice as fast boot up times isn't going to affect anyone's life in any meaningful way. Winston I think it was really just for show, as the most visible change in the speed. Most things on phones don't really take that long anymore, and they wanted to highlight just how fast the new OS is, so they reduced the boot time by half. JD The conversation started like this. Googler 1: Android and Play services is a mess we have no fucking clue how to fix all these issues. Googler 2: Have we tried making new messaging apps? Googler 1: Yes but that didn't fix anything Googler 2: Add more Emojis and Sticker packs so they can vent their frustrations? Googler 1: Yes but still it didn't fix the bugs Googler 2: What do you think would fix it then? Googler 1: I told you we don't know how, I have to keep rebooting my phone just to keep it working. Googler 2: Genius! You solved it! Just make the phone reboot faster! Maybe make it loop automatically. Googler 1: Why did LG let you go again? Maxwell “Max” Weinbach yep Stu The estimates are probably generous but I do feel like Android has finally matured with nougat and it would make sense if the OS became a lot more refined from this point forward. Not a parallel comparison obviously, but you saw similar with iOS. JD The last time it matured was with 4.4 then Google decided it was time trade the T mature for an N in 5.0 and kept that up all the way in to 7.0 Beebs Vaporware. Samsung has me on Android 4.4 kit kat D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, I wonder how this translates to actual real-world use. Like is it possible to notice the difference? From what I've heard, that seems to be the case. deh2002 Will be great for LG buyer's Dmitry Stepanushkin 2x faster bootloops? LineOS for exynos! LMAO! But I love lg just1box Google needs to focus on ONLY THREE things. 1. steamlined/faster OS updates 2. SINGLE All in one rich text messaging app standard across ALL devices and web/PC app 3. really goose Dev's to optimize apps for tablets (The fact the tablet section in PlayStore has basically 5 MORE apps than ALL of Windows 10 app availability is offensive this far along in Android.) Rod I'd add in standby battery drain in there, too. Rod Does this mean Android phones won't be embarrassed at PhoneBuff speed tests anymore? Yay! Maxwell “Max” Weinbach if you do the Pixel vs the iPhone 7, i think the pixel would win. A nexus 6p vs S8, the nexus wins. Rod Are we watching the same videos? Roh_Mish Would love this on my XZ. It is a solid performer but my god does it take its own sweet time booting up. Lars Jeppesen Why do you boot your device? Keep it alive, dawg.. Roh_Mish Mostly because sometimes due to really heavy use i drain my battery and it shuts down by night. Before 7.1 i had it get really laggy and i had to reboot. Сергей Бугаев They did mention some details about how they accomplished this, for example concurrent garbage collection and heap defragmentation, but we'll hear more in the dedicated ART news session. Cakefish Yay. This is great stuff. abc I'll believe it when I see it. Denholm Willmer My Pixel XL is consistently booting up in under 5 seconds with this update JD Nice, now they can join the iPhone and S6 since 2015 create812 I must say, my phone reboots super quick now. just1box "Now reboots 2x as fast!" wtf? Well shuck the corn and light the barn fires! Since rebooting IS THE ABSOLUTE LEAST FREQUENT ACTIVITY, assigning development to speed it up seems like THE LAMEST waste of talent/time. Clearly, the Android team has NOTHING else important to tackle. Reboot 2x as fast TF!

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 112 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares294 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? Maxr1998 1) No, it isn't. Just look at Linux/Windows. There you need root/admin access for installing or updating applications all the time. You type in your password (on Linux) or click grant, done! Same with using e.g. SuperSu on Android, you grant the su request, done. 2) Google doesn't use it to protect YOUR data, they provide it as DRM method for 3rd parties - basically "locking down" your device. 3) Uhmmm.. Nope? If you root your device, apps can't just use the su rights without your permission - except if they use an exploit, which would also work on an unrooted device. And if you yourself give a malware app su rights because you couldn't understand the situation, it's completely your own fault. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky What can I say, I have a VERY cynical view of the world. This world is going to hell is a handcart and every day it's picking up speed. trparky What can I say, I have a VERY cynical view of the world. This world is going to hell is a handcart and every day it's picking up speed. Every day we're going faster and faster down that hill straight to hell. Those who have the money may survive but the rest of us poor slobs have no hope of surviving what's coming next. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. someone755 I don't think that's true -- new Android users will soon enough become old ones, and with that they'll learn that the platform (especially update-wise) is a mess without some system privileges beyond those needed to change the display brightness. Not being to use the core functions of the ecosystem that we pay to use because we decide we deserve to have more control over the devices we pay for is absolutely on Apple's level, if not made worse because of the implication that this OS is somehow different from iOS. Windows Vista was a revolutionary piece of software, and people hated it. Why? Because what was expected from Microsoft was both huge change as well as keeping everything as it is -- and Vista was exactly that: an OS modern enough to be the core basis for Windows 7, and an inspiration for features several years into the future (Vista pioneered almost every feature that W7 had), with many similarities to Windows XP. But naturally because of the expectations, the OS failed miserably, being fondly remembered by nobody (with the exception of a few people, including myself). The ones who vote and voice their opinion are not always the brightest of people. Google's Treble is sure to mitigate Android's fragmentation *to some extent*, but it'll take several years for it to reach the majority of devices (based on the data that Nougat, today, works on 10% of devices, including custom ROM-ed ones, which, when talking about custom Android O ROMs, won't count towards the number of devices supporting Treble). We can't say this is unexpected -- after all, Google does bring features into Android that enthusiasts developed before official implementation. But this is a moot point if we consider that these things usually take at least three years. Tethering, using camera flash as a torch, quick settings and editing quick settings, even night light -- these are all root features that, when first introduced, were community hacks to improve Android devices, and they are all part of Google's Android (AOSP, even) today. If Google discourages rooting, they discourage development of future Android features, which are, historically, largely taken from the operating system's community of developers and enthusiasts. If that is how things must be in pursuit of a false sense of security and tighter control over the platform in the hopes of improving its quality, so be it. But saying that this is the platform I once adored is false -- if anything, this is its polar opposite; something we knew back in 2011 as "iOS". Corbin Baxter Android can still be rooted, and I don't think that Google is going to take that away. someone755 They aren't taking away the ability to root, no. They are, however, taking away the incentive to root, as well as root users' access to services they pay (or have paid) for. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. someone755 I respectfully disagree. There is no loss in stability aside from the forced Knox/SafetyNet/whatever software alerts from OEMs and Google, and there's definitely no loss in security -- if anything, the system is more secure because of my control over apps' privileges (i.e. I am free to control what apps do on my device, including stopping data theft by apps like Facebook etc). Why Google would have to be responsible for what a person does with their phone is beyond me -- the warranty doesn't cover it, and there are warnings of dos and don'ts plastered most everywhere online. (I'd very much like to say here that if you can't follow simple instructions you should go back to using tin cans on a string, but I realize that way 90% of the population would be excluded from the money making machine.) Simply put, I don't understand why Google would care over what the user can or can't do, as long as the user isn't somehow hurting the company (which, with root alone, they aren't and can't). Corbin Baxter You have a good point... bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. My1 if you are rooted and wanna watch netflix on mobile, you have not much choice. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. Jan-Lk Else OEMs don't care about customers, they care about money. And with Windows the OEMs don't need to provide updates themselves. trparky So why should I care about them? Why should I buy their products? Why should I give even one red cent of my money? That's right, I shouldn't and you shouldn't either. The only way to teach these companies is to hurt them where it hurts the most, in their bank accounts. A year or two of reduced profits from less device sales should send a clear message to them that unless they start supporting older devices (for at least three years) we won't buy their new devices, simple as that. I myself voted with my wallet, I bought an iPhone. I'm guaranteed updates the same day that everyone else gets the updates. I'm guaranteed updates for at least four years. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

For instance, when we discuss Google search, we can include star positioning, legitimate on page advancement and different variables, which googles to decide the expert of our site. However, now and again we run over the edge with our SEO usage and winds up making our blog look like SEO prostitute, and n return Google punish our website. On the off chance that you are pondering what will happen when Google punish your site: You will lose web positioning You will lose web crawler perceivability Your traffic will drop Thus, you will lose cash There are numerous things which we ought not do to guarantee; we don't get punished by Google look or other web indexes. Particularly, after calculation refreshes like Penguin, Page format, it's turned out to be important to guarantee that we don't do any senseless or alternate way technique to get higher positioning in inquiry. Here I'm sketching out few of the reasons which can punish any site: Why Does Google Penalizes Website: Here I'm sharing 5 reasons which generally hamper your positioning and Google may punish your blog. Calculations/algorithm: Try not to mishandle the calculation with fake practices, for example, the page content has nothing to do with what you Google. Numerous website admins exploit this to put watchwords that have nothing to do with the substance and are guaranteed of a place, despite the fact that that has nothing to do. While this might be counterproductive, in light of the fact that if the Google bot is distinguished, which occurs much of the time, criminalizes the site being referred to Shrouding : Numerous website admins program their site pages for two sorts of visits, a typical client, and a Google robot. This will make two sorts of pages, one with the biggest number of watchwords made for the visit of the robot that is practically ambiguous and an ordinary client. With this, the designers plan to trick the Google robot to position your site as high as could be expected under the circumstances, yet Google is distinguishing these pages and obviously the punishments. Entryway : With this procedure, the website admin encodes a page with numerous catchphrases, upgraded for certain hunts, with a Javascript divert to a site utilizing coded effectively, with the expectation to cheat Google, on the grounds that the robot does not perceive javascript. With this kind of practice, Google can erase the entire site. Shrouded Text: Some website admin shrouds catchphrases by just putting an indistinguishable shading from the foundation, so the client won't be influenced since the presence of the page holds. Reflect pages: Copy pages with a similar substance are punished by Google since clients can achieve more than once to a similar data. Despite the fact that 20-30% post trickery doesn't influence positioning, trying too hard, will make your blog/site resemble a substance scrapper website and Google may expel you from hunt.

Patent owners have terminated licensing for some MP3-related technologies, signaling the format's death. MANILA, Philippines – This week, the biggest news in tech was the WannaCry ransomware attack, which "kidnapped" computers the world over – hundreds of thousands of them – for a ransom fee of a few hundred dollars. WannaCry temporarily put a halt to normal operations to several industries, the most worrying of which is the UK's National Health Service (NHS). The NHS's computers were held hostage by the virus, dangerously slowing down their operations and jeopardizing the lives of patients. No one was reported to have died as a direct cause of the ransomware, but you can see the scary effect it has on healthcare services. (Read: What we've learned from WannaCry ransomware attacks) Google had its I/O developer conference this week too where they said that the company's direction shifts from being "mobile-first" to "AI-first." Their first big move: bringing Google Assistant to Apple devices. In the Philippines, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas advised would-be ransomware victims to not pay the attackers, saying that would only incentivize their efforts, encouraging them to pull off more attacks. In light of the cyber threats, broadband service provider Converge ICT brought some good news, announcing their 25Mbps/P1500 a month home broadband plan. Considering to switch? Before you do though, make sure to check out the other tech stories – small ones, big ones, medium-sized ones – in this week's edition of the Tech Roundup. R.I.P. MP3 The popular audio file format reaches the end of days. The owner for certain MP3-related patents, Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, announced on Monday, May 15, US time, that they've terminated its licensing program for the patents. That means no one will be able to develop MP3-based products at this point, meaning that the format is dead. But to be clear, you'll still be able to play MP3 files with available devices or programs now. When the institute terminated its licensing program, MP3 files the world over didn't drop dead like cyborgs getting the killswitch. MP3 died because, according to the institute, more advanced codecs are now available. Don't use cellphones while driving Formally known as the "Anti-Distracted Driving Act," the law took effect May 18. It bans drivers from using mobile device to write, send or read text-based messages and from making or receving calls. Also prohibited: playing games, watching movies, surfing the internet, composing messages, reading e-books, and performing calculations. The prohibitions apply whether a car is stopped or not.

The photo-sharing social network launched theirs (called "Face Filters") on Tuesday, May 16, US time. For users of Snapchat, the filters work pretty much the same way: one points the camera at a face, and chooses a filter to use, ranging from koala ears, bunny ears to leafy crowns. The filters are the last major Snapchat feature Instagram took for themselves, adding to a list that includes vanishing posts and messages, and virtual stickers. "This is the way the tech industry works," says Instagram's VP of product, Kevin Weil in an interview with TechCrunch. Google announces Android for low-cost phones, Android Go At its developer conference, Google announced that they are crafting a lighter version of Android called Android Go. Go is designed to work even on devices with less than 1GB of RAM, devices that are definitely in entry-level territory. It's also being optimized for developing countries where internet bandwidth is slow or expensive. Apps for Go will be optimized to use less RAM, less storage, and mobile data, said Google. Go is expected to be implemented by manufacturers on their devices in 2018. Here's the Android presentation at Google I/O: 360-degree YouTube videos to be available on TV Google also announced that YouTube's 360-degree videos will be coming to TVs soon. Currently, the said videos are only available on smartphones and web browsers. Google said the videos will be coming in the next few months to Android TV, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and 2017 4K TVs from LG and Samsung. A remote or a game controller will be used to rotate the view as opposed to swiping it on a phone or clicking and holding on a computer. Neon Genesis Evangelion will have a VR game After Dragon Ball, it's Neon Genesis Evangelion that's hopping aboard the VR bandwagon with a VR arcade game coming in the 3rd quarter of 2017. The game, according to Japanese games magazine Famitsu, will reportedly allow you to control one of the titular giant mechs: Eva-00, Eva-01, and Eva-02. The game will reportedly be called "Evangelion VR: The Throne of Souls." A video has surfaced on YouTube showing footage from the game: The VR treatment feels like a great match for the source material as players get to essentially become a pilot for the giant bio-mechanical robots.

This is where experience comes into play, where more experienced developers will probably be better at coming up with code that is more efficient, so like we said, not all apps are created equal. Google knows this and this is also something they want to help improve, which is why Google now has a new way of informing developers if their apps just aren’t quite up to scratch. Basically what happens is that if an app is ranked in the bottom 25% when it comes to stability, battery efficiency, or rendering metrics, Google will notify the developer via the developer console. Google revealed six different metrics that they will use to determine if an app has been made poorly, which includes error messages such as “Application not responding error”, experiencing at least one crash, where it keeps a device awake for more than an hour, an app that wakes a device up more than 10 times an hour, apps that run slower than 60fps, and laggy frame rendering. Of course whether or not the developer chooses to respond to Google’s advice/suggestions is a different story, but back in February Google did state that how well an app performs will affects its promotability, meaning that poorly-made apps could be less visible than better-made ones, so that should be incentive enough for developers to improve on their work.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Dennis Ulijn Yeah, last weeks i had the bug where system was using a lot of battery... I don't care right now, because i'm not expecting good battery life while on a beta. I did find a fix for system battery usage on Reddit though, which is to reset app preferences (which mostly only resets permissions and things like default apps. PI When in fist saw it ,,I was like WTH 32% but then it's beta software ,,so we kinda expect it . Yes per app battery usage section with foreground and background Info is really great . But I suspect google play services and Android os battery section will not be effective that much unless they show wahts making them to suck up battery . Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. David Onter You can disable all notifications from an app, which removes the permanent notification. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

Google Home now streams TV content from many more services, including HBO Now and Hulu Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/17 11:53am PDTMay 17, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 29 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares79 Google Google Home News One of the most interesting new features introduced during the Google I/O keynote has to be the integration between Google Home and Chromecast. The intelligent assistant can now show visual responses to interactions you have with via any Chromecast connected TV. For a while now we've been able to play videos through our Chromecast via YouTube and Netflix, and now many more services are being added. You can now ask Google Home to play content from new partners such as HBO Now, Hulu, CBS All Access, CW, and many more. This also includes support for Google services such as Google Play Movies & TV plus new cloud DVR platform YouTube TV. If you know what you want to watch you can dive into any of those products using Google Home and have it play whatever you desire. It can also come in handy if you don't really know what you want to watch... During his segment in the keynote, Google's Vice President of Product Management and General Manager of Google Home (longest job title ever) demoed visual responses with the YouTube app as he asked: "what's on YouTube?" This brought up his own personal recommendations on his TV. He then asked it to show him his Watch Later list and then asked for a specific video from and it, which it the played. While this is a staged product demo it looked undoubtedly impressive, especially the and contextual element of the conversation. Next up, the feature was put to use with new YouTube Tv service, which offers live TV streaming as well cloud DVR functionality through which you can play saved episodes of your favorite programs. In typically meta Google fashion the example that was chosen to play was the episode of Modern Family in which Google Home makes a cameo. Very Clever. Check out the rest of our coverage from Google I/O's 2017 keynote for more exciting new announcements. Tags chromecast google home hbo now hulu io17 io2017 tv youtube subscribe ...

Scott Scrivens Plex wasn't mentioned sadly, here's the point where it's discussed: https://youtu.be/Y2VF8tmLFHw?t=1h15m34s Isaac Fischer Plex will probably have to be from a Plex Cloud server.

It's almost worth dropping HBO from my plan and getting HBO Now. Abhimanyu Seth Typo: unnecessary 'and' >> especially the and contextual element of the conversation. Mario E Hdez Honest question, is google home worth purchasing? My home isn't very smart although I do have a ring doorbell, and recently purchased philips hue for one room. I also own 2 chromecasts. I've been on the fence about it for a while since it's missing basic features but to those of you who have now had ample time to live with it what do you think? A neighbor is offering his for 100 bucks. JG I enjoy mine. Hands free voice searches are very continent. There are times when she isn't able to do seemingly simple tasks that can get annoying. Maybe the neighbor would let you borrow it for a few days to try it out first, see if it works. JG Just HBO Now? What about HBO Go? Berni Hargrove Is "now" an accurate term for HBO Now, and Hulu integration? It's Sunday now and not a peep about the added services being live for anyone.

That’s a huge problem John Brandon@jmbrandonbb May 20, 2017 10:14 PM Above: Google Assistant logo Image Credit: Alphabet Voicebots are all over my house right now. I’m testing two different Alexa-powered speakers in my office. I use Cortana on a desktop, Siri on my MacBook and an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Assistant on a Pixel smartphone and the Google Home speaker, and both the Google Assistant and Siri on my television (thanks to the NVIDIA Shield and the Apple TV). I’m literally talking to bots all day, asking about the weather, the NBA Playoffs, and even obscure questions about Austria (where a few family members live). I’m known to suddenly say “OK, Google” during family meals when someone asks a question or makes a random comment. (Turns out, the Beauty and the Beast fable was published way back in 1740 and good old Tom Brady is the oldest quarterback in the NFL.) Sadly, now that the Assistant is available for iPhone, I’m going to have to change my approach. At a restaurant recently, I found out the hard way that the Assistant app doesn’t respond to “OK, Google” requests. It works exactly like any app on the iPhone that is not directly tied into the OS. That is, you can only talk to the iPhone by saying “Hey, Siri” to start a conversation. That’s not surprising at all. Android needs a few differentiators these days, right VentureBeat editorial team? Yet, the reason it’s sad is that there isn’t any reason to ever use the Assistant on iOS. To do that, I’d have to pick up my phone. Or, to be honest, fish my phone of my pocket. Then, I might have to type on my phone. The reality is that user interface dynamics have changed in 2017. I’m typing a lot less. After work, I rarely use apps at all anymore. I will use a laptop to type up documents and check email, but for most activities — asking questions, closing a garage door, starting a movie, setting a reminder — I usually talk to a voicebot from across the room. This is another reason chatbots are not as vital to my daily routine. I’m living in a world that science fiction predicted a long time ago, mostly on Star Trek. Here’s a good example. I’m leaving for a grad ceremony soon. To figure out when I should leave the house, in the past I’d have had to find my phone, start the Google Maps app, type in the address, retype the address because I spelled the street name wrong, do a search, then check the miles, and get a time estimate. That’s not a Herculean task (try figuring it out with an actual map), but with a voicebot, I don’t have to even look up from my cereal bowl. I say: “OK, Google, how far is it to France Avenue in Bloomington” and get the answer within seconds — it’s 58 miles. Some voicebots will tell me about traffic. Alexa can tell me, rather proactively, about the hours of the facility and will even give me the full address and phone number. With the Google Home speaker, I can then call that location. Yet the minute I have to use an app and type something, it suddenly takes much longer — maybe 10 minutes total. Voicebots literally give us back more time in our day. “OK, Google” doesn’t work that way on the iPhone, though. This means I’ll never use it. And over the next months and years, it’s less likely I’ll use any apps. The Assistant may be nice to have, and I’ll likely use it on a plane or when I’m the passenger in a car, but it’s mostly just a secondary option. Or, most likely, not an option at all.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.56am EDT 06:56 IN CASE YOU MISSED IT AFL: Essendon pumped the Eagles and North held firm against the Demons before Freo easily accounted for Carlton to end the round. NRL: Penrith came over the top of a hapless Newcastle, the Roosters did enough to deny the Bulldogs and the Storm went back to the top in a scrappy affair against the Bunnies. Super Rugby: The Waratahs hopes of a post-season berth remain alive after smashing the Rebels, who are in more trouble than the early settlers. PLAY OF THE DAY It’s hard to believe Suliasi Vunivalu is only 21. With wet-weather limiting scoring opportunities in the second stanza, the ledger was stuck at 10-6 for well over half an hour. But with the game to be won the Fijian’s class shone through with a rapid run to the corner. He had to drag a couple of prospective tacklers over the line with him, showing he has the strength to complement speed. Scary. TODAY’S BIG WINNER Melbourne Storm carried plenty of baggage into today, with a star again plastered over the back pages for the wrong reasons. And after conceding 38 points in a bad loss last week – the third time they had given up 20+ in a month – there were chinks for all to see. But we should know better than to question this fighting force. Not a lot about their victory over Souths was enjoyable, but under Bellamy and Smith they know what they need to do and when. The fact that they had to fly from Brisbane to Melbourne then Perth for the match underscores how impressive it was. They’ve earned their trip back to the top of the NRL. A mention also to the other Victorian team topping the pops: Melbourne Vixens. They needed a win today to regain primacy at the conclusion of the penultimate round of Super Netball, and motored home by 21 goals over Adelaide. TODAY’S BIG LOSER West Coast have a Melbourne problem. What is it? Don’t they like coffee? Or music? Or culture? They didn’t like their afternoon at the Docklands, that’s for sure. The Bombers leapt out of the blocks and maintained a ten-goal margin for the bulk of the second half. Joe Daniher was outstanding early for the winners, finishing with five majors. Earlier generations of Eagles were dominant at home, but always serviceable in Victoria. If this current crop can’t find a way to do likewise, they’ll never truly threaten when it matters. COMEBACK OF THE DAY Newcastle was in complete control at half-time, 14-0 at home and looking set to leave the bottom of the NRL ladder. But Penrith had other ideas. Last week the Panthers set records coming back from a 28-6 deficit to overcome the Warriors, so this was a relative doddle. They ended up piling on 30 points in the half and winning by ten to secure consecutive wins for the first time in 2017, keeping their season alive. IF TODAY WERE A SONG Going back to Melbourne, the stoush between North and Melbourne was defined by surges of momentum. The Kangaroos kicked six in the first term, so the Dees did the same in the second. Rinse and repeat. So it did, indeed, oscillate wildly. Of course, Moz doesn’t endorse actions of various players who hit each other during said game.

Not only as it comes the week after a bad loss to the Titans, but because they will be ravaged by Origin duties over the coming period. The second half in the rain was rough and rugged, the only score coming through Vunivalu’s potent run to the corner with five minutes to go to take the score from 14-6 and Melbourne to victory. Cameron Smith, the Storm skipper, on the telly after the game: “We were pretty embarrassed with how we defended last week,” he said. “We had clear intentions to defend our way to a win, and we did that really well.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.09am EDT 06:09 Storm try! That should be the game. Brilliant 50 metre movement and Vunivalu cannot be stopped in his push to the corner. Souths a long way off it now given the lack of scoring opportunities. His ninth try of the season. Cameron Smith misses to the right, so it’s 14-6. Rabbitoh’s have had 60% of the possession, but haven’t converted that to territory gained in this second half. After Melbourne leaked points over the last month, they’ll be very happy with the defensive effort in the second period.

Not wrong that there was a lot going on in that second quarter. Frustrating outing for Dees. They must have expected a lot more today. They’re not far away. “I would never say it cost us the game - Melbourne didn’t play well enough to win - but I never want to see umpiring as bad as that again as long as I live. How is it even possible for a payer to be punched so hard that he has to leave the ground, at a stoppage, right in front of the umpire, and no free kick is paid? How can an umpire award a mark, see the player who took the mark grabbed and thrown to the ground after the whistle has blown, and no 50 metres is paid?

It’s over in Perth, where twelfth placed South Sydney host an annual fixture, against the Storm, who are third on the ladder but battling of late on and off the park. The storm lost 38-36 to Cowboys last week in a performance defined by sloppy defence. They’ve now conceded 20 or more points three of the last four weeks. Not very Melbourne Storm, that. But it’s been nearly two years since they have lost two on the bounce. They also go into the game with star Jesse Bromwich across the papers apologising for his cocaine scandal after the Anzac Test. He sits out today though, the second of a two-week sanction from the club. Two weeks for getting done for coke? Draw your own conclusions. Souths had their most impressive outing of 2017 last week, smashing Wests 28-8. It should fuel them with confidence that they can get over the line after falling short against Melbourne by a converted try or less in each of their last three matches. Early on, they have a try apiece.

Why Should we Archive? Published: Sunday, May 21, 2017, 9:00 [IST] These days, most of us use Google Mail or Gmail to deal with our daily emails. However, the problem no is that we tend to get a lot of emails from our boss, the website we just subscribed, and other random unnecessary emails. Google help you in organizing all these random mail through a tool called Archiving. It will help you clean up the interface without having to spend more time on placing each email into a distinctive folder. Making it simple, archiving is an act of taking an email and placing it in a folder where it will continue to exist without cluttering your inbox. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! How is archive different from deleting? Deleting an email will directly send it to trash, which in a way is a backup as well, but for a limited amount of time, say 30 days. While using the trash folder to clean up your inbox might seem like a good idea, however, you will most likely lose an email that you might need in the future. Why should we archive? In case if you want an email that has important information like bank details, address, or other info's which you might not need it now, and for some amount of time in which you would have never needed to look back. In case, if you deleted the email thread, you wouldn't be able to look back. If you archived an email, you will no longer have to see it sitting in your inbox, but just a quick search will do. SEE ALSO: Reliance Jio becomes the fourth largest wireless telecom operator in India How to archive an email? One of the easiest ways to archive your email individually is to select the mail and swipe it left. If you accidentally send the mail to an archive, Google also offers you an option to undo it. You can quickly turn this feature off if you do it a lot on accident. To do this, open up the navigation drawer -> Settings -> General settings -> swipe to archive -> turn off. Another method is to select the mail individually, which you need to archive and tap on the box icon with an arrow pointing downwards. In case, if you want to clean up a bunch of emails, you can select it and tap on the same box icon.   Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

But touch on his passion for coding and why he joined Google’s Code in the Community Programme, and his attention is all yours. “I want to learn more about coding. Especially (the programming language) Scratch, which can be used to make games. Because it’s fun to play those games,” said the Sembawang Primary School Student, who is also among the first 500 kids to be enrolled in the programme. Arshad's current inspiration is the mobile phone game Dream League Soccer, and its accurate portrayal of the beautiful game digitally - from how balls are dribbled, the free kicks made and the penalties saved. But after 10 weeks of programming his own projects under Google’s tutelage, he appears to appreciate the sheer amount of effort that goes into coding seemingly simple actions and animations. “That would be extremely hard! Since these (Google) projects already have such long scripts, can you imagine the more developed game,” said Arshad. “It’ll take the hardest of skills!” Google’s 20-week programme is a multi-level computer science education initiative for children aged 8 to 15, and is funded by the tech giant with support from the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC), the Eurasian Association (EA), Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) and Yayasan Mendaki. Together, they aim to enable 3,000 kids from less-well-off backgrounds to develop computational thinking and skills for a possible future career in technology.

(Photo: Loke Kok Fai) To be eligible, students would need to be a beneficiary of the four self-help groups, or means-tested as a low-income family by the groups. They may also be eligible if they are currently under the Ministry of Education's Financial Aid Scheme. Speaking at an event marking the completion of the programme’s first term on Saturday (May 20), Google Asia Pacific’s Director of People Operations D N Prasad said plans were in place to further scale the programme to the wider community. “(It’s) also for us to bring in the diversity and make this truly inclusive in the Singapore community. So the invites have been sent to all the other schools and we do hope that the initial success and then the results, the positive results that we will show, will encourage more people to come and work with us in the future,” said Mr Prasad. “We’re trying to drive (this) long-term, with a long-term vision. It doesn’t matter who’s driving it – there needs to be just many players with the right intent and heart in the right place. And it’s our way of adding to the community and playing our part in the community as well as in partnership with everything the Government is doing or other institutions might be working on as well.” SINDA President Indranee Rajah, who paid the students a visit, said coding was something that students should acquire naturally through fun and play so that it becomes an integral part of life. Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law Indranee Rajah participates with students at the Google Asia Pacific offices. (Photo: Loke Kok Fai) “We didn’t want to put it as part of the formal school curriculum because that makes it yet another subject that you have to learn and test and be marked for. You don’t want to do that - you want it in the context of play,” said Ms Indranee, who is also Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law.  “If you expose somebody at a young age, you allow them the freedom to absorb this and to play with it and to let them create with it, it just becomes something that is an inherent skill. And hopefully as they go forward in life, they will not have any fear of IT, of coding, and they will be well equipped for the future economy.” Ms Indranee also highlighted grassroots and Government efforts such as Tiong Bahru Community Centre’s subsidised coding course for kids, as well as the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s Digital Maker Programme. GREATER EXPOSURE NEEDED IN SCHOOLS: PARENTS Parents Channel NewsAsia spoke with appreciated the opportunity to allow their child greater exposure to computing and programming literacy. Some pointed out that just a handful of schools offered computing and programming - whether as part of the formal syllabus or not. “If they can introduce this into the schools it’ll be good. But if (students) have to go out to learn it, parents may say the pocket’s a bit tight,” said Gary Siriniwas, a father who sent his 10- and 12-year-old children for Google’s course. Gary Siriniwas (R) is introduced to a micro:bit, used by his children participating in the programme. (Photo: Loke Kok Fai) Lessons or training pitched at younger students or beginners by local third-party external groups could range from S$150 for six sessions to thousands of dollars for in-depth courses, according to checks by Channel NewsAsia. “If they can put it in the schools and then charge it as part of school fees, people will do it. And we must do it or we’ll be left behind,” said Mr Siriniwas. “It’s just like what China does - they get their children at five-years-old, teach them gymnastics, they become the world’s best. We can adopt the same thing - train them up at a small age, and then they’ll be one of the best people in the world in future. “ Jess Eng, who enrolled her 15 year-old-daughter in Google’s programme, said she agreed that there is merit in introducing programming and computing as an examinable subject for the Primary School Leaving Examination - as an optional subject for students with potential. “You see the technology - you can’t live without a phone these days. So it’s very different from our time 20 years back, our parents’ time,” said Ms Eng. “You should forsee down the road, what you should be doing for your kids.” Registration for the 2018 cohort of the Code in the Community Programme will open at the end of the year.

Dave Burke, Google Vice President of Engineering for Android, speaks during the opening keynote address at the Google I/O 2017 Conference. Image: Getty Images/ By Karissa Bell2017-05-20 13:55:39 UTC Though we got out first peek at Android O back in March, Google finally revealed  more details this week at its I/O developers conference about the soon-to-drop version of Android. Though we're still quite a ways away from the official release, we now a lot more about the update. At first glance, many of the new changes are subtle, building on updates Google introduced last year with Nougat. (Yes, it's another boring year for Android.) SEE ALSO: Google is boring now, and that's bad news for innovation Still, there are quite a few features to look forward to, here's what's caught our eye so far. 1. No more broken emoji ☐ Tired of missing out on new emoji? Android O will help ensure you never miss out on the latest releases. A new feature for developers lets them integrate a new emoji library that automatically fills in missing emoji even if you don't have it available yet in your keyboard. The new emoji feature will help fill in missing characters. Image: google 2. Smart Sharing Android O is able to understand what's in your photos and recommend specific apps and actions based based on what's in it the composition and your prior behavior. "If a user takes a photo of a receipt, Android O can suggest an expense-tracking app; if the user takes a selfie, a social media app can better handle the image," Google says. This also applies to videos, URLs, text, and other types of content — your phone can learn what you typically do with different types of content to improve its recommendations. 3. Cleaner Icons Android developers can now create an array of icons to match the styles for different devices. This mean if you use a phone that defaults to round app icons, apps that have typically used square icons now have the ability to use round ones instead. Image: google 4. Notification Snoozing Android O is placing a lot of emphasis on improving notifications. One notable tweak will be the ability to snooze a notification for later.  5. Badge Notifications  One of the biggest changes to notifications is the addition of badge notifications — small dots that appear over an app icon to indicate a new notification from that app. Additionally, you can long press on an app to check its notifications.  Image: google 6. Background colors for notifications  Another small but noticeable way Google is redesigning the look and feel of notifications: Developers will have the ability to enable background colors for notifications from their app.  But don't expect your notifications tray to look extra colorful — Google recommends developers "only use this feature in notifications for ongoing tasks which are critical for a user to see at a glance," like navigation or phone calls. 7. Notification Channels Besides just changing the look and feel of notifications, Android O is letting users have much more fine-grained control over which notifications they see in the first place with something called notification channels. Notification channels let you decide which types of notifications you want to see from your apps. Not many developers have had a chance to take advantage of this yet but as you can see in this example from the Google app, it lets you individually mute certain categories of notifications. 8. New Android TV Launcher  In addition to getting new superpowers thanks to Google Assistant, Android TV is getting a redesigned launcher menu that emphasizes content discovery. Image: google 9. New animation styles This one is a little more subtle: Android O is adding support for a new animation style called physics-based animation. "Physics-based animation relies on the laws of physics to manifest a high degree of realism in animation. In our day-to-day life, when a change occurs, it comes with a physical transition that is natural for us to recognize. " Image: google This will manifest in a few different styles of animations, but one is a new type called "fling animation," which helps you slow down motion at the end of a graphic. 10. Picture-in-picture It's been mentioned before but it bears repeating: Android O is getting support for picture-in-picture that works with any app, not just YouTube. It will take some time before more developers start adopting the feature, which is pretty buggy in the current developer preview, but PiP will definitely level up your multitasking.  WATCH: This gigantic vending machine spits out actual Ferraris Topics: Android, android-o, apps-and-software, Apps and Software, Google, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Whether at home or on the go, your Assistant is here to help. #io17 pic.twitter.com/a6T20HwnU9 — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 Google is finally bringing its powerful AI assistant to iPhones. As everyone from Microsoft to Samsung comes out with their own version, assistants are likely to be the next most important way to control your phone. Previously, operating systems were restrictive in nature. If you had an iPhone, Apple controlled your experience. Now with assistants like Siri, Google and Alexa being an increasingly dominant way to use your phone, it'll be the company that has the best assistant that will control your experience - and Google has a huge advantage with its knowledge graph. Instagram finally gets face filters  After a months long feature by feature cloning of Snapchat, Instagram's finally gets Snapchat's most iconic feature - the lenses, or as Instagram calls them "face filters." There are only eight filters for now, but Instagram is soon likely to have its own wide array of filters. Messenger gets a new layout Image: facebook messenger Facebook Messenger has an all new home screen. It now contains tabs for Messages, people who are “Active now" or online, and favorite groups. There’s also a new bottom bar for Home, Calls, Camera, People and Games. The Camera is a much more prominent part of Messenger than before, likely due to the Messenger Day feature. Uber adds transit information to Android Image: uber The ride-hailing service announced on Tuesday that its Android app will now allow users to easily access real-time public transportation data.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 319 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares533 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated. I'm ready to give up on android and an unreliable beta company. but add me to the list of sabotaged 6p lovers. Kelly Kay Mine shuts down at 25% without fail. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.49M 470k 144k 116k Latest Deals 11 [Deal Alert] 2-pack Samsung fast wireless chargers $55 at Woot ($45+ off) 2017/05/21 10:52am PDTMay 21, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Here are 12 temporarily free and 6 on-sale apps for your post-I/O weekend 2017/05/19 12:59pm PDTMay 19, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Samsung Gear 360 1st gen down to $168.55 on Amazon 2017/05/19 2:06am PDTMay 19, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get a UE ROLL 2 Bluetooth speaker in Sugarplum for just $45 ($55 off) on Amazon 2017/05/18 8:12pm PDTMay 18, 2017 1 [Deal Alert] Celebrate the start of Google I/O with 9 temporarily free and 10 on-sale apps, plus both 0.10 Apps of the Week 2017/05/17 9:09am PDTMay 17, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Rematch of man vs machine in ancient game By Afp Published: 22:22 EDT, 20 May 2017 | Updated: 22:22 EDT, 20 May 2017 e-mail Google's artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo will face the world's top-ranked Go player, China's 19-year-old Ke Jie, in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI It's man vs machine this week as Google's artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo faces the world's top-ranked Go player in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI. China's 19-year-old Ke Jie is given little chance in the three-game series beginning Tuesday in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen after AlphaGo stunned observers last year by trouncing South Korean grandmaster Lee Se-Dol four games to one. Lee's loss in Seoul marked the first time a computer programme had beaten a top player in a full match in the 3,000-year-old Chinese board game, and has been hailed as a landmark event in the development of AI. AI has previously beaten humans in cerebral contests, starting with IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, but AlphaGo's win last year is considered the most significant win for AI yet. Go is considered perhaps the most complex game ever devised, with an incomputable number of move options that puts a premium on "intuition." Proponents had considered it a bastion in which human thought would remain superior, at least for the foreseeable future. AlphaGo's triumph fuelled hopes of a brave new world in which AI is applied not only to driverless cars or "smart homes", but to helping mankind figure out some of the most complex scientific, technical, and medical problems. "AlphaGo's successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered," Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, said ahead of this week's matches. AI's ultimate goal is to create "general" or multi-purpose, rather than "narrow," task-specific intelligence -- something resembling human reasoning and the ability to learn. - Sci-fi nightmare? - But for some, it conjures sci-fi images of a future in which machines "wake up" and enslave humanity. Physicist Stephen Hawking is a leading voice for caution, warning in 2015 that computers may outsmart humans, "potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand." Ke faces AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Ke is a brash prodigy who went pro at 11 years old, has been world number one for more than two years, and has described himself as a "pretentious prick". After AlphaGo flattened Lee, Ke declared he would never lose to the machine. "Bring it on," he said on China's Twitter-like Weibo. But he has tempered his bravado since then. Ke was among many top Chinese players who were trounced in online contests in January by a mysterious adversary who reportedly won 60 straight victories. That opponent -- cheekily calling itself "The Master" -- was later revealed by DeepMind to have been an updated AlphaGo. "Even that was not AlphaGo's best performance," Gu Li, a past national champion, told Chinese state media last week. "It would be very hard for Ke to play against it, but then again, Ke has also been working extremely hard to change his methods in preparation. I hope he can play well." Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid. The winner is the player who seals off the most territory. AlphaGo uses two sets of "deep neural networks" containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught -- having played millions of games against itself after initial programming.

China’s 19-year-old Ke Jie is given little chance in the three-game series beginning Tuesday in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen after AlphaGo stunned observers last year by trouncing South Korean grandmaster Lee Se-Dol four games to one. Lee’s loss in Seoul marked the first time a computer programme had beaten a top player in a full match in the 3,000-year-old Chinese board game, and has been hailed as a landmark event in the development of AI. AI has previously beaten humans in cerebral contests, starting with IBM’s Deep Blue defeating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, but AlphaGo’s win last year is considered the most significant win for AI yet. Go is considered perhaps the most complex game ever devised, with an incomputable number of move options that puts a premium on “intuition.” Proponents had considered it a bastion in which human thought would remain superior, at least for the foreseeable future. AlphaGo’s triumph fuelled hopes of a brave new world in which AI is applied not only to driverless cars or “smart homes”, but to helping mankind figure out some of the most complex scientific, technical, and medical problems. “AlphaGo’s successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered,” Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, said ahead of this week’s matches. AI’s ultimate goal is to create “general” or multi-purpose, rather than “narrow,” task-specific intelligence — something resembling human reasoning and the ability to learn. Sci-fi nightmare? But for some, it conjures sci-fi images of a future in which machines “wake up” and enslave humanity. Physicist Stephen Hawking is a leading voice for caution, warning in 2015 that computers may outsmart humans, “potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand.” Ke faces AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Ke is a brash prodigy who went pro at 11 years old, has been world number one for more than two years, and has described himself as a “pretentious p****”. After AlphaGo flattened Lee, Ke declared he would never lose to the machine. “Bring it on,” he said on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. But he has tempered his bravado since then. Ke was among many top Chinese players who were trounced in online contests in January by a mysterious adversary who reportedly won 60 straight victories. That opponent — cheekily calling itself “The Master” — was later revealed by DeepMind to have been an updated AlphaGo. “Even that was not AlphaGo’s best performance,” Gu Li, a past national champion, told Chinese state media last week. “It would be very hard for Ke to play against it, but then again, Ke has also been working extremely hard to change his methods in preparation. I hope he can play well.” Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid. The winner is the player who seals off the most territory. AlphaGo uses two sets of “deep neural networks” containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain.  It is partly self-taught — having played millions of games against itself after initial programming. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows Free carpooling app for Singapore mosque-goers in time for Ramadan Watch out in a world of connected objects, cyber specialists warn ‘Father of the Internet’ Vint Cerf says we should reach for the stars Hackers steal 17 million users’ data from Indian restaurant app Zomato WannaCry: Simple steps to stay safe from ransomware Anonymous whiz kid foils WannaCry cyberattack Cyber kid stuns experts showing toys can be ‘weapons’ Wiko Harry smartphone enters Malaysia Hackers steal 17 million users’ data from Indian restaurant app Zomato Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Women in India ‘uproot’ marijuana problem Reuters Video: President Trump and First Lady Melania visit new Saudi centre combatting extremism Reuters Video: Oscars chief Boone Isaacs steps down from governors board Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles In battle of digital assistants, Google heads to Apple turf Baidu to launch self-driving car technology in July Toyota robot to keep elderly mobile, one step at a time (VIDEO) Smart condo conundrum: Talk to appliances, or text them?

Google Working On Chromebook Emulator For Android Devs Next Story Prev Story Saturday Read more: Ubergizmo So we know that Google is aiming for the Chromebook to run Android apps, however since Android apps are clearly designed for smartphones, this means that when used on a device with a larger display liked a laptop, it won't look the same and the experience won't be ideal, but Google has a plan to help with that. It seems that Google is working on a Chromebook emulator for Android app developers As the name suggests, this is an emulator designed to mimic a Chromebook or a device with a larger display, so that when Android developers are planning to make their apps compatible with Chrome OS, they can use the emulator to ensure that their apps are optimized for devices with larger displays.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 112 Share on Facebook 85 Share on Twitter Total Shares294 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? Maxr1998 1) No, it isn't. Just look at Linux/Windows. There you need root/admin access for installing or updating applications all the time. You type in your password (on Linux) or click grant, done! Same with using e.g. SuperSu on Android, you grant the su request, done. 2) Google doesn't use it to protect YOUR data, they provide it as DRM method for 3rd parties - basically "locking down" your device. 3) Uhmmm.. Nope? If you root your device, apps can't just use the su rights without your permission - except if they use an exploit, which would also work on an unrooted device. And if you yourself give a malware app su rights because you couldn't understand the situation, it's completely your own fault. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky What can I say, I have a VERY cynical view of the world. This world is going to hell is a handcart and every day it's picking up speed. trparky What can I say, I have a VERY cynical view of the world. This world is going to hell is a handcart and every day it's picking up speed. Every day we're going faster and faster down that hill straight to hell. Those who have the money may survive but the rest of us poor slobs have no hope of surviving what's coming next. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. someone755 I don't think that's true -- new Android users will soon enough become old ones, and with that they'll learn that the platform (especially update-wise) is a mess without some system privileges beyond those needed to change the display brightness. Not being to use the core functions of the ecosystem that we pay to use because we decide we deserve to have more control over the devices we pay for is absolutely on Apple's level, if not made worse because of the implication that this OS is somehow different from iOS. Windows Vista was a revolutionary piece of software, and people hated it. Why? Because what was expected from Microsoft was both huge change as well as keeping everything as it is -- and Vista was exactly that: an OS modern enough to be the core basis for Windows 7, and an inspiration for features several years into the future (Vista pioneered almost every feature that W7 had), with many similarities to Windows XP. But naturally because of the expectations, the OS failed miserably, being fondly remembered by nobody (with the exception of a few people, including myself). The ones who vote and voice their opinion are not always the brightest of people. Google's Treble is sure to mitigate Android's fragmentation *to some extent*, but it'll take several years for it to reach the majority of devices (based on the data that Nougat, today, works on 10% of devices, including custom ROM-ed ones, which, when talking about custom Android O ROMs, won't count towards the number of devices supporting Treble). We can't say this is unexpected -- after all, Google does bring features into Android that enthusiasts developed before official implementation. But this is a moot point if we consider that these things usually take at least three years. Tethering, using camera flash as a torch, quick settings and editing quick settings, even night light -- these are all root features that, when first introduced, were community hacks to improve Android devices, and they are all part of Google's Android (AOSP, even) today. If Google discourages rooting, they discourage development of future Android features, which are, historically, largely taken from the operating system's community of developers and enthusiasts. If that is how things must be in pursuit of a false sense of security and tighter control over the platform in the hopes of improving its quality, so be it. But saying that this is the platform I once adored is false -- if anything, this is its polar opposite; something we knew back in 2011 as "iOS". Corbin Baxter Android can still be rooted, and I don't think that Google is going to take that away. someone755 They aren't taking away the ability to root, no. They are, however, taking away the incentive to root, as well as root users' access to services they pay (or have paid) for. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. someone755 I respectfully disagree. There is no loss in stability aside from the forced Knox/SafetyNet/whatever software alerts from OEMs and Google, and there's definitely no loss in security -- if anything, the system is more secure because of my control over apps' privileges (i.e. I am free to control what apps do on my device, including stopping data theft by apps like Facebook etc). Why Google would have to be responsible for what a person does with their phone is beyond me -- the warranty doesn't cover it, and there are warnings of dos and don'ts plastered most everywhere online. (I'd very much like to say here that if you can't follow simple instructions you should go back to using tin cans on a string, but I realize that way 90% of the population would be excluded from the money making machine.) Simply put, I don't understand why Google would care over what the user can or can't do, as long as the user isn't somehow hurting the company (which, with root alone, they aren't and can't). Corbin Baxter You have a good point... bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. My1 if you are rooted and wanna watch netflix on mobile, you have not much choice. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. Jan-Lk Else OEMs don't care about customers, they care about money. And with Windows the OEMs don't need to provide updates themselves. trparky So why should I care about them? Why should I buy their products? Why should I give even one red cent of my money? That's right, I shouldn't and you shouldn't either. The only way to teach these companies is to hurt them where it hurts the most, in their bank accounts. A year or two of reduced profits from less device sales should send a clear message to them that unless they start supporting older devices (for at least three years) we won't buy their new devices, simple as that. I myself voted with my wallet, I bought an iPhone. I'm guaranteed updates the same day that everyone else gets the updates. I'm guaranteed updates for at least four years. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

That’s the advice from internet pioneer Vinton Gray Cerf, who is often referred to as one of the “Fathers of the Internet” for his role in co-developing the internet protocol suite and the architecture of the internet. With the internet firmly entrenched in our daily lives — affecting how we interact with each other, how we conduct business, and how we perceive the world — how much further can the internet go? An intragalactic network, or an internet for our galaxy, is the vision by Cerf, who bears the title of Google vice president and Chief Internet Evangelist. The future of the internet is going to get “bigger, faster... and integrated into our lives far more than it is today,” Cerf said in an interview with TODAY. In the not so distant future, internet-enabled devices will dominate the new wave. The widely-touted ‘Internet of Things’, or the connectivity of everyday objects, will be prevalent, together with machine learning and interactive artificial intelligence, said Cerf. “I think the internet will simply surround us in the future. It will be built into our offices, homes, vehicles, and maybe in our persons. It will just be there to serve us in the same way that electrical power is expected to come out of the wall at need.” Making the internet more secure The internet has certainly ignited a new economic growth engine for the world, creating enormous amounts of wealth and business for people with the applications that sit on top of it, said Cerf, citing the case of Google. Cerf added he is “pretty happy” with the results of the internet. The advent of the smartphone boom has further aided the growth of the internet community, he said. Today about 3.5 billion people are online. Cerf forecasts that another two to three billion people will go online by 2020. As benefits and economic gains are generated by the internet, the future of the internet also requires safety and security. “There’s no trivial cure for this,” said Cerf. To work towards a safer and more secure internet environment, the technical community has to minimise the mistakes they make when they write operating systems software and applications software, he said. Individuals need to be more aware about internet security and avoid unsecured products. “We have to recognise that if we are going to build devices for the net, we have to take extra steps to make sure we can protect ourselves from being invaded or controlled by people who are not authorised to do that,” said Cerf. Digital signatures, or other kinds of cryptographic methods can help, but “improving our ability to write software with fewer bugs in it and improving our ability to update software when we discover there are bugs, is a very important part of making the network safer for everyone to use.” As individual users, we can also play a part in practising internet security, such as adopting two-factor authentication, not clicking on potential phishing messages as well as not buying equipment and gadgets that are unsafe, Cerf said. Vision for the future Having worked on developing the system since its early days, Cerf says the internet was planned to be a global system since 1973. The power of the internet is far from its saturation point. The design of the internet allows it to adapt to new technologies and support new applications pretty much without an end in sight, shared Cerf. The internet was “designed to be expandable,” he said. The idea was “to allow new kinds of applications to be built on top of it.” He explained that the internet can support an arbitrarily large number of new applications, whether it is “voice or video or a piece of the webpage or a document or something else.” “That was a very, very deliberate design choice on our part, in order to permit that kind of exploration and growth… so there isn’t really any limitation to what you can do with software except your imagination and what you can programme.” Hence, the limitless boundaries of the internet – even beyond our world. There is “real incentive” to develop intragalactic networking, due to the solar systems that have been found in space, said Cerf. However, some barriers to the technology include communicating faster than the speed of light which is still a mystery to be solved. Currently, there are already developments to deliver scientific data back to researchers on Earth using a prototype interplanetary network between Earth, Mars and the International Space Station. “That’s functional, that’s real, that’s running. As new missions get launched we will continue to grow the interplanetary backbone. So from my point of view we have an architecture that we are pretty confident will work for solar system scale.” “Right now the hard part is doing it between here and Alpha Centauri (the closest star system to the solar system) or Beta Centauri. The Centauri system, that’s 4.3 light years away. That’s going to be harder to do,” Cerf said. Much as his sights are on the future, this “Father of the Internet” insists we do not forget history. Cerf is currently working on solving the problem of preserving digital content – photos, movies, documents, programmes, databases, application and operating system software. “We need technologies to run old software on emulated old hardware so we can see (in future) what our ancestors wrote, Tweeted, Facebooked or YouTubed about… Fortunately, it looks as if there may be some long-term solutions to this problem. But there is still a lot of work to be done to make this feasible.” — TODAY                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows Free carpooling app for Singapore mosque-goers in time for Ramadan Watch out in a world of connected objects, cyber specialists warn ‘Father of the Internet’ Vint Cerf says we should reach for the stars Hackers steal 17 million users’ data from Indian restaurant app Zomato WannaCry: Simple steps to stay safe from ransomware Anonymous whiz kid foils WannaCry cyberattack Cyber kid stuns experts showing toys can be ‘weapons’ Wiko Harry smartphone enters Malaysia Hackers steal 17 million users’ data from Indian restaurant app Zomato Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Women in India ‘uproot’ marijuana problem Reuters Video: President Trump and First Lady Melania visit new Saudi centre combatting extremism Reuters Video: Oscars chief Boone Isaacs steps down from governors board Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles In battle of digital assistants, Google heads to Apple turf Volvo to partner with Google on connected cars Parents need to monitor children’s internet use to avoid negative influence Lelaki guna ‘keldai akaun’ bank tipu jual kereta murah US regulator website hacked after TV host comments Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | May 19, 2017 -- 19:22 GMT (12:22 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Artificial intelligence is "the driving force of the fourth industrial revolution," Google's Fei-Fei Li argued during a panel discussion on the final day of Google's I/O developer conference. AI, she added, "has the potential to tranform the way humans live, work, communicate." That said, technologists have only just begun realizing the impact of AI. As it matures, vision is going to be the "killer app of AI," said Li, the chief scientist of AI and machine learning for Google's cloud unit. Reiterating points she recently made to TechCrunch, Li noted that 540 million years ago, vision was likely the driving force behind the Cambrian Explosion -- a relatively short period of time over which a great diversity of life forms appeared. "When eyes were first developed in animals, suddenly animal life becomes proactive... evolution has changed," she explained. Hundreds of millions of years later, humans are the most intelligent visual animals, with half of the human brain dedicated to visual processing. Meanwhile, the sheer scale of visual data in our current world speaks to its importance: It's estimated that more than 80 percent of all of cyberspace is in pixel form, Li noted. Google Cloud Platform customers, she noted, are asking about capabilities like video processing and video analytics. Computer vision, she stressed is "one of the most important elements of machine intelligence and the transformation of enterprise and companies." While the last 10 years have brought significant progress in basic perception tasks, such as object recognition and image tagging, Li called the next big phase "vision plus X." In other words, the transformation of enterprise will come with combining the capabilities of computer vision with other fields of study. For instance, she noted that vision plays a "fundamental" role in communication, opening up opportunities to combine vision and language capabilities for functions like indexing videos. Vision also has huge potential in biological sciences and robotics, she said. At I/O, Google showcased its advances in computer vision, which are helping to drive its AI-first strategy. The company revealed how it's bringing computer vision capabilities to various products this year, starting with Google Assistant and Google Photos. Artificial intelligence has reached its current inflection point, Li argued, because of the convergence of three factors: the maturation of machine learning tools, Moore's Law and the improvement of hardware and the emergence of big data. While this is a "historical moment" for AI, "it's just the beginning," she said. "The tools and technologies we've developed are really the first few drops of water in the vast ocean of what AI can do." Daphne Koller, chief computing officer at Google-founded Calico Labs, noted that big data is not yet as ubiquitous as some may think. "We might like to think big data is, at this point, the solution to everything," she said on the panel with Li. While it plays a major role in some sectors, "in others we are unfortunately still in the medium or even small data regime." With that in mind, she said there's still a need for "balancing human intuition... with the data we're acquiring."

What Happened to Transparency? May 21, 2017 16 4913 Simon Kolawolelive!, Email: simon.kolawoe@thisdaylive.com I need your help please. At the annual Nigerian jamboree to the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in Houston, Texas, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, the minister of state for petroleum resources, told a “world press conference” on May 5, 2017 that Nigeria’s refineries would soon have new investors. He said 26 investors had indicated interest in the epileptic refineries. “By September, we will unveil the investors for the refineries,” the minister said smoothly, typically. “When we came onboard, the refineries were not working but as we speak, we have sizeable investment portfolio for them to an extent that we don’t know who to partner with for the investment.” Let’s say I didn’t go to school at all. Or let’s say it was evening school that I attended. These would still be my takeaways from the minister’s proclamations: one, our refineries are now in a position to attract investment; two, 26 investors have indicated interest in taking over the refineries (on a repair, operate and maintain, ROM, agreement); three, we have not taken a decision yet because there are so many suitors to choose from; and four, we will announce the favoured investors by September. Without attending Harvard Business School, I would still conclude that it appeared the process was going to be competitive and transparent. On May 11, 2017 (six days later, right?) Mr. Wale Tinubu, the CEO of Oando Plc, told the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) that the group had received approval of the government to “repair, operate and maintain” the Port Harcourt Refinery together with “our partner” Agip, a subsidiary of ENI, the Italian company indicted in the Malabu/OPL 245 affair. Tinubu said: “We plan to increase the refinery capacity from 30 per cent to 100 per cent.” Great news, as far I am concerned. We need the refineries back as soon as possible; we have had enough of the endless TAMs gulping billions of naira and spewing out virtually no products for decades. Now this is where I need your help. The last time I checked, with the help of Google, May and September are different months. There are June, July and August in-between. With the help of Google, I also discovered that the gap between when Kachikwu spoke in Houston and when Tinubu spoke in Lagos was a whopping six days — or, to make it simpler, less than one week. There are usually four weeks in a month, and from May 5, when Kachikwu spoke, to September, there are 17 weeks, according to the all-knowing Google. With Tinubu’s disclosure, should we assume that May is the new September? Or that September came early for Oando, Agip and Kachikwu? But I think Google is overrated. There were so many questions it could not answer. For instance, I asked: “Is Oando among the 26 investors Kachikwu boasted about in Houston?” I could not make head or tail of the results. Google came up with “FOX 26 Houston KRIV”. Nonsense. But I got more gibberish for other questions: did Oando and ENI send in a bid? Was it an unsolicited bid? Was it selective tendering? If it was competitive bidding, how many bids were received for Port Harcourt? How much did Oando/ENI bid? How much did others bid? How much did the bidders promise to invest? How many years will the ROM run? Are there concessions for the new operators? I can understand why Google got stuck — that almighty search machine likes transparency. If you do not make your information public, it cannot make it public for you. The best, or should I say the worst, Google would do is to suggest answers that it thinks are related to your questions, even when there is no connection whatsoever. If you google most of the major concessions and major contracts awarded by this government, you will get irrelevant answers on the process. For the same reason: transparency is very scarce in these major deals. We just wake up one day and hear that one company has been awarded a job. Not a word on the process. Don’t get me wrong: I’m not saying Oando should not take over the Port Harcourt Refinery. I have devoted a significant part of my column-writing career to promoting the cause of Nigerian companies. I believe that one day, made-in-Nigeria will be enjoyed all over the world. I want Nigerian companies to fly our flag honourably. Even though I have been called names and subjected to sickening innuendos for promoting Dangote, Globacom, Oando and Innosons, among others, I am not about to repent. Americans are proud of their Apple, Microsoft and Chevron, and my dream is that our people and our companies will become global brands too. That said, though, I am very worried about an emerging pattern in this administration. President Muhammadu Buhari campaigned on the strength of correcting the mistakes and misdeeds of the previous government, but I am seeing too much repetition for it to be coincidental. There is too much secrecy in the way many important things are done, and corruption, need we say, thrives on secrecy. Take away competition, take away transparency, take away accountability, and you have a perfect recipe for corruption. We cannot be sealing deals under the table without revealing the details to Nigerians and then claim we are building an open society. We just woke up one day to learn that GE had secured the concession to take over the railways. How did it happen? What are the details of the deal? Is this the best possible deal Nigeria can get? We were just watching TV one evening and learnt that the federal government had finally signed a renegotiated concession agreement with the Global Steel Holding Limited (GSHL) for Ajaokuta Steel. Up till today, we don’t know the details. Ask questions and what you get as answer is: who paid you to ask? As a journalist, I’m used to the blackmail. I would have quit this job the day I joined if I had to pay attention to personal attacks. By the way, I know a bit about the procurement options. I know of “sole sourcing”, where you go to one provider only because no other provider does it — like buying a Rolls Royce from the maker. “Selective tendering” allows you to approach a few providers who meet certain criteria. There is “repeat procurement”, where you return to earlier provider because of time constraints and because they did a previous job well. All these need strong justifications because you are restricting competition, which is a major element of procurement. And then there is “competitive bidding”, where you throw it open to all. In all, Nigerians deserve to know the process adopted. Get me right. I am not saying anything illegal is being done in the case of the Port Harcourt Refinery. It just lacks transparency. That’s my point. And what about other moral issues? ENI again? As I write this, many Nigerians are being prosecuted or wanted by the EFCC for their involvement in the OPL 245 deal. They are being accused of taking part in an elaborate bribery scheme. But ENI, which is at the centre of it all and is being prosecuted by an Italian prosecutor for its role in the $1.3 billion affair, is cornering more deals in Nigeria without getting as much as a slap on the wrist. The impression being created is that our anti-graft war is very narrow. I sympathise with the government over the limitations imposed by procurement rules, particularly the constraint of speed, but the process was designed for a purpose. More so, this government has been in power for nearly two years, which means a lot could still have been accomplished over the years in spite of the constraints. And, remember, there are many options that can shorten the process which the government has been using for a while now. The biggest headache, though, is that there is too much opaqueness for us to conclude that transparency is a guiding principle. The chaos over the concessioning of Port Harcourt Refinery is a very good example. Dissonance. =========== “I sympathise with the government over the limitations imposed by procurement rules, particularly the constraint of speed, but this government has been in power for nearly two years, which means a lot could still have been accomplished over the years in spite of the constraints” =========== AND FOUR OTHER THINGS NORTHERN ELDERS Dr. Junaid Mohammed, the northern “elder” who promised Nigerians hell if power did not return to the “north” in 2011, is at it again. This time, the “elder” says if Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo becomes president, for any reason, before 2019, the “north” will insist on getting fresh two terms starting from 2019. What an elder! Any society with this character as an elder is doomed. He is certainly not my elder. It may interest him to know that no part of Nigeria can produce a president all by itself. Go and check the 2015 election results. Buhari would not have won by northern votes alone. Statements like this can set the nation on fire. Reckless. BUDGET SIGNING The 2017 federal budget is now ready and, all things being equal, the next thing is presidential assent. Since President Muhammadu Buhari is on medical leave and Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is the “co-ordinator” of activities, many have asked: “Who signs?” Alhaji Lai Mohammed, information minister, said “that decision will be taken when the budget is transmitted to the presidency”. On his part, Senator Ita Enang, special adviser to the president on national assembly matters, said, before backtracking, that “the budget will be transmitted to Mr President and the president will assent to the budget.” Have these guys ever read section 145 (1) of the 1999 constitution at all? Amusing. MACRON WAVE Hurray! The national assembly is planning to amend several sections of the 1999 constitution to allow younger people to contest for office. In the wave of the election of 39-year-old Emmanuel Macron as French president, the #NotTooYoungToRun campaign has been reborn in Nigeria. The proposal is to reduce the qualification ages from 40 to 30 (presidential), 35 to 30 (governorship) and 30 to 25 (national assembly). But wait. We often think the law is our problem, yet how many 30-years-olds get appointed as ministers despite the fact that the constitution allows it? In any case, changing the law is easier; preparing our youth for leadership is the real deal. Imperative. BEST AND WORST Patrick Asadu, a member of the house of reps, has said the worst PDP government is better than the current APC administration. The lawmaker from Enugu state said: “The PDP government was not and could never have been perfect, and [only a] few human endeavours are totally perfect, but the worst of the PDP government is 100 times better than the best of the present APC government.” Given that the PDP ruled Nigeria for 16 years, during which the country did not exactly become South Korea, and APC has only ruled for two years, can Asadu be more circumspect? I agree that APC is fumbling, but it is not as if PDP set the world on fire in its first two years either. Exaggeration.

B. JOSHUA Backpage On The Greatness of Nigeria obinnna77 Typical. You couldn’t resist harping on Dr Kachikwu’s ‘smoothness’, could you? Grates on your nerves, doesn’t it? Such pettiness detracts from the weight of your analysis of his commentary. We still remember your prior peevishness: Kachikwu dressing like a masquerade, Kachikwu’s rumoured favouring of family. Falaye Adeyinka Mr Obinna I do enjoy your contribution on this platform and I would like to agree with you to some extent that kola has been somewhat critical about Kachikwu since the early days of this Administration.But can you honestly say that the Minister has been consistence with his public pronouncement even in simple matters.For instance this is the same minister who once told us that the 3 refineries are working up 50 to 60% installed capacity and that he is looking at the data to determine how much our daily consumption actually is sometimes in 2015.We all know that the former statement is false and the answer to the latter question is still flying in the air! And so the issues Klola is raising today are very germane and on spot considering that we have charted this tainted and unprofitable path before (Obasojo/Yaaradua). I feel very strongly that there is a merit in this article (it should be depersonalized) and should be given national discuss.Attention! obinnna77 Somewhat? Accusing a man of corruption, without proof? That is the understatement of the week. When you go have gone adhominem​, in-lieu of substance , in the past, a discerning reader will also take your future postulations with a grain of salt. He has shown unfounded bias in regards to Kachikwu. He should subject ministers that talk about importing grass and delivering nonexistent wattage to talk about ‘consistency’. Manuel Tobby So what was your proof when you accuse Babangida and Obj of corruption?? ? Or is it only Biafrans that shouldn’t be accused without proofs? I am just asking for the rationale for your cherry picking of which of government officials to accuse of corruption. ifeanyi victor The south-south people will not see this looting of their land resources through this ungodly arrangement by north and tinubu clan and rise up against it. No bidding,no transparency,just foist oando on nigerians through this shoddy and illegal deal,so much for buhari and pastor osibanjo and apc transparency. North and south west have looted this country’s patrimony for so long. Thompson Iyeye We are truly in the era of the jackal, as far as the press and journalism is concerned in this country. For crying out loud, the press is the fourth estate of the realms, whose charge is to educate and inform the public on any issue including happenings in the executive, legislative and judicial arms of government, to ensure they function appropriately. There was indeed a time when the general public could depend on the press to discharge such functions creditably, but those days are long gone. What we have today is a docile and corrupt press with timid but greedy and dishonest journalists who are too glad to lie and mislead the public. Why would this journalist be asking what happened to transparency on this issue of the refineries, without doing the important job of investigating and telling the public what actually transpired. A good journalist through investigation would have been giving the details of what did happen and why, for instance, how the decisions were reached, individuals who took part from both sides of the negotiations, the value of the deal, how much money (if any) changed hands under the table, etc, etc. It is good to raise questions about government dealings, but not good enough without doing the investigative work to expose the guts of such deals. That is the stuff good journalism is made of, which keeps governments on their toes to make them more transparent and accountable, and accordingly less corrupt. Our journalists need to be more investigative. Simon Kolawole should please go back to the drawing board and truly tell us what has happened. We are otherwise, not impressed by this half measure. Jon West Simon Kolawole, I have always followed your shenanigans on Thisday and your Cable newspaper, but have never read anyone castigating you for promoting OandO, Dangote, Innosson and Glo. You have never promoted any of these companies, except perhaps Dangote and for obvious reasons. Anyway getting into the gist of this wishy washy article, who do you expect to extract the truth about the opacity in the operations of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria? Are you not a journalist, trained to penetrate political, economic and social fortresses in order to educate the people on the realities of the soceity? You have managed to make journalism in Nigeria a profession of griots, simple story tellers rehashing rumours and innuendos mixed with very little facts. This is not acceptable in the second decade of the third millennium of christendom in Nigeria. As for the refinery imbroglio, it is the usual Nigerian business model – Say a lot before thinking through the process and then do what you really wanted to do in the first place. NNPC invited Japan Gasoline Company(JGC), the contractors that built the Port Harcourt refinery, to rehabilitate and expand the refinery. The talks are still on-going, while the story of OandO and Agip is unfolding. This is the typical scammers mentality, the mentality of the Nigerian elite ,both in business and politics, and why nothing works. We have been talking about revamping the refineries for the past twenty years and nothing ever gets done, because every succeeding Government has officials that take their personal business interests more seriously than the national interest, hence Kachikwu’s dash to OandO, his great friend Wale Tinubu’s company, instead of the proven capability of JGC, the original contractors that delivered this relatively modern refinery in 1990. Bottom line, all this griot story-telling will not help matters and in any case Kachikwu, OandO and Agip have no interest in the efficient operations of the refineries. All these shenanigans are geared towards another scam, in which the Nigerian people will be made to pay the usual price of inefficieny and corruption. Men repeat history and then blame history for repeating itself. Tunde Liasu Guys, lets leave attacking Simon Kolawole out of this. Focus on the article he wrote and not on his personality. Can we look at this article dispassionately? Back to the matter, lack of transparency in government will continue until the country is structured to grow. What is our public policy in government procurement? What is our procedure in selling or privatizing public utility? These are the questions that we are supposed to ask. On the issue of Ango Abdullahi am surprised that OBJ is keeping quiet on this matter. This is the same matter he accused Chief Edwin Clerk about Ijaw agenda against GEJ. Is Ango not doing the same thing? It is only a fool that will say OBJ is not a ‘tribalist’. The same way Buhari is Kanuri-Fulani by origin, OBJ is Yoruba-Fulani. Nigeria needs a change! I concur that so far the best APC has offered is worse that the worst PDP has done. God help Nigeria. LagLon no the messenger is the message. kolawole is a discredited, biased and now blunt tool. why didnt he argue about the modular refinery program? funding process, how will it create peace? why hasnt he done a report called ‘JTF vs AMNESTY – the real price of war vs peace’? why hasnt he argued re the lack of accounts from NNPC since 2015? why hasnt he brought to light the amount of barrels – owned, pumped, traded (and now refined) by different ethnic groups? why hasnt he argued re the fact that only 6 states have made their budgets and accounts public since 2015? why hasnt he argued that aunty kemi should have made transparency a condition of any one of the 5 state bailouts since 2015? [ nlng, bonds, 2 x fed govt and paris club ] why cant we see pmbs medical bills? we heard about trumps travel costs in the us… SK sit down and shut the S**K up. please. Manuel Tobby Why not just begin your own online media outfit and show how to do it rightly! !! Anybody can criticize LagLon a critique of a criticism.. maybe kolawole should try and be minister of state for petroleum…. Don Franco Dear Simon, When will you stop riding procedural technicalities to a silly conclusion? The imperativeness of having the Port Harcourt refinery working in full capacity as expeditiously as practicable shouldn’t be sacrificed on the altar Procurement process and Transperency; this, after 20 years of dismal failure to have these refineries working optimally. If anything, you should have commended Kachikwu and Wale Tinubu for taking solid urgent steps to sort out arrangements for fixing a 20 year old problem that has set Nigeria back significantly. Further, the ENI involvement in the Malabu OML 245 saga is irrelevant, immaterial and of no consequence in the repair of this refinery; stop mixing up unrelated issues. Why isn’t the Certificateless One whom you helped to elect prosecuting the matter diligently; or didn’t you hear Kachikwu tell Segun Adeniyi that OML 245 will be renegotiated and returned to Shell and ENI? Your “Open Tender”, “Repeat Procurement” by Emeka Offor’s Chrome Group and ” Competitive Bidding” are cumulatively responsible for 20 wasted years; fixing these refineries with expeditious dispatch is all that Nigerians need now……without your personal animosity-tainted and grandiloquent op-eds. LagLon simon and kachi… you really hate him. oando – not good enough – not local content enough? why dont you ask the minister of petroleum? why he made that decision… rayden Simon, enjoy your “change”. You forgot to mention the sale of keystone bank bank to some northern investors using a very opaque bid proccess. We just woke up and heard it had been sold to some people, there was no information on the cost and how the winner was selected. During the previous administration, AMCON used a very open bid proccess to sell the other bridge banks( Mainstreet and enterprise), unfortunately the reverse was the case in this “change” administration. This administration is not even trying of correct the misdeeds of the past but are doing worse things than whatever wrong the past administration did. We would have been better off if they were even repeating the mistake of the past. RumuPHC The PH refinery deal is obviously another avenue to create rent for the boys. NNPC is in Joint Venture partnership with Agip/ Eni to drill oil in Nigeria. Interestingly the same NNPC now require a local company OANDO to be in partnership with Agip/Eni to fix a refinery owned by NNPC. The question is what value is OANDO going to add to the repair of the PH refinery and at what cost to the taxpayer? More importantly , why can’t NNPC enter into JV with Agip/Eni to fix PH refinery? The current trend of pairing local crony companies with multinationals by NNPC is the height of corruption and waste of public funds. Apparently, Ibe Kachikwu has discovered a more ingenious route to the public treasury.

Obviously one of the bigger steps forward in that area was the new Google Assistant that was unveiled last fall. In the beginning the app was only available to a very small minority, namely the Pixel users, but the company has expanded to other Android phones as well as their new smart speaker Google Home. Now, however, Google has gone way further and even brought it to the biggest competitor's flagship, the iPhone. Already Google Assistant has said to be in over 100 million devices but with the addition of iPhone and other phones Google aims capturing more of the enormous 2 billion smartphone market. Obviously Siri will still have the edge on iOS as it is the only assistant you can access straight from you home button but Google has created a widget which gets you to the Google Assistant pretty swiftly. But this is still only the tip of the iceberg according to Google. At Google I/O the company announced Google Assistant SDK which allows developers and manufacturers to bring Assistant with its AI capabilities to any kind of application and hardware whether it be a speaker, a coffee maker or a completely new type of device. Google also announced that it'll be expanding to new languages. By the end of the year Assistant will understand for example German, French, Italian, Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese.

It isn't easy, but here are a few pointers to help. Image: Fitbit Fortunately for those looking to consolidate their health and fitness data, most of these services have APIs, so there are options for pooling stats from different devices and apps. It's what Google and Apple have been trying to do with their own health and fitness portals, though with a limited amount of success so far. Using Google Fit Image: Google Google Fit now comes as standard on Nexus and Pixel devices, using the sensors packed into your phone (or Android Wear watch) to keep track of steps, sleep, and other measurements automatically. As you would expect from Google, it's slick and available on the web, but we're yet seeing much in the way of support from non-Google devices, even though Google Fit was first announced way back in summer 2014. Image: Screenshot There are a decent number of apps that work with Fit: Strava, Sleep As Android, and Runtastic, for example, so if you use these apps to track your running, walking, sleeping, and workouts then Google Fit is a decent option for consolidating everything in one place. What's missing is direct compatibility with the major wearable makers, the likes of Fitbit and Misfit, though Withings devices are supported. Compatible apps (here's a list) are usually connected from within each individual app's settings, so you'll need to dig around to find the option. From within the Google Fit app on Android, choose Settings from the menu then tap Apps connected to see what's piping data into Google Fit. Using Apple Health Image: Apple It's a similar story with Apple Health as it is for Google Fit — strong integration with Apple's own kit and support for some big-name apps, but more limited compatibility with actual devices you might be wearing on your body (unless it's the Apple Watch). Health is much broader in scope than Fit, acting as a repository for all of your medical data, not just the number laps your ran this morning. It also goes into greater depth when analysing your progress and making recommendations about where you can improve (like when to stop and take a breath). Image: Screenshot There's no easy way of checking which apps work with Apple Health and which don't, but as with Google Fit, Strava and Runtastic have joined the party, and Health links to apps from Misfit, Withings and Garmin too, so you can in theory use any of their wearables and pipe data through the default apps then on to Apple Health. Fitbit is the big hold-out. As with Google Fit, access is granted to Apple Health through the individual apps. Tap the Sources link on the front page of the Health app to see what you've linked up and adjust which variables each of the apps is allowed to edit. Using IFTTT Image: Screenshot We're unashamed fans of IFTTT (If This Then That), and the service plugs into just about every fitness tracking API out there including Fitbit, Jawbone, Withings, Misfit, Strava and more. This makes it even broader in scope than the offerings from Google and Apple. It's a shame then that IFTTT doesn't work with Google Fit or Apple Health directly. IFTTT isn't a repository for your data either, so once you've collected all the information from your various trackers and apps, you need to put it somewhere else. Fortunately, there are lots of options to pick from. You can pipe your statistics out to Evernote, for example, or a Google Drive spreadsheet, or OneNote, or even a blog post if you want the world to know what you're up to. A bit of trial and error might be required to get the data in the shape you need, but you've got plenty of scope for collecting and analysing feedback from multiple apps and devices. If you want to log your daily Fitbit stats to a Google Drive sheet, for example, choose Fitbit then Daily activity summary as your trigger, then Google Drive and Add row to a spreadsheet as your action. With a bit of touching up on the sheet itself, you can get a very decent-looking record of your exercise and sleep. Then you can import information from the spreadsheet into various apps. Using Exist We may well have saved the best until last. Exist draws in a ton of data from a range of fitness apps and devices, and will even go to the trouble of analysing it for you, letting you know which days you're most productive, and even how the weather affects your exercise. Exist works with Fitbit, Jawbone, Misfit, Withings, Google Fit, Apple Health (and the Apple Watch), Strava, Moves, Runkeeper and more besides. It can also pull in data from the likes of Last.fm, Spotify, Twitter, Dark Sky and RescueTime to try and chart your exercise against other factors like social media activity and how much music you're listening to. A subscription to Exist will set you back $US6 ($8) a month but there is a 30-day free trial available so you can work out whether it's for you. Once you've got yourself up and running, you can connect various services with just a few clicks. The online interface is a breeze to use and lets you dig into your stats in great detail, letting you chart different variables against each other. It also tries to pick out trends for you, letting you know everything from which music artist gets you exercising more to how your tweet patterns boost your step count.

This week: Chrome is a garbage browser, cars have gotten a lot safer and MP3s are a dying breed. Do Yourself A Favor And Ditch Chrome  It's difficult to tear yourself away from Google. Even if you don't use an Android phone, there's a good chance you use Google search, Gmail, Google Docs and the like. And also Chrome. And if you use Chrome, there's a good chance that you hate it, because Chrome is a massive resource hog that slows your computer down to a standstill just because you dared to have two YouTube videos open at once.  But it doesn't have to be like this. As Motherboard's Jason Koebler writes, there is a better way, and that way is Opera, a browser that blends the openness of Chrome (you can still have extensions!) with the not-eating-all-your-RAM part of other browsers. Half the Digg office switched to Opera this week and yeah, we're all happier.  [Motherboard] A Tortoise Is A Weird Pet One of the sad realities of getting a pet is that it will die at some point during your life. For all the joy they bring you during their lives, cats and dogs and the like just don't live as long as we do.  On the other end of the spectrum is a pet sulcata tortoise, which will almost certainly outlive you (though it probably won't come to your funeral). Hanya Yanagihara's story about the sulcata her parents adopted on impulse many years ago is a poignant reflection on death, family and shelled pets.  [New York Times] Cars Have Gotten A Lot Safer In The Last Couple Decades Okay, that shouldn't be a surprise. As with things like gas mileage and in-car tech (farewell, built-in mobile phones), car safety has improved by leaps and bounds since the '90s. To illustrate that change, the New Zealand Automobile Association decided "hey, let's just crash an old car and a new car together." So they did, and here's a snapshot of what a 2015 Toyota Corolla does to a 1998 Corolla:  &amp;lt;img src="http://static.digg.com/images/b833790a0a2148ce9e66b0a76f15dca9_6e8382ef263f4cf59896c0c63941394e_1_post.jpeg" alt="" /&amp;gt;   [Digg] The MP3 Is Dying Chances are you have a pretty solid library of MP3s on one of your devices. Chances are you also haven't been adding many new MP3s to those devices, as the rise of streaming services have replaced not only the need to download tracks, but the very format your music comes in as streaming services have eschewed MP3s.  At the end of the day, you won't notice any difference when you're listening, but if you're the kind of person who gets a little bit sentimental about their carefully curated MP3 library, the news that the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, which held the patent for the MP3, declined to renew the patent recently, effectively killing off the future. Combined with the recent fall of What.CD, it feels like the end of an era for music collectors.  [Quartz] Previously on What We Learned This Week  The Trees Are Dying And We'll Die Next, And Other Facts An Indestructible Bunker Sleeps In Colorado There Are Cocktails That Can Kill Dan Fallon is Head of Editorial at Digg.  UP AND OUT Turkey's Brilliant Tow Trucks Put The US To Shame 55 diggs Video Cars Video With Turkey's side-loading tow truck replacement, a car is loaded and gone in under a minute. 55 diggs Save Share Tweet 'nana Blacklist story Blacklist domain HOW TO BE AN ADULT How To Start Cleaning Your Place Right 20 diggs How To Be An Adult How-To Curious Digg Original Look, we know you're a clean person.

The animal has long been associated with climate change, but groups are trying to shift focus on to people. | AP World / Science & Health Time to ditch the polar bears? Climate change looks for a new image Thomson Reuters Foundation May 22, 2017 Article history Online: May 22, 2017 Last Modified: May 22, 2017 PRINT SHARE LONDON – What does climate change look like? For many people, the first — or perhaps only — image that comes to mind is of smokestacks, or polar bears perched on ice floes. “If you go to Google and click on climate change images, you have to go a long way before you hit many images of people,” says Adam Corner, research director at Climate Outreach, an Oxford-based think tank that aims to boost public engagement on climate change. But climate change already is affecting billions of people around the world, from farmers in Zimbabwe experimenting with new crops to battle drought to grandmothers in India who earn cash selling solar home lighting systems, or children in the United States coping with a longer allergy season. Getting more of those people-focused images into the media, into Nongovernmental organization campaigns and into other public communications could help more people identify with the problem, see the opportunities and understand the need for action, Corner said. “There’s nothing wrong with polar bears,” he said. “But they’re very distancing images. They identify climate change as something that happens far away where most people’s lives aren’t. They don’t do justice to the richness of the human experience of climate change.” In an effort to widen that narrow view, Corner’s organization has launched a new portal for climate change images. Inspired by Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In effort — which has worked to make sure online searches for images of women offer up more than just lingerie models — the Climate Visuals portal showcases a diverse range of climate change photographs drawn from stock photo agencies. Images so far, provided by early partners such as U.S.-based Aurora Photos, include U.S. homeowners installing attic insulation, women in Burkina Faso pumping scarce water, and European researchers studying the migration of grasses in the Alps. There are scientists monitoring glaciers too — but no polar bears. “The question is, if you make a change upstream in what’s available, can you politically influence the way people think about that issue?” Corner said. “Climate change has gotten stuck behind some iconic but limited images. We’re trying to kick-start a broader, more diverse visual language for it.” The not-for-profit effort is far from the first to try to reshape thinking about global warming and help people engage with what, for some, feels like an invisible and distant problem despite its clear and growing threat. But the project is one of the first to look at images, rather than language, something Corner finds surprising. “It’s very strange given we’re an increasingly visual culture,” he said. “The old adage about a picture painting a thousand words is really true — especially given attention spans.” Before launching the portal, Corner and colleagues conducted surveys in the United States, Britain and Germany to find out what people liked — and didn’t — about photographs of climate change. What they discovered is that viewers wanted to see people dealing with or taking action on climate change — though many said they’re tired of seeing climate change protesters. However, people don’t like being made to feel guilty about their personal choices — such as flying rather than taking the train, or eating steak rather than vegetables — so showing a family going on holiday on a plane as an example of what needs to change “can backfire,” Corner said. Photographs of traffic jams or industrial-scale food waste — both contributors to climate change — “people were more able to accept as a cause of climate change and relate to,” he said. Corner hopes the new portal will attract a range of contributors and users, including media, NGOs and campaign groups. Users will be able to click on the images on the portal and be taken directly back to the agencies that supplied the photos, with the agencies handling any sales. He is also working with World Press Photo to try to establish a new award category for climate change photographs in next year’s competition — another way to encourage thinking about a broader range of climate images beyond polar bears and smokestacks. “The question is, what would happen if you don’t get just that narrow range of images?” he asked. “Do people go clicking for polar bears? Or would they be happy to find a more diverse range of human stories — something they can relate to?” Photos Click to enlarge Keywords media, climate, U.N., Climate change, renewables, environment, Paris climate talks, Paris agreement Science & Health Strapped U.N. health agency doles out cash for first-class flights, five-star hotels for top brass NASA plans emergency space walk to replace failed ISS computer Speeding up sepsis care saves lives, study finds Norway to boost ‘doomsday’ seed vault’s defenses against climate change Mail the editor Error Report Republishing Commenting Policy The Japan Times ST The Japan Times on Sunday What's Trending Now The miserable case of unhappiness surging in Japan South Korean nuclear power plant accident would heavily taint western Japan: simulation Chaffetz resigns at career pinnacle after years in spotlight In one of his most difficult weeks as president, Trump looks increasingly isolated North Korea fires off medium-range missile in ‘challenge to the world’ ‘Gamified’ language app Duolingo finally adds Japanese ‘Another Kyoto’: Alex Kerr’s roving thoughts on Kyoto as it stands today Japan’s oldest human skeleton found in Okinawan cave Blogs Japan Pulse Yen for Living BACK TO TOP The Japan Times on Sunday The Japan Times ST Jobs Study in Japan JT for Women JT Bookclub Japanese School Directory Email Updates | Home Delivery RSS Twitter Facebook Newsletter News National World Business Asia Pacific Reference Columns Multimedia Opinion Editorials Commentary Reader Mail Cartoons Life Travel Digital Food & Drink Environment Style & Design Language Lifestyle People Columns Multimedia Community Voices Issues Our Lives Event Listings How-tos Columns Culture Film Music Art Stage Events Festivals Books TV Columns Multimedia Sports Baseball Soccer Basketball Sumo Rugby Figure Skating Tennis More Sports Columns Multimedia About us Contact us Privacy Policy Link Policy Reprints FAQs Support Press Sitemap Advertise The Japan Times LTD.

JUNG Yeon-Je / AFP It’s man vs machine this week as Google’s artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo faces the world’s top-ranked Go player in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI. China’s 19-year-old Ke Jie is given little chance in the three-game series beginning Tuesday in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen after AlphaGo stunned observers last year by trouncing South Korean grandmaster Lee Se-Dol four games to one. Lee’s loss in Seoul marked the first time a computer programme had beaten a top player in a full match in the 3,000-year-old Chinese board game, and has been hailed as a landmark event in the development of AI. AI has previously beaten humans in cerebral contests, starting with IBM’s Deep Blue defeating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, but AlphaGo’s win last year is considered the most significant win for AI yet. Go is considered perhaps the most complex game ever devised, with an incomputable number of move options that puts a premium on “intuition.” Proponents had considered it a bastion in which human thought would remain superior, at least for the foreseeable future. AlphaGo’s triumph fuelled hopes of a brave new world in which AI is applied not only to driverless cars or “smart homes”, but to helping mankind figure out some of the most complex scientific, technical, and medical problems. “AlphaGo’s successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered,” Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, said ahead of this week’s matches. AI’s ultimate goal is to create “general” or multi-purpose, rather than “narrow,” task-specific intelligence — something resembling human reasoning and the ability to learn. – Sci-fi nightmare? – But for some, it conjures sci-fi images of a future in which machines “wake up” and enslave humanity. Physicist Stephen Hawking is a leading voice for caution, warning in 2015 that computers may outsmart humans, “potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand.” Ke faces AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Ke is a brash prodigy who went pro at 11 years old, has been world number one for more than two years, and has described himself as a “pretentious prick”. After AlphaGo flattened Lee, Ke declared he would never lose to the machine. “Bring it on,” he said on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. But he has tempered his bravado since then. Ke was among many top Chinese players who were trounced in online contests in January by a mysterious adversary who reportedly won 60 straight victories. That opponent — cheekily calling itself “The Master” — was later revealed by DeepMind to have been an updated AlphaGo. “Even that was not AlphaGo’s best performance,” Gu Li, a past national champion, told Chinese state media last week. “It would be very hard for Ke to play against it, but then again, Ke has also been working extremely hard to change his methods in preparation. I hope he can play well.” Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid. The winner is the player who seals off the most territory. AlphaGo uses two sets of “deep neural networks” containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught — having played millions of games against itself after initial programming.

Google's Dave Burke: The first rule of Fuchsia is you don't talk about Fuchsia Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/19 11:32am PDTMay 19, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 235 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares324 Android OS News People have been buzzing about Google's Fuchsia project, an open source operating system that popped up on GitHub a few months ago. Some have even speculated that Fuchsia could be a replacement for Android down the road. Someone brought this up at the Android Fireside Chat, and VP of engineering for Android Dave Burke replied by basically not talking about Fuchsia. Here's the full transcript of Dave's answer from the above video. How do you spell Fuchsia? Fuchsia is a[n] early stage experimental project. We, you know, we actually have lots of cool early projects at Google. I think what's interesting here is its open source, so people can see it and comment on it. Like lots of early stage projects it's gonna probably pivot and morph. There's some really smart people on it, people we've worked with who are great. and so [it's] kind of exciting  to see what happens. But it's definitely a diff-- sort of independent project to android. and yeah, that's basically it. So, there's not much there, is there? Basically, we don't talk about Fuchsia. There's only a little useful information, which will hopefully calm everyone down. The gist seems to be that Fuchsia is still very early, and it's likely to change a lot before it ever gets close to being a real product. And importantly, it's independent from Android. In that respect, it was a little weird to ask the Android team about Fuchsia at all. Tags Android Fuchsia io17 io2017 video subscribe ...

Fuchsia is to Android as Singularity was to Windows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(operating_system) needa A little off subject. Any news of assistant, or a decent GNow version on Chrome? Or wait for Fuchsia? David Hyman I can't wait for assistant to come to Chrome. I also really hope they bring android apps to chrome too, not chrome OS but chrome proper. Those two things would be awesome Spencer Google released the Assistant SDK recently so someone could probably wrap the Assistant into a Chrome extension 🤔 David Hyman I am hoping someone actually does that! In fact that's what I tried to do, but my code skills are awful! boop Android apps aren't built into Chrome on Chromebooks, but in the underlying Linux implementation, parallel to Chrome. So I can't see that ever happening. David Hyman They are in a container though so maybe it's possible! I'm gonna hold my breath just in case! Timbets Title gives an impression that it is an actual quote Artem Russakovskii If we added quotes, maybe. But otherwise, it's an editorialized title with a clear movie reference. Bartek Juszczak It still seems like David Burke is making the reference David Especially when the same reference has been used before by Googlers themselves when talking about Android. No big deal in the title IMHO though. Kellijerickson Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sl206c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Teja Didn't you see Fight Club? Alvin I wouldn't say if I did. Peter Miller Yeah, but I, too, thought that the Google VP might had made a reference to fight club or at least said something like that he/Google won't talk about it or that its secret or whatever, but he simply answered that its an early project and that he and his team are not responsible for it. abc Yeah, but it was a very forgettable movie. Miku is Best Vocaloid Edwart Norton and Brad Pitt are the same guy. mola2alex Dammit, was going to watch it tonight, thanks a lot Artem Russakovskii That was a jerk thing to do. I deleted his comment. Zeek Hahahahahaha instinct I didn't think for a second that was really a quote. Mahdi Only time will tell... Stephen Sharp I'm glad they are independent. Would like to see Android continue using Linux as they are my two favorite things lol. Plus, Desktop Android + Wayland + Bash is all I ever need abqnm Ah, so like many Google projects, this one will also be schizophrenic. Nick Cannon What's the big deal? Fuchsia is a project that will be released in beta and Google will later kill off mola2alex Or have 5 of them existing all at once competing with each other with overlapping features and Target markets James Donut That's unlikely since they already invested alot of time and resources developing it. makapav Hangouts? Orkut? Google+? James Donut Orkut is replaced by Google+, Google+ is still maintained, as well as Hangouts h4rr4r Hangouts is living on borrowed time. It is losing sms support and duo and allo will replace it because they have more stickers. James Donut Nope, Hangouts will not fade away. Out of the 3 google message platform, it's the only one that has link to a google account (the other 2 relies on Mobile # as identification)... Btw, stickers can be easily added by google, it's not a big of a problem h4rr4r Tell that to Google. I keep trying to use Hangouts and they keep removing features. Stickers are dumb, I was mocking Google. Cheer Chunhao Nah not really, it will go pass the beta stage and be commercially available. Only 2 years later that they will silently abandon it. Lord Argyris Still looks like Vileplume. jm9843 "But it's definitely a diff-- sort of independent project to android." Translation: it's an independent project that will include binary compatibility with Android. And as such, may have the capacity to one day replace it. fahadayaz I heard exactly the same thing makapav He's basically scared of his job and has his fingers in his ears ;-) HiroRoshi Some tidbits about it here. IE, not Linux based. http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/Googles-New-Mobile-OS-Will-Have-a-Distinctly-Non-Linux-Hue-84535.html MeCampbell30 Meh, planning for the future of computing. Testing concepts, languages, systems, ect. Sounds prudent, I get it. Also sounds a long way off from being a tangible product. Hexlattice That response of his looks like the type Trump would give! Adam Margeson His is more cohesive than Trump's. Trump's speeches tend towards a 3rd grade literacy level. But, yeah. The denial and deflection was just as apparent. Hexlattice Couldn't have put it better myself. And glad you saw what I meant by my op James Donut Android is the Present.... Fuchsia is the Future Denholm Willmer fuchsiapolice.com instinct YOU PIVOT. Jay Just like how they're not talking about their messaging problem. Dustin Boyd Clickbaity title? Check! What we've seen so far has been buggy and incomplete, to the point that I wouldn't even call it an alpha release. Why respond to hype with info that may change at some point before a proper reasonably solid release? Perhaps we learned nothing from all the hype surrounding Windows Vista's release so many years ago (WinFS anyone?) abc The first rule is that Fuchisa is crap that will either never be released, or like other Google products released and subsequently abandoned. I will enjoy the fanboys masturbating to it though. b0b Google science project abandoned in .... 1 .... 2 .... 3. Paul M Power consumption is going to be a problem - we'll need 1.21 jiggawatts to get back to the fuchsia. Lord Ravenor I wonder if this will just wind up being the front-end system for Google Home/Google Home with a display? Roh_Mish Knowing google, they might very well keep both android and fuchsia development going on in parallel in future too. Or it might be an eventual replacement for Android Go, Chromecast, google home, android Auto, wear and other non phone ventures from google. Considering how locked down and API centric all these products are google can eventually move away from android based OS to fuchsia for them since almost no native code from app devs are run on these devices natively (well except for go) and if done right could mean these devices get Bette reithout breaking any of the apps on these devices. It's hard for Android since unless you are willing to bring everything from Android back to fuchsia you can't run every app on it and if you do then this project is meaningless. h20ray https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9e27f15b4ed7d193926bea66197042bced4e97d0b9a96192923ebfe77c18661.png ddevito Bullshit.

Climate change looks for a new image Laurie Goering | 2017-05-22 06:47:11.0 the polar bear has become an iconic symbol with regards to climate change. Image by: AFP PHOTO What does climate change look like? For many people, the first – or perhaps only – image that comes to mind is of smokestacks, or polar bears perched on ice floes. Save & Share Tweet Share Email Print “If you go to Google and click on climate change images, you have to go a long way before you hit many images of people,” says Adam Corner, research director at Climate Outreach, an Oxford-based thinktank that aims to boost public engagement on climate change. But climate change already is affecting billions of people around the world, from farmers in Zimbabwe experimenting with new crops to battle drought to grandmothers in India who earn cash selling solar home lighting systems, or children in the United States coping with a longer allergy season. Getting more of those people-focused images into the media, into NGO campaigns and into other public communications could help more people identify with the problem, see the opportunities and understand the need for action, Corner said. “There’s nothing wrong with polar bears,” he said. “But they’re very distancing images. They identify climate change as something that happens far away where most people’s lives aren’t. They don’t do justice to the richness of the human experience of climate change.” In an effort to widen that narrow view, Corner’s organisation has launched a new portal for climate change images. Inspired by Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In effort – which has worked to make sure online searches for images of women offer up more than just lingerie models – the Climate Visuals portal showcases a diverse range of climate change photographs drawn from stock photo agencies. Images so far, provided by early partners such as U.S.-based Aurora Photos, include U.S. homeowners installing attic insulation, women in Burkina Faso pumping scarce water, and European researchers studying the migration of grasses in the Alps. There are scientists monitoring glaciers too – but no polar bears. “The question is, if you make a change upstream in what’s available, can you politically influence the way people think about that issue?” Corner said. “Climate change has gotten stuck behind some iconic but limited images. We’re trying to kickstart a broader, more diverse visual language for it.” WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS The not-for-profit effort is far from the first to try to reshape thinking about global warming and help people engage with what, for some, feels like an invisible and distant problem despite its clear and growing threats. But the project is one of the first to look at images, rather than language, something Corner finds surprising. “It’s very strange given we’re an increasingly visual culture,” he said. “The old adage about a picture painting a thousand words is really true – especially given attention spans.” Before launching the portal, Corner and colleagues conducted surveys in the United States, Britain and Germany to find out what people liked – and didn’t – about photographs of climate change. What they discovered is that viewers wanted to see people dealing with or taking action on climate change – though many said they’re tired of seeing climate change protesters. However, people don’t like being made to feel guilty about their personal choices – such as flying rather than taking the train, or eating steak rather than vegetables – so showing a family going on holiday on a plane as an example of what needs to change “can backfire”, Corner said. Photographs of traffic jams or industrial-scale food waste – both contributors to climate change – “people were more able to accept as a cause of climate change and relate to”, he said. Corner hopes the new portal will attract a range of contributors and users, including media, NGOs and campaign groups. Users will be able to click on the images on the portal and be taken directly back to the agencies that supplied the photos, with the agencies handling any sales. He is also working with World Press Photo to try to establish a new award category for climate change photographs in next year’s competition – another way to encourage thinking about a broader range of climate images beyond polar bears and smokestacks. “The question is, what would happen if you don’t get just that narrow range of images?” he asked. “Do people go clicking for polar bears? Or would they be happy to find a more diverse range of human stories – something they can relate to?” - Reuters Share Tweet Share SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please send us an e-mail to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.

Toggle navigation Spoilers Exclusives Report Cards Watch TV Online Photo Galleries Mary Kills People Sundays 10:00 PM on A&E Follow Mary Kills People News Mary Kills People Reviews Mary Kills People Episode Guide Mary Kills People Quotes Mary Kills People Pictures × Follow Mary Kills People Mary Kills People Season 1 Finale Review: Riding the Chaos Diana Keng at May 21, 2017 11:59 pm. Comments The episode titles in this short series have held all sorts of crazy references which hint at deeper meanings. The final two are no exception. For example, Mary Kills People Season 1 Episode 5 is entitled "The Judas Cradle" which, on the surface, points at a theme of betrayal which totally works since Des goes ahead and wears a wire for the cops to get evidence on Mary. But Google the term and you get an eye-opening description of a horrific medieval torture device which Morgan, the patient of the week, has an encyclopedic knowledge of. So, betrayal AND torture. Awesome. Remember, this show is technically categorized as a dark comedy... Morgan isn't a comedic character but, as befits a character that actually recurs in half the episodes, he imparts a lot of wisdom while on screen. Some of it funny. Not a bad way to go, huh? Clean sheets, nice view, free hair products. I always pictured drowning in my own mucus in the ICU. This is better. Morgan Permalink: Not a bad way to go, huh? Clean sheets, nice view, free hair products. I always pictured... Some of it just wise. Morgan: When I was younger, I developed this obsession with medieval torture, like the Judas cradle... Mary: Why are you telling me this? Morgan: Because in a hundred years, they'll look back at now and say that the most popular form of torture was refusing to let people die. Dragging it out. Give people false hope, false relief, hook them up to machines. Something that should take months to kill them would take years. Those people? They're the bad guys. But you? You're one of the good ones. Permalink: Because in a hundred years, they'll look back at now and say that the most popular form of... Des always pulls his weight when it comes to injecting humor into a situation. High as a kite while Ben is fitting him with the wire, he dubs the cop "Benvolio" (a tip of the hat to the rather ineffectual peacemaker character in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet) and asks his plan for dealing with betraying Mary. Ben: My plan? I'm just... doing my job. Des: Throw yourself into the work. It's a good, solid plan. But it's the same things, really. The drugs, the law, it's all just an attempt to control the chaos. Ben: Ever think Mary's the one that creates the chaos? Des: Yeah. She's good at that. Permalink: Yeah. She's good at that. "The Judas Cradle" systematically tears all the show's pairings apart in dramatic, almost Shakespearean, fashion. Mary spots Des' relapse into drug use and it should've clued her in that all was not right with him. Des: I slipped up, okay? Mary: Not okay. When did this happen? Des: Today. I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. Mary: Why? What triggered it? Des: I'm an addict. I don't need a trigger. Everything's a trigger. Permalink: I'm an addict. I don't need a trigger. Everything's a trigger. Ultimately, he reveals his wire to Mary before she can incriminate herself but the betrayal still cuts her to the bone. After she revives him from his overdose, I wasn't surprised that she couldn't stop beating on him once he was out of the woods. Frank and Ben have a falling out, with Frank abandoning Ben to debrief the delay in the case with Judge Grant. Ben flashing his puppy dog eyes at him when he brings his peace offering search warrant is about as bromance-y as these guys ever get. Naomi and Jess have a full-out brawl and when Mary tries to reach out to her daughter, Jess bites her head off. I'm so sick of people talking about love when they have no idea what it means. You know, if you love somebody, you don't lie to them. You don't tell them you care about them when all you care about is yourself. Jess Permalink: I'm so sick of people talking about love when they have no idea what it means. You know, if... Even Louise and Kevin show a little crack in their happy little love nest when their daughters face discipline for their fight. What amazes me about the writing of this show is that all of this damage is calculated to lead elegantly into the second half of the finale, Mary Kills People Season 1 Episode 6, an episode cheerily entitled "Morning Glory." Of course, it turns out to be a dark metaphor. Mary: Remember when Mom had that problem with the morning glories? Nicole: Yeah, she was obsessed. I mean, they're beautiful but she said there's too much of them, too much beauty. Mary: Yeah, if you don't control them, they end up taking over the whole garden, strangling all the other plants. So you have two options. You can either pull them all out, start fresh, or you can ride the chaos. Permalink: Yeah, if you don't control them, they end up taking over the whole garden, strangling all the... Despite only appearing in two episodes, Mary's sister Nicole is probably my favorite character in the show. She not only rocks the devil-may-care attitude, her straight-shooting (no pun intended) clear-sightedness serves as the perfect complement to Mary's convoluted life. Their shared traumatic history and obvious affection for each other also highlights Mary's need for support and reassurance. Mary: As a doctor, I remain a member of society with a special obligation to all of my fellow human beings. Nicole: I don't think you have to be a doctor to have that obligation. Permalink: I don't think you have to be a doctor to have that obligation. When she proposes joining Team Death as the "receptionist," Mary may look skeptical but I am intrigued. It would not only put Nicole in more episodes in a potential Season 2 but I, for one, would love to see her interact with Des. Especially after his scenes with Annie in the finale. Des: Did I order you? Annie: No, Mary did. Permalink: No, Mary did. Des: I don't know if I'm hallucinating or dying, but either way, I like the view. Hello, Angel. Annie: It's Annie. And you look exactly like I thought you would. Des: Dashing. Annie: Depraved. Permalink: Depraved. There is much to admire in this tight, dramatic, ambitious series. It is anchored by Dhavernas' amazing performance but wouldn't be as appealing without Richard Short's versatile Des or Jay Ryan's nuanced and conflicted Ben. I still find Naomi and Louise painful as character obstacles but they are genuinely believable in their delusions and conceit. However, the gold star for awesome this season goes to Greg Bryk as Grady.  Mary: First, you have to find a good vein. Press up and down gently. This will expand the vein and make it easier to see. Grady: Just like people. You apply enough pressure and they show you what they really are. Permalink: Just like people. You apply enough pressure and they show you what they really are. In Grady, we were chilled by the perfectly combined visage of an accomplished criminal with the far more frightening intellect of an entrepreneurial genius.  Grady: How do we find our patients? Mary: They come to us. Grady: Well, we're going to have to do something about that, maybe hire some death dealers. Mary: I'm not soliciting death. Grady: You should be. Permalink: You should be. Knowing he has family that he treats with tenderness does nothing to diminish the sense of danger he embodies. The fact that Mary manages to outmaneuver him is far more impressive and satisfying than her ability to confuse and frustrate the police. She really is a monster-slayer at her core.

Who could have predicted that a show about assisted suicide could be so life-affirming? It really says something that the clients are the most at-peace characters we meet, culminating in the zen-guru Morgan, who would rather talk about Mary's pain in his last minutes alive. Mary: You know, the first time I did this, I was sixteen. It was with my mother. Morgan: She was sick? Mary: Yeah, she was depressed. She wanted to die more than anything. So each day, I'd come from school not know what I'd find. And my mother was good at a lot of things, but she was terrible at suicide. Permalink: Yeah, she was depressed.

We gotta wonder how Larissa's going to retaliate for Des throwing her out while he was strung out. And Mary? Brilliant and slightly compulsive about life and death. She could definitely carry this Dr. Death bit for a while longer. After all, it seems like it's the rush AND the calm that she's addicted to. I love funerals.

Memorial day, summer's big kick-off, is a week away and my nervous tick is back. For good reason. According to climatologist Mark Seeley Minnesota's statewide average rainfall is roughly 30 percent higher now than it was from 1921 to 1950. There's more water in the air, and it's coming down harder, especially spring and early summer months. 4 to 6 inches of rain swamped the area last week as a stalled trough of low pressure incubated 3 separate sloppy storms. A 'Sunshine Watch' has been issued for today. Please don't stare up at that bright, glowing mystery-orb, but try to enjoy 60s before a few instability thundershowers mushroom to life. Showers spill into Tuesday before improving weather midweek. A warming trend is still brewing - we should top 70F by late week. No more drenching, all-day rains in sight, but a swirl of chilly air aloft may set off weekend showers, especially up north. Far from perfect, but a definite improvement in the weather. More Than a Month's Worth of Rain in 7 Days. The coveted Golden Rain Gauge Award goes to South St. Paul, where 5.08" rain fell since last Monday, according to local observers. The MSP Airport in Richfield picked up a cool 4.18" of rain with 3.45" in St. Paul. Accumulated Rainfall. 24-hour Doppler radar rainfall estimates are available from NOAA's AHPS Precipitation Analysis site, along with a wealth of additional information. Excessive Rainfall Potential Today. NOAA WPC is outlining an area of southern Louisiana and Mississippi, including New Orleans and Gulfport, for extreme rains capable of sparking flash flooding today; a slight risk of urban flooding from Houston and Shreveport to Birmingham with a marginal risk for the Mid Atlantic region. Serious Wet Bias East of the Rockies. Check out 84-hour predicted rainfall amounts for the Gulf Coast and Southeastern USA; a streak of 3-6" amounts forecast from Houston and New Orleans to Atlanta and the Carolinas. The west coast gets a welcome break from puddles in the coming days. Loop: Tropicaltidbits.com. Sluggish Pattern Increases Flood Risk. When weather systems slow or stall bad things often result. A very slow-moving area of low pressure drags a line of heavy showers and T-storms across the southern USA today, another wave of moisture tracking over the same waterlogged counties by Wednesday. Meanwhile dry, sunny, increasingly warm weather is the rule over the western half of the USA. Stumbling Into Spring. It's been a rough 7 days, battling a veritable parade of storms. The pattern will slowly improve, although temperatures this week still trend below average. We get a glimpse of spring today before another (minor) relapse tomorrow. With a little luck and Divine Intervention we may rebound into the 70s by late week. Twin Cities ECMWF forecast: WeatherBell. 2-Week Weather Darts: Warmer! Confidence levels are low due to an ongoing tendency for the atmosphere over North America to get temporarily locked into a blocking pattern, where weather systems slow or even stall for days on end. GFS guidance hints at a hot ridge of high pressure building over the southern USA, expanding into the Plains and Midwest. We'll see. Summer Outlook: Here is the temperature (left) and precipitation outlook for June, July and August, courtesy of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. Much of the USA is forecast to experience a warmer-than-average summer, with the exception of the northern Rockies, northern Plains and Upper Mississippi River Valley, where temperatures are forecast to be close to average. A wet bias is predicted from the Rockies into the Plains for meteorological summer. Flooding Overview. Floodlist.com has continuous updates, broken out by continent, related to ongoing flooding episodes around the planet. Here's an excerpt of a new United Nations report highlighted on the site: "A recent report by the UN, “The Human Cost of Weather Related Disasters”, reveals that in the last 20 years, 157,000 people have died as a result of floods. The report also says that between 1995 and 2015, floods affected 2.3 billion people, which accounts for 56% of all those affected by weather-related disasters – considerably more than any other type of weather-related disaster..." Image credit: UNISDR / CRED. Scientists Look to Skies to Improve Tsunami Detection. Here's a snippet from an interesting NASA story: "A team of scientists from Sapienza University in Rome, Italy, and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, has developed a new approach to assist in the ongoing development of timely tsunami detection systems, based upon measurements of how tsunamis disturb a part of Earth’s atmosphere. The new approach, called Variometric Approach for Real-time Ionosphere Observation, or VARION, uses observations from GPS and other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to detect, in real time, disturbances in Earth’s ionosphere associated with a tsunami. The ionosphere is the layer of Earth’s atmosphere located from about 50 to 621 miles (80 to 1,000 kilometers) above Earth’s surface. It is ionized by solar and cosmic radiation and is best known for the aurora borealis (northern lights) and aurora australis (southern lights). When a tsunami forms and moves across the ocean, the crests and troughs of its waves compress and extend the air above them, creating motions in the atmosphere known as internal gravity waves..." Animation credit: "Animation of Oct. 27, 2012, Queen Charlotte Island tsunami as it crossed Hawaii. As the wave (dark blue/white lines approaching from the northeast) moved, it perturbed the atmosphere and changed the density of ionospheric electrons as reflected by navigation satellite signal changes (colored dots)."

The Atlantic explains our good collective fortune: "The next time someone says you’re living in a bubble, remind them that we all are. A pair of NASA space probes have detected an artificial bubble around Earth that forms when radio communications from the ground interact with high-energy radiation particles in space, the agency announced this week. The bubble forms a protective barrier around Earth, shielding the planet from potentially dangerous space weather, like solar flares and other ejections from the sun. Earth already has its own protective bubble, a magnetosphere stretched by powerful solar winds. The artificial bubble that NASA found is an accident, an unintended result of the interplay between human technology and nature..." (File image: NASA). Solar Employs More U.S. Workers Than Apple, Google and Facebook Combined. With a little perspective on renewables and employment here's a clip from ThinkProgress: "...As of 2016, California has just over 100,000 solar jobsâ—âa one-third increase over the previous year. The country added a record 50,000 solar jobs last year. The U.S. solar industry currently has more than 260,000 workers nationwide, according to The Solar Foundation. Their executive director, Andrea Luecke, points out that’s more workers than “Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon combined.” (As a point of clarification, Amazon has added jobs at a torrid pace in the last couple of years, so the 260,000 solar jobs is ‘only’ more than Apple, Google, and Facebook combined.)..."

NPR reports: "As part of President Trump's executive order to review "job-killing regulations," the Environmental Protection Agency last month asked for the public's input on what to streamline or cut. It held a series of open-mic meetings, and set up a website that has now received more than 28,000 comments, many of which urge the agency not to roll back environmental protections. "The EPA saves lives," wrote Benjamin Kraushaar, who described himself as a hydrologist, hunter and flyfisherman. He wrote that environmental regulations "ensure safe air and water for our future generations. This should not be even up for debate..."

The Worst Tourist Trap in Every State. I disagree with Business Insider's perspective on MOA, Mall of America in Minnesota. Otherwise the list looks fairly reasonable: "Maybe you're touring the US as a citizen out to see your homeland. Or maybe you're coming from afar to see what America has to offer. Either way, you probably want to make the most of your travels. While some tourist spots across the country have become legendary landmarks that everyone should see, others are just disappointing tourist traps.

Racing to Find Answers in the Ice. The New York Times has done a remarkable job, journalistically and visually, telling the story of what's happening in Antarctica - why not just coastal residents need to pay attention: "...Unraveling the answers, and gaining a better understanding of how Antarctica’s ice has waxed and waned in the past, may offer a rough guide to the changes that human-caused global warming could wreak in the future. Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades. The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked..." Map credit: "Red areas have lost significant amounts of ice since 2010." Climate Change Could Slash Staple Crops. CO2 is plant food? Yes, but too CO2 can ruin the recipe. Climate Central explains: "Climate change, and its impacts on extreme weather and temperature swings, is projected to reduce global production of corn, wheat, rice and soybeans by 23 percent in the 2050s, according to a new analysis. The study, which examined price and production of those four major crops from 1961 to 2013, also warns that by the 2030s output could be cut by 9 percent. The findings come as researchers and world leaders continue to warn that food security will become an increasingly difficult problem to tackle in the face of rising temperatures and weather extremes, combining with increasing populations, and volatile food prices. The negative impacts of climate change to farming were pretty much across the board in the new analysis. There were small production gains projected for Russia, Turkey and Ukraine in the 2030s, but by the 2050s, the models “are negative and more pronounced for all countries,” the researchers wrote in the study published this month in the journal Economics of Disasters and Climate Change..." Photo credit: Andrew Seaman/flickr Looming Floods, Threatened Cities. What if all those ("alarmist") scientists who specialize in this stuff turn out to be right? Here's an excerpt of Part 2 of The New York Times series on troubling changes in West Antarctica: "...In 2016, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University published a study, based on a computer analysis of Antarctica, that raised alarms worldwide. Incorporating recent advances in the understanding of how ice sheets might break apart, they found that both West Antarctica and some vulnerable parts of East Antarctica would go into an unstoppable collapse if the Earth continued to warm at a rapid pace. In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century. Dr. DeConto and Dr. Pollard do not claim that this is a certainty — they acknowledge that their analysis is still rough — but they argue that the possibility should be taken seriously..." The Arctic Doomsday Seed Vault Flooded. Thanks, Global Warming. Oh the irony. WIRED.com reports: "It was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world’s most precious seeds from any global disaster and ensure humanity’s food supply forever. But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel. The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. When it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide “failsafe” protection against “the challenge of natural or man-made disasters...” Why Do We Crave the Awful Futures of Apocalyptic Fiction? Aeon Videos has a memorable clip that's worth a look. A Future of More Extreme Floods, Brought To You By Climate Change. The Verge has a must-read story: "Extreme floods along the coastline may become much more common if sea levels continue to climb unchecked, new research says. Scientists estimate that as soon as 2030, a 4-inch sea level rise could double the frequency of severe flooding in many parts of the world, and increase it by as much as 25 times in the tropics. For the communities and ecosystems in the floodwaters’ path, the toll could be catastrophic. Right now, the global sea level is slowly but surely creeping upwards a fraction of an inch each year (0.118 to 0.157 inches per year to be exact). That doesn’t seem like much, but we’re already feeling the consequences of rising waters and eroding coastlines. Tides high enough to flood homes and infrastructure have become more common in some parts of the US like Florida — “turning it from a rare event into a recurrent and disruptive problem,” as a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put it earlier in 2017. In Louisiana, an entire community was driven from their homes on Isle de Jean Charles by rising seas..." Photo credit: "Flooding after Hurricane Katrina Photo by Lieut.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 22 May 2017 | MYT 8:30 AM Waymo’s next challenge: making driverless passengers feel safe Google's Waymo has gone from its Firefly prototype – a round, pint-sized vehicle that lacked a steering wheel and pedals – to tricked-out Pacifica minivans with all the usual controls that are now cruising around Phoenix. — AFP For years the Google coders and roboticists working on driverless cars have focused on making sure their creations could drive safely around California roads. Now, comes the next big test: getting regular civilians comfortable passing the wheel to a machine.   This month, Waymo, the mobility division created by Google parent Alphabet Inc, is starting a free, experimental service that will ferry people around Phoenix, Arizona. In preparation, Waymo has added a new suite of hardware and interior designs to its cars, revealed here for the first time, that will help the vehicles see their surroundings better and transmit that information to their occupants. The project's technology chief Dmitri Dolgov says the upgrades will ease passengers' concerns.  This is no small matter. While driverless cars have demonstrated a remarkable ability to navigate a complex world, every hiccup makes news. Google vehicles have been involved in several fender benders, and a Tesla Model S operating in Autopilot mode crashed into a semi-trailer, killing the owner.  The test will be watched closely by the tech and auto industries; a sour experience could turn off consumers, many of whom are skeptical of autonomous vehicles.  ”They don't trust that the technology is going to work one hundred percent of the time,” says Kathy Rizk, director of Global Automotive Consulting at J.D. Power, which has conducted surveys showing that while consumers are enthusiastic about driverless cars, they remain wary. “How do you put your trust in something that's going to take over the entire vehicle?"  Waymo originally planned to study human-robot interactions with its own concept car – a round, pint-sized vehicle codenamed Firefly that maxed out at 25 miles per hour and lacked a steering wheel and pedals. But California regulators insisted that the test vehicles must include controls so a human could take over. Waymo has since cut a deal with Fiat Chrysler to use tricked-out Pacifica minivans with all the usual controls that are now cruising around Phoenix. Waymo employees will keep watch in the driver's seat during the test.  Waymo believes regulators will eventually greenlight fully autonomous cars without the means for a human to take control. As a result, it may be necessary for the car to tell passengers what it's doing (suddenly slowing down, say) and explaining why (because a dog ran into the street). "How do people control the car? How do they tell the car where they want to go?” Dolgov asks rhetorically. "Some of those more subtle things – explaining those to the user, to the customer, to the passenger – is what we've been working on.”  Waymo has recruited several managers who worked on user design with popular Google products like Chrome and Android. This month, the company also hired a “user experience” researcher, who is supposed to help make passengers' time in the cars “intuitive, accessible, fun – and even magical.”  In a mockup viewed by Bloomberg, a special dashboard displayed nearby cars, pedestrians and buildings – an effort to give people confidence that the car is competent and in control. Some nearby cars were lit up, if they were relevant to the situation. Others were shown less prominently.  The message: Don't worry, the system sees the cars and understands which ones to track. Knowing buildings are there isn't critical, but showing them in outline helps orient passengers in the world. And when the vehicle yields to make a turn at a green light, the words "waiting for intersection to clear” appear. (The company stresses the design isn't final.)  Beyond keeping passengers feeling safe, there are practical issues. Because passengers will enter via the rear doors, Waymo's self-driving system brings the vehicles to a stop several feet forward from where traditional cars would pull up.  Since Waymo was spun out of Alphabet's X lab in December, it has thrown resources and talent at the hardware underpinning its autonomous vehicles. The division has hired aggressively, including several engineers from Terra Bella, the satellite division Google sold earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the situation. Waymo has also hired a number of reliability engineers from Tesla, a Waymo spokesman confirmed.  Earlier this year, the division unveiled a new suite of the sensors and chips that make autonomous cars possible. Not only are they cheaper, they also can generate a 360-degree view around the vehicle and see pedestrians and cars at far longer ranges. Newer cameras help the cars better navigate rain, a persistent challenge. Tiny wipers added to the spinning lidar atop the roof help mitigate a surprisingly routine problem: bird droppings. The new sensors can now see other vehicles and objects up to 200 yards away, Dolgov says.  Among the thorniest challenges are so-called edge cases, unusual situations that must be mastered by the technology, such as anticipating the sometimes unpredictable actions of human drivers. Waymo's latest hardware and software do a better job of figuring out how quickly cars are merging into freeway traffic, anticipating when someone is about to pull a U-Turn and navigating unprotected left turns – a particularly tricky manoeuvre because the car must figure out whether it has time to turn before oncoming traffic reaches the intersection.  Dolgov says these advances give him confidence Waymo is ready to ferry around people who don't work for Alphabet. So bullish is Waymo that it deliberately chose a depot in Phoenix that forces its minivans to turn left into oncoming traffic. Still, Dolgov knows better than to be overconfident. The company held a very limited trial of its vehicles in Phoenix for two months and quickly found itself grappling with dust storms.  “We're in the learning phase,” he says. Waymo may have a new avenue to expand road tests beyond Phoenix: the company cut a deal with Lyft Inc, which operates its ride-hailing service in at least 300 US cities.  Google has a history of rosy forecasts for fully self-driving cars, which some analysts say are still decades away. The company is also known for designing products with little idea of how they'll be received. Some became huge successes (Gmail); others didn't (Google Glass). Waymo is acutely aware of this history, which may explain why it has taken so long to get a driverless service up and running.  Competitive pressure may have forced its hand. Uber Technologies Inc, locked in a court battle over allegations its stole Waymo technology, has started its own self-driving tests in several cities. Tesla Inc is aggressively expanding the Autopilot feature across its model lineup. And, of course, major automakers are all hard at work on their own robot cars.   Waymo may have an edge over the traditional car companies. In J.D. Power focus groups, people said they believed tech firms – including Tesla – are more capable of perfecting the technology. Still, persuading people to actually get in one of these vehicles with no human fallback will take some effort.  "The reality is that the technology will be safer,” says Chris Rockwell, the founder of user research firm Lextant. “That doesn't necessarily get the passengers on board.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested French researchers find way to unlock WannaCry without ransom Piracy is theft The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Olympics - Australia closer to sports lottery for funding athletes Family forced to live under flyover Extra ’toppings’ for 35th anniversary advertisement Latest News Amazon sets sights on UK grocery with checkout-free trademark Google woos developers to catch Amazon in digital assistant race WannaCry attack is good business for cyber security firms Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges Amid industry pushback, China offers changes to cyber rules: sources Most Viewed in Tech French researchers find way to unlock WannaCry without ransom Uber’s new pricing model tests how much riders will stomach Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges Did your package get dumped in transit?

The country’s top agency countering cyber crimes has sought help from Facebook, Twitter and Google to stop extremists/hate mongers, who posted unwanted material against Pakistan, its military and Islam. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) is investigating some 41 people for posting anti-state content on different social media sites. “Some two dozen people suspected of publishing hate materials are in our custody — and it also includes some eight activists of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N),” a senior official of FIA disclosed on Sunday. “Social media activists who created fake online [Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.] accounts just to malign Pakistan, its institutions or to take revenge on other people or settle their political scores are to face tougher action through the FIA prosecutors,” added the official, who is part of FIA’s fresh drive against social media activists. The FIA investigators questioned some eight workers of PTI and PML-N who were accused of posting hate materials against Pakistan military, officials went on to say. Four people are being questioned by investigators who were allegedly posting blasphemous content on social media, they revealed. FIA team also quizzed three offenders who were accused of maligning chief justice of Pakistan and Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui of Islamabad High Court, they added. So far, seven out of these 21 individuals appeared before the FIA. They included Awais Khan, member of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) social media team, and Dr. Faisal Ranjha, member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). The entire proceedings were overseen by Direcor FIA Mazharul Haq Kakakhel. Sources informed Geo News that all the seven individuals, who appeared before the FIA officials, were allowed to go after upon completion of inquiry. The FIA has also summoned a journalist, Taha Siddiqui, regarding the issue. It has been learnt that Siddiqui plans to challenge the matter in a court of law. List of individuals served notices by the FIA. — Azaz Syed Also the FIA Islamabad office through Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) requested social networking sites to preserve data of some 1,001 social media accounts in past six months, FIA officials said. Offenders who create phoney profiles on Facebook and Twitter could face charges including terrorism, anti-state and harassment, they added. PTA also requested social media sites either to restrict or block around 400 accounts of Facebook and Twitter with around a dozen websites which were spreading unwanted content against the state, informed officials said. FIA teams received more than 11, 053 complaints in past 15 months, official data exclusively obtained by this correspondent revealed. Around 20, 180 complaints were sent to all regional offices of FIA by citizens from 2011 to April 2017, added the data. Over 4, 501 inquires were ordered by FIA investigators against over 20, 180 complaints during this period, official data continued to reveal. Around 1, 200 inquiries were filed in past sixteen months, read the data which further revealed that some 879 cases were filed by the investigators against the offenders. Some 240 social media activists also faced cases in past fifteen months, read the official data. Meanwhile, official sources confided to this correspondent that FIA is facing capacity problem as it could not handle piling pressure of rising numbers of complaints on daily basis. The agency also wanted some amendments in newly passed laws—Protection of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 as according to concerned officials it was difficult to quickly prosecute the offenders. The FIA wants more power under the PECA 2016 just to nip this uncontrolled evil, sources said under the new laws; around 210 cases have been filed in different special courts. Only one case was decided by a local court last week where it (court) awarded 18 months punishment with fine worth Rs200, 000 to a man who created a fake Facebook account of a girl in Lahore. About nature of cyber cases, FIA investigators said it is ranging from 'revenge pornography to blasphemous content'. Crackdown on social media activists, critics said, is creating a climate of fear and promoting self-censorship among other social media users which is a contrary to the principles of democracy. PTI's Shah Mahmood Qureshi who met his activists picked up by FIA said, “We stand by our [detained] activists and their families. Freedom of expression and democracy go hand-in-hand." As government earned harsh criticism on kicking off this move, Nighat Dad of Digital Rights Foundation opined: “Social media is a space for people, exercising their freedom of expression and access to opinion by sharing news, being critical to state actions etc., state needs to explain how they define criticism, defamation, hate speech and what law they are using to crack down on social media activists.” — additional reporting by Azaz Syed.

This is a fight about the most basic urban resource: space. And although concepts like gentrification and displacement have no clear definition—nor does everyone agree these processes are detrimental—there is a widespread concern among urbanists and activists that the rich will push out the poor, that conquest-by-condo is inevitable, and that, one by one, the world’s great cities will become yet another luxury good. Johannesburg Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week This city was long considered unsafe, a gangland best avoided in favor of Cape Town, but that has started to change in the inner core of the city known as J’burg. “Blocks that were once no-go zones now house art galleries, cafes and museums,” The Guardian reported late last year. “New businesses are opening. Neighborhoods such as Braamfontein and Maboneng are now seen as hubs of creativity and cool.” But that has meant that squatters, some 60,000 of whom live in about 100 or so abandoned or “hijacked” buildings, must find somewhere else to sleep. In a sad irony, those displaced from the city’s center, The Guardian writes, frequently “end up in the crowded townships the apartheid regime originally established to house black workers away from neighborhoods designated for whites, which occupy the prime locations.” San Francisco San Francisco was once known as a countercultural haven, a place where society’s unwanted could always find a home. The advent of Silicon Valley changed that, making the suburbs south of the city home to some of the most valuable companies in the world: Apple, Facebook, Google. Much of that wealth has flowed north, into San Francisco, to the displeasure of many locals. The “Google bus protests” of 2013, though nominally about the use of the city’s infrastructure, were in large part motivated by antipathy for the hoodie-wearing elite. The battle has been especially fierce in the Mission District, once a destitute Latino enclave identified by moneyed hipsters as ripe for colonization. In 2014, a video went viral showing Dropbox and Airbnb employees trying to wrest control of a soccer field, which they had paid to rent, from local youth who figured they had every right to play there. The outcry over the incident led San Francisco officials to discontinue such rentals. “It’s a victory for the Mission’s remaining Latino community,” Julia Carrie Wong wrote for the The New Yorker, “but there’s no guarantee that the privatization of San Francisco’s other public parks and facilities won’t continue apace.” Tokyo This city is a paradox, at once reverent of antiquity and aggressively modern. But many of the dark, narrow yokocho alleyways that hint at the city’s past are now being bulldozed, with apartment towers rising in their stead. The city is home to 25 percent of Japan’s population, and while Japan’s population is declining, Tokyo’s population is growing. With nearly 38 million people in its metropolitan area, it is the largest urban zone in the world. The Wall Street Journal reports that Japan’s capital added 110,000 residents in 2014. The yokocho alleys are victims of this inexorable growth, as well as of the preparations for the 2020 Olympics. So while such alleys are celebrated in every travel guide to the city, they are facing extinction. In older neighbors like Higashi-Nakano, the oldtimers are hardly fooled by what’s happening, or why. “The word ‘redevelopment’ sounds trendy,” one resident of that neighborhood told The Japan Times, speaking from the Ma-Yan bar located on a street called Moon Road. “But, in truth, the agency just wants this property to make money off of it.” Berlin In the first few years after the Berlin Wall came down, the city retained a kind of thrillingly bifurcated identity, part Western metropolis, part Soviet backwater where artists could live as they might in Bratislava—without having to live in Bratislava. That is no longer the case, however, as the hollowed-out courtyards of East Berlin fall victim to development of both the commercial and residential variety. Nowhere has the battle been more forcefully waged than in Kreuzberg, which sits practically in the middle of the sprawling city. For years, it served as a refuge for artists and the kinds of young people who didn’t dream of careers at Deutsche Bank. That has started to change, to many locals’ consternation. They have tried to fight back, by staging demonstrations that have attracted international notice. “People are finally starting to defend themselves,” one activist told The New York Times earlier this year.   Pittsburgh  A few years ago, any suggestion that this former steel town was being gentrified would have been laughed at—and readily welcomed. But that would have been before Google set up offices in the Bakery Square section of the city, before Uber and other tech companies turned the seemingly faded Rust Belt metropolis into a hub of experimentation in robotics and autonomous vehicles. Much as Stanford is the brain center of Silicon Valley, so is Carnegie Mellon the talent hub for Pittsburgh, which some have started to call Silicon Valley East. Pittsburgh has also been called one of the best cities in the country to eat, and while any culinary tour of that city must include a calorie-packed Primanti Brothers sandwich, the kinds of restaurants being touted by the national press (Vandal, Whitfield) are unaffordable for many longtime residents, signaling clearly to some that the city’s cultural and economic ascendancy will inevitably lead some behind. Those fears were confirmed in the East Liberty neighborhood, an African-American enclave where the Penn Plaza housing development was demolished. Slated to replace it is that universal symbol of gentrification: a Whole Foods.

This grants you live streaming access to most Australian free-to-air channels - including ABC, SBS, Seven, Nine and Ten - without the need for an aerial. Here's how to get the app working on your TV. Freeview FV is a free digital television app that delivers free-to-air channels over the internet. The app includes live streaming from all the free-to-air networks, access to all catch-up TV, the ability to browse and search free-to-air TV content, an inbuilt TV guide and a recommendations system that works similar to Netflix. Available channels include: ABC, SBS, Seven, Channel 9, TEN, ONE, Eleven ABC2/ABC KIDS, ABC ME, ABC News 24, SBS VICELAND, Food Network, NITV, 7TWO, 7Mate, 7Flix, Racing.com, 9Gem, 9Go! and 9Life. The app is available for iOS and Android devices. When it launched back in 2016, one of the chief criticisms aimed at the Freeview FV app was its lack of Chromecast support. This forced users to connect their device to a TV via a cable or a third-party workaround. Thankfully, this has been addressed in the latest update. The advantages of this are pretty obvious: it means you can watch free-to-air channels on your TV even if there's no aerial available. It also means no more crappy reception from indoor "rabbit ears" - just plug in your Chromecast and start watching. Here's what you'll need to get Freeview FV up and running on your TV via Chromecast: A smartphone or tablet with the latest Freeview FV and Google Home apps installed. (Older versions should update automatically.) A smart TV with built in Chromecast functionality or a Chromecast dongle. (The latter should work with any HDMI-enabled TV - prices start at around $60.) An internet connection. Setting up Freeview FV on your TV is no different to other Chromecast apps - simply fire up the channel on your device and then click the Chromecast icon at the top of the screen. The video will then be instantly transferred to your TV. (You can find additional setup tips here.) Naturally, it pays to use a home Wi-Fi connection while viewing Freeview FV content: otherwise you'll chew through your mobile data allowance pretty quickly and could be slugged with excess charges. Freeview FV: How To Watch TV On Your Phone Or Tablet For Free Have you ever wished you could watch your favourite TV shows with a single click of your smartphone or tablet? That's the concept behind Freeview's new FV app for iOS and Android. It grants live streaming access to over 16 free-to-air channels, including ABC, SBS, Seven, Channel 9 and Ten. Here's what you need to know about how Livestream works and how to set Livestream up so you can watch TV on your smartphone or tablet for free.

[Update: Emoji suggestions] Gboard 6.1 includes revamped voice typing, GIF suggestions, and even Google Doodles Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/09 8:39am PDTMar 9, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/03/09 8:40am PST Google has published a blog post talking about the Gboard 6.1 update, and mentions that the keyboard now supports emoji suggestions in addition to GIFs. Here's an example: We already wrote about Gboard 6.1 Beta, which adds a few notable features including Google Translate integration and an improved theme picker. Since that post, we've received tips about more changes in the update, so let's take a look at a few of them. Before this update, tapping on the microphone button in Gboard would cause the keyboard itself to collapse and show a voice typing interface in its place. This animation is rather slow if you have a lower-end phone, and if you want to go back to the keyboard, you have to close the voice typing popup and wait for the keyboard to re-appear. In Gboard 6.1, tapping the microphone button keeps the full keyboard open, only showing an indicator for voice typing on the top right. Not only does this work better than the old solution, but you can simply tap anywhere on the keyboard to stop voice input. Next up is GIF suggestions. When Google Keyboard was updated to Gboard last year, one of the new major features was the ability to insert GIFs (only with compatible apps). Gboard 6.1 takes that to another level by adding GIF results to the suggestions bar. I don't think I would use this much, but I'm sure at least some of you are psyched about it.    Finally, Gboard 6.1 actually shows the current Google Doodle when you open the built-in search. I guess that's neat? I'll let you be the judge: Gboard 6.1 is still in beta, which means you have to either join the beta program on the Play Store or download the APK from APKMirror to try it out. You can also wait for the update to leave beta, which I'm sure isn't too far off. Thanks: Zachary, The Clashster Update 1: 2017/03/09 8:40am PST Google has published a blog post talking about the Gboard 6.1 update, and mentions that the keyboard now supports emoji suggestions in addition to GIFs.

And yeah, I still miss those. It's just much quicker than reaching up to wherever the text field may be to do those operations. There's one thing I miss even more tho, the capitalization shortcuts... Swiping off keyboard got upper case and towards the apostrophe and such rather than just assuming the keyboard will guess I want it (often guesses wrong in either direction, like wasn't instead of want). GBoard seems smoother overall tho, but that may be simply because I'm comparing it to Swype on the Nexus 5... I was getting some baaad memory leaks there that seemed to cause the keyboard to slide out from under me or take forever to load up. My name is…. What i hate about gboard is that if you press backspace after an autocorrection ,it reverts to what you originally typed. Is there a fix for that? Matt If you hit space first, then backspace I believe that works My name is…. You have to hit space twice then, because hitting it only once just autocorrects. But twice just adds a period. Kirk But, what are you trying to accomplish? It sounds like you want to keep the auto-correct. So, why are you hitting backspace then? akshay7394 Oops forgot to put a comma the— Oh. Welp, thanks for undoing autocorrect, Google. Impulse_Vigil I actually like that... Bryan Breguet No shit, that's one of the best features... dhamp2g I like that bc thats usually what I meant to type Impulse_Vigil Yeah that's entirely the point of backspace cancelling out auto correct... Not sure why else you would backspace in most instances. Allan Still no suggestions in all fields. It would be nice not to have to write out my whole email like other keyboards nawa Make a shortcut "mymail" in personal dictionary and assign your email to it. If you swipe it, it'll pop up in any text field, even if there's no suggestion box. kapilmachi Exactly what I do. I just assign couple of letters to get my mail IDs, address, phone number etc Allan Tried it but can't seem to get it working. Any other suggestions? Drunk Squirrel Holy shit that works! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/956006ce12dd7e0fe58022072fd48911f18b65725ab761219ad41d658f54efe2.gif Genevajthomas Google is paying 97$ per hour!

I did this by using yy as yahoo email shortcut and gg as gmail shortcut. Mark Lottes agreed.....surprised this isn't already in there. johnny Agreed. Also does anyone know how to turn off the gif suggestions? Many words I type can't be followed with two !! Or two ?? without some stupid gif suggestion panel taking up half my phone's screen. Childish and dumb. If I want to to use a gif I'll look it up. Please help me get the gif suggestions out of the super useful panel above the keyboard!! WilliamTell13 "The beta program for this app is currently full." Ben Godfrey Highly infuriating, isn't it? I was a few days behind on news when I read about the beta and missed the chance to join. I could just install the beta APK, but it wouldn't be worth the trouble. xD Cakefish All you have to do is go to APK Mirror and press download, then tap on the download notification. F4LL0U7 Does anyone else have an issue with Gboard and physical Bluetooth keyboards? I have a Nexus 9 and the official BT keyboard. Before Gboard, pressing the left Alt key would open the emoji gallery, and the right Alt key would open the number/symbol keyboard. Ever since Gboard came out, both Alt keys open the numbers/symbols. There's no way to open the emoji gallery when using a physical keyboard. Am I missing something? Lucas de Eiroz ™ huh... it's happening here too. tim242 Bloat bloat bloat, and slow as molasses. Chris What keyboard do you use? I used to use SwiftKey but it was unbearable slow, and Google Keyboard was so much faster. I don't find the Keyboard to be super slow or anything but I'm just curious what you use. tim242 I used the Google Keyboard for years. I loved it. But then they decided to bloat it into GBoard. It was slower. My biggest issue is that it leaves a big blank bar above the keyboard, when word suggestions are disabled. I just can't use it. I now use the Samsung Keyboard. kapilmachi Then just be happy with it. Gboard is getting for the good. Atoqir I use Samsung Keyboard too. Works great and had contact and multi language integration since ages. Denis you're the only person who says it's "slow" in every thread. there's something wrong with your phone, it's lightning fast. tim242 You might want to see the play store reviews. Corey Kinard So plenty of people have slow phones, your point? What are you using? tim242 An S7, which ran Google Keyboard lightning fast. Lars Jeppesen Strange, my S7E (Exynos) runs it purrrfectly... Atoqir Reading that comment the last Galaxy device you used is probably an S4 or S5. Samsung has cut a lot of the bloat and included some great features. SpadeX Call me when they remove their browser, email and calendar apps. Atoqir Those apps are great. I prefer S-Planner over Google Calendar. Much more clear month view and no overuse of colors and pointless images. Also no OEM ships phones without contact, phone, mail, calendar, camera and music apps. These are the basics. Not everyone wants an empty phone with just an app store icon. I do think they should allow us to remove everything we don't use instead of disabling it. SpadeX That wasn't my point. I agree that no one wants an empty phone but no one wants duplicates either. The Google main apps are installed by default and cannot be removed. Therefore, as you said it's better to at least give us the option to uninstall the Samsung apps instead of forcing us to have them installed. And your preference to the Samsung apps is nothing but a subjective opinion. I prefer the Google apps instead due to their ease of use, simplicity, and minimal design. And to make it a little bit clearer, I'd also prefer to give the option to uninstall the Google apps. Gmail, I'm looking at you... Atoqir I agree completely. Everything should be able to be removed. Now my disabled list of apps is full of google apps. Only thing i use is maps, play services and play store. Everyone has it preference. Suicide_Note I'll bedand you the doodle. That's a silly inclusion with the keyboard. However, revamped voice typing and suggestions is hardly bloat. Also, Gboard runs fast and smooth as silk on my Pixel. Swiftkey, on the other hand, is a lagfest. David Hyman I wish gboard would let me check the links it is showing to make sure that it's what I want to drop lolote No mic. And keyboard at same Time. Only the mic like a older version, android 7.1 Jeffrey Tschiltsch Yeah me too and I confirmed I have 6.1 (6.1.71.149620197). Emoji prediction occasionally works (pizza and cake, but I typed cake three times and it only predicted the emoji twice, weird; and a lot of stuff that Swiftkey predicts doesn't happen at all with Gboard unless you go to the emoji search). kapilmachi Now it provides suggestion even for Google search through Google app. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cb16b23dd499c4af6b05c2d9c01563b19fb43a99124f256211ebb2fd5b653acc.png Julian C. Taborda That's strange, mine isn't doing that! kapilmachi Try using swipe gesture instead of typing each letter Mohamed Sahl what is swipe gesture ? Artem Russakovskii You need 6.14+ AND it only works with swiping. Why, Google, why!? kalehv I got all that and I am swiping, still no suggestions while in Google bar. Can't think it's related but does it not work for Pixel launcher? AndroidUser00110001 Go into the keyboard settings, toggle each setting off and then toggle back on. Some of the suggestions weren't working for me and after toggling off/on each setting it started working. Mohamed Sahl same here, please let me know if you knew how to swipe gesture :) Chocanto You, sir, got a great background image kapilmachi Thank you. It's my mom and her mom. Goyam Jain I also got emoji prediction with Gboard 6.1 anyone else got it? kapilmachi Yes. Started working a week back. Goyam Jain Has Android Police staff covered it? kapilmachi Not explicitly. Discussed in the comments section of last APs post about Gboard. Necronos That's the only thing I've been waiting for to switch from Swiftkey Goyam Jain It's not as good as SwiftKey yet but it is there and is improving everyday. Yesterday I didn't emoji for police. But today 👮 Jay Yep, it seemed to have gone live for me within the last 24-48 hours. kalehv I do not have it yet. I am on latest beta. kalehv NVM, I have it. Goyam Jain There's a switch in Gboard preferences named "Show emoji preferences" check your phone for that Impulse_Vigil Voice input window should've been like that (keyboard still present) years ago IMO. Adam Margeson Years ago, phones, even flagships, were much slower and had far less RAM and storage available. Keeping that much code, both the app storage and running memory was a much bigger hit to performance than it is now. Impulse_Vigil Somehow I doubt this would've been an issue on something like a Nexus 5, not even sure what all the extra code you're alluding to is... The whole animation to transform the keyboard into the voice prompt and then have the animated mic surely takes up more resources than just leaving the keyboard up and simply dumping the voice service if the keyboard is touched. If anything this is probably much more efficient... Even on a fast phone it's faster to go between both now simply because the UI element is condensed to one button vs one button plus a plane plus several animations. Adam Margeson The code I'm referring to is the Speech Recognition itself. The old version of the keyboard literally didn't directly include the speech recognition - that was a separate keyboard that it would bring up when prompted and then switch back to GBoard when it was done. You can try it yourself - when in a text prompt, swap keyboards to "Google voice typing" and the same voice interface will come up. Keeping the speech recognition code in memory every time the keyboard comes up would have dragged performance way down on those older devices - even something like the Nexus 5. The animation part of it is only a small piece - rather intensive, resource wise, for that brief transition period, but a far smaller sacrifice than keeping "bloat" in the background. Impulse_Vigil You're making it a coding/resource issue when it's really a UI issue. Whether it swaps entire keyboards (arguably less effective use of memory) or not, they can still represent it graphically by a mic button without extra animations and panes (just swap out whatever service in background once someone taps elsewhere if necessary). Sides, the stock keyboard has had a mic button for a good while anyway even pre GBoard. Just because it's there doesn't mean it has to be kept in memory... #ChopTheLettuce Voice input sucked so much the old way, I never used it. Could do without the doodle... Grey The problem with modern Google Doodles is I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE. It used to be something simple, like Arbor Day. Hey, trees, I know this. Now... what the hell is that one for? JG International Women's Day (March 8th) apparently. There's 8 doodles all together to click through. At least on the web. Tapping or swiping on the keyboard doodle does a search for "International Women's Day"... You only get one doodle that way apparently, even though it looks like a play button is in the middle of it... Cakefish Google wants to teach you things, tap on it and you'll find out (it's International Women's Day by the way). #ChopTheLettuce You know, this is kind of weird, a beta of a Google app actually getting new features. Frisi What's weirder: it's not server side. fijisiv If it helps you feel better, development will be discontinued in a year and replaced by "Gkey" which will include 50% of the features of Gboard. _jack_ the beta is full :O Just I really would be more "psyched about" the ability to get rid of this whole gif mess. Oh and of the millions of "emojis" too. Suicide_Note I'm glad they have support for GIFs and emojis in Gboard. I use both dozens of times throughout the day. Since you don't like them, maybe check out Chrooma or Swiftkey? Just um no? i have a pixel for a reason. Suicide_Note I have a Pixel XL, though I'm not understanding what that has to do with the Google keyboard. Siddharth Look closely even the Google icon animates which is present in the auto-predict bar... vaibhav singhavi All I want from Gboard to work on chrome browser and other apps where no suggestion pop out Тарас Мукин Ah, if only it supported custom themes... Changing background is not enough! SpadeX How about the fact that it can't send images directly to the chat like the iOS version..I'm sick and tired of Google giving priority to iOS users first. givitumibeybi why no news on cia exploits? AdamH Also, sometimes the G logo is animated after sending text or opening keyboard. It's very rare, I've seen it only twice. Suicide_Note Yep. It happens only about 30% of the time i open the keyboard. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Seems like Gboard Team is on fire 🔥 One new feature update after another. Good job! But it would be great if all Google Teams put that much effort in their products.. Bewear It would be great if they actually put that much effort without dumping the whole app in the end. cbn4forums When will they include Emoji suggestions? I think they are used more frequently than GIF. Suicide_Note They do include them. If i type the word pizza, for example, the middle suggestion is the pizza emoji. cbn4forums Good to know...thanks. I just installed the beta from the APK mirror and I didn't see it. Voice Input looked the same as the old version. I must be doing something wrong! dhamp2g it doesn't work in hangouts....it never has been able to accept gif suggestions. The pic shows it working in hagouts...whats the trick to making that happen?????????? dhamp2g does anyone get gif suggestions in pookietookie Would REALLY like a cut/copy/paste button for this keyboard. Even if it's on one of the secondary keyboard panels. Jason Nice! i asked google to put punctuation around the voice typing button (as the only punctuation not spelled out was "period" and "question mark" so hopefully this is their answer to quickly adding exclamation points and commas. if not though i think people should start asking for quick punctuation keys that dont stop voice typing. dimm0k ever since the name change from Google Keyboard to Gboard I've found autocorrection and suggestions to be shoddy at best. half the time it autocorrects to the wrong word and then the suggestions it offers is nowhere near the word I was looking for. wtf? iCON Yup, got really bad after updating to GBoard. It even inserts some words when I tap backspace. Highly infurating. Captain_Invisible Yeah, it has been really broken ever since the change. drcaveman You can't join the beta program the Beta is full. belac77 I've never seen a Beta program on Google Play display that message before, but it's true! Guess I won't be testing out new Gboard features. Oh well, maybe having a beta version of a keyboard isn't a good idea anyway, since it's one of the most-used parts of the mobile experience. verboze the voice input improvement is really nice! It took too many taps before to switch back and forth between text and voice input. I love that they've streamlined this! Borgman Beta is full :( dhamp2g @corbin Davenport How did you get gif suggestion to work in hangouts? It says its not supported when I try gif search! Sruly J Are you trying a Hangouts conversation, or SMS? Because it only works in a chat. V2THE1 Gif's have never worked for me. wickets still no auto space after a comma! yikes larry Bru [971] The gif thing is AWESOME ! Loco Mole Still no EMOJI SUGGESTION. Don't understand the logic of having GIF suggestion without having emoji suggestion, given the latter is more prevalent and ubiquitous. And I wish they stick to the correct two letter language ISO 639 language code. It's a bit amateurish that they don't, again given that this is so, so prevalent in L9N and I18N. (for example, the code Indonesian is not IN, but ID). Francesco Lorenzet still no adaptive theme Scorpiax7 The update is out guys.... ClearlyYoureWrong Updated to the one on APKMirror and I still have the got-old-real-fast transition to full voice keyboard. Anything I need to do. I've hated that since the day it was available back on honeycomb or whenever. Artem Russakovskii It seems to be a server-side rollout, so just wait. V2THE1 The GIF feature is still in beta. Lol. It works to some contacts and not to others even though I'm using the same apps to send and they are receiving my the same apps. alaimo HATE! Voice-generated text feature now repeats my words/phrases multiple times, very annoying. Hope it's rectified with 6.2 version SOON Dr P Fenderson I don't know that this is a 6.1 issue. I haven't upgraded/updated to the new version, but this bug has recently appeared for some fields regardless. alaimo The annoying multiplying effect was short-lived as my phone rec'd a GBoard update overnight... the issue has been resolved. Yay, Google! umer farooq Emoji suggestions are here. Is it heaven? Green Now Google needs to add third-party add-ons for Gboard, and then it'll be great. Oh wait, Apple will sue google for copying them Dr P Fenderson I just updated from APKMirror, but I definitely am not seeing the changed voice typing interface. I still get the old version, where it switches to a full-panel look. Artem Russakovskii It's a server-side rollout. Dr P Fenderson Ah! Good to know. Thanks for the update, Artem. Sir_Brizz WTF the beta is full.... Paul Kennedy Does anyone have a list of the emoji suggestions? I've got a few by trial and error but it would be handy to get all the words. Groosha Damn, those suggestions are so correct! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/64817c4135e3e1f33396e0eb45de5354e462010c4d060eace053786fc07392aa.jpg Knight I installed this last update (same version and​ file) and for some reason the gif suggestions works on my Nexus 9 but not on my N6P. Can anybody suggest a solution?

Climate change looks for a new image By Thomson Reuters Foundation/Laurie Goering  &nbspMay 22, 2017 | 09:30 am GMT+7 Photo by Wim Van Passel/WWF What does climate change look like? For many people, the first – or perhaps only – image that comes to mind is of smokestacks, or polarbears perched on ice floes. “If you go to Google and click on climate change images, you have to go a long way before you hit many images of people,” says Adam Corner, research director at Climate Outreach, an Oxford-based thinktank that aims to boost public engagement on climate change. But climate change already is affecting billions of people around the world, from farmers in Zimbabwe experimenting with new crops to battle drought to grandmothers in India who earn cash selling solar home lighting systems, or children in the United States coping with a longer allergy season. Getting more of those people-focused images into the media, into NGO campaigns and into other public communications could help more people identify with the problem, see the opportunities and understand the need for action, Corner said. “There’s nothing wrong with polar bears,” he said. “But they’re very distancing images. They identify climate change as something that happens far away where most people’s lives aren’t. They don’t do justice to the richness of the human experience of climate change.” In an effort to widen that narrow view, Corner’s organisation has launched a new portal for climate change images. Inspired by Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In effort – which has worked to make sure online searches for images of women offer up more than just lingerie models – the Climate Visuals portal showcases a diverse range of climate change photographs drawn from stock photo agencies. Images so far, provided by early partners such as U.S.-based Aurora Photos, include U.S. homeowners installing attic insulation, women in Burkina Faso pumping scarce water, and European researchers studying the migration of grasses in the Alps. There are scientists monitoring glaciers too – but no polar bears. “The question is, if you make a change upstream in what’s available, can you politically influence the way people think about that issue?” Corner said. “Climate change has gotten stuck behind some iconic but limited images. We’re trying to kickstart a broader, more diverse visual language for it.” Photo by WWF. Worth a thousand words The not-for-profit effort is far from the first to try to reshape thinking about global warming and help people engage with what, for some, feels like an invisible and distant problem despite its clear and growing threats. But the project is one of the first to look at images, rather than language, something Corner finds surprising. “It’s very strange given we’re an increasingly visual culture,” he said. “The old adage about a picture painting a thousand words is really true – especially given attention spans.” Before launching the portal, Corner and colleagues conducted surveys in the United States, Britain and Germany to find out what people liked – and didn’t – about photographs of climate change. What they discovered is that viewers wanted to see people dealing with or taking action on climate change – though many said they’re tired of seeing climate change protesters. However, people don’t like being made to feel guilty about their personal choices – such as flying rather than taking the train, or eating steak rather than vegetables – so showing a family going on holiday on a plane as an example of what needs to change “can backfire”, Corner said. Photographs of traffic jams or industrial-scale food waste – both contributors to climate change – “people were more able to accept as a cause of climate change and relate to”, he said. Corner hopes the new portal will attract a range of contributors and users, including media, NGOs and campaign groups. Users will be able to click on the images on the portal and be taken directly back to the agencies that supplied the photos, with the agencies handling any sales. He is also working with World Press Photo to try to establish a new award category for climate change photographs in next year’s competition – another way to encourage thinking about a broader range of climate images beyond polar bears and smokestacks. “The question is, what would happen if you don’t get just that narrow range of images?” he asked. “Do people go clicking for polar bears? Or would they be happy to find a more diverse range of human stories – something they can relate to?”  Related News: The world's unhappiest polar bear?

While the costumed masses are putting the finishing touches on their get-ups, race organizers, police and the neighbors who live along the 7.46 mile route, from its start at Mission and Main streets in the Financial District to its finish at the Great Highway along Ocean Beach, are bracing for the usual deal. Dozens of city streets and Muni lines will be closed or altered to make way for the heaving throngs of shameless humanity, some running in just their shoes. Thanks in part to an official ban on alcohol and heightened security along the course, following a period around 2010 when “it got unsafe,” the last couple of years have been generally better behaved, said Chris Holmes, director of operations for Bay to Breakers. There will be more than 1,000 portable toilets lining the raceway, more than the New York City Marathon, for those tempted to urinate in public or on someone’s porch, Holmes said. The ongoing ban on bags that are not clear will stay in effect, a security precaution that started after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. “We want Bay to Breakers to be an event that everyone can come out to and have fun,” Holmes said, adding that the entrance fee to the race for participants 17 or younger is half-price in an effort to attract more families. Police on bicycles, golf carts and park rangers on ATVS will be on the lookout. Officers, some undercover, will also set up shop outside liquor stores — looking for both cashiers who are serving to the clearly intoxicated and runners who pop open a cold one seconds after stumbling onto the street. Officers will step up patrols of house parties that dot the Panhandle, Rueca said, noting the death of 28-year-old San Francisco resident David Hamzeh in 2013, who had been drinking at a party on Fell Street across from the Panhandle when he fell from a four-story apartment building’s roof. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: CBS 5 SF KPIX - 3 days ago< > Embed Friday Morning Forecast With Roberta Gonzales 02:54 Expect temperatures to continue heating up in the Bay Area on Friday, with highs approaching 80 by the bay, highs in the 90s inland.

One study suggests that poorer populations are being left out of digital data used for disease surveillance Elaine Nsoesie, The Conversation Skip to Comments Topics: disease surveillance, food poisoning, Google, Poverty, public health, socioeconomic status, The Conversation, Yelp, Social News, Media News (Credit: Kostenko Maxim via Shutterstock) This article was originally published on The Conversation. Think of the last time you had food poisoning. Did you tweet about it? Did you Google your symptoms? Or did you write an angry review on Yelp? Every day, people use the internet to seek and share health information. This opens up exciting new ways for scientists to study the health of a population, an approach known as digital epidemiology. But, in most cases, we do not know much about the individuals who post this information. We don’t know if the data include people from poor households, or how the data break down according to race, gender or age group. We also don’t know if they include those who are most vulnerable to the disease of interest in a particular study. Before we can start addressing disparities in digital data, we need to show that these disparities exist. Our study of more than one million Yelp reviews suggests that poorer populations are being left out of digital data used for disease surveillance. Data detectives Since digital data are generated in nearly real time, they can be a valuable way for researchers to track disease trends. For example, health departments in New York, Las Vegas and Chicago can now choose which restaurants to inspect by tracking reports of food poisoning on Twitter and Yelp. They also use the data to monitor disease outbreaks from contaminated food. However, the evidence suggests that these cutting-edge techniques overlook a major segment of the population. For example, in 2015, a research team led by biologist Samuel Scarpino brought together digital and nondigital data sources to model influenza – from Google searches to ILINet, a nondigital government project that monitors outpatient health care providers. ILINet might not cover lower socioeconomic populations, Scarpino told me. Adding social media data into his model didn’t seem to mitigate these disparities in representation. The team discovered they could accurately predict influenza hospitalizations for wealthier zip codes in the U.S., but not for poorer ones. This suggests that other public health surveillance systems powered by digital data likely suffer from the same problems. We wanted to see if similar patterns were reflected in data from Yelp.com, and to better understand what factors are most correlated with U.S. restaurant reviews. Our study Yelp provided us with more than 1.5 million reviews posted between 2004 and 2014 for food service businesses in Oregon, Massachusetts and Georgia. We looked at how the volume of reviews changed with seasons and day of the week. We also studied the most recent data, from June 2013 through May 2014, to assess food poisoning reporting at the county level. Since the Yelp data included both good and bad reviews, we built a machine learning algorithm to extract the bad reviews that talked about food poisoning. Next, we estimated the correlation between reports of food poisoning and various socioeconomic factors, demographic factors and the geographic concentration of food service establishments. We discovered that traits typically associated with higher socioeconomic status (such as high percentage of residents with higher education or higher income) were consistently positively correlated with reports of food poisoning. For example, the strength of the relationship between the percentage of residents with a bachelor’s degree and reporting of foodborne illness was 0.44, where 0 indicates no association and 1 is a perfect association. Meanwhile, people who were unemployed, didn’t have health insurance or were living in poverty were less likely to report food poisoning from restaurants. Our models suggested that counties with a high concentration of restaurants and people with bachelor degrees were most likely to report food poisoning on Yelp. However, this does not imply that these counties have higher incidences of foodborne illness or outbreaks. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that populations of low socioeconomic status have higher incidences of foodborne illness. The disparities in reporting of illness could be explained by differences in access to the internet or health and computer literacy. Dealing with disparities If we do not monitor populations of low socioeconomic status, then we cannot adequately address their public health concerns. While these studies hint at disparities in digital data, we need additional demographic data to properly quantify the representation of different populations. Knowing the demographic and socioeconomic breakdown of the data can inform us about its biases toward particular groups. That can shape how we design research studies and public health surveillance systems. It can also help us to develop methods to address data limitations, so that we do not continue perpetuating existing health disparities due to poverty, educational inequalities and other factors.

The current Google Pixel/Pixel XL will support Project Treble, possibly meaning longer support Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 8:03pm PDTMay 18, 2017 89 Plus 1 on G+ 220 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares383 Android O Android OS Google News Pixel Pixel XL There are a few reasons why your phone or tablet stops getting Android updates. One reason could be that the maker of your device's processor (e.g. Qualcomm or MediaTek) never updated the drivers for newer versions of Android. This is why no phones or tablets with the Snapdragon 800/801 chip ever officially received Android 7.0 Nougat, including the Nexus 5. Google announced Project Treble a week ago, which aims to solve this particular problem by separating the Android OS from the 'Vendor interface' (the part with all the low-level drivers and binary blobs). The vendor interface under Project Treble is also designed to be forwards-compatible, meaning that it shouldn't have to be updated for every Android update, in theory. During one of today's Android Fireside Chats at Google I/O, Dave Burke (VP of engineering for Android) revealed that the current Google Pixel and Pixel XL will work with Project Treble. Normally, only phones that ship with Android O will work with Treble, but the Pixel will be an exception. I'm excited to see if this will give the Pixel a longer support period than previous Nexus devices. Google has only promised two years of software updates (and three years of security patches) for the Pixel. Project Treble could extend that even further - we'll have to wait and see.

Paige Turner I'am freelancing on the web, finishing fundamental responsibilities which only demands from you computer system or laptop and additionally internet access and I couldn't be delightful... Six months have surpassed since i initiated this and also i profited until now altogether 36,000 dollars... Basically i earn profits around $80 each hour and work for three to 4 h every day.And great point about this job is that you can actually choose when to work by yourself as well as for how long and you receive money by the end of every week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Bala nice to read , but probably in the next 2 years the device will look outdated on all specs Corbin Davenport The point isn't to keep the Pixel competitive against other phones as time goes on, the point is to continue supporting the people that paid $650+ for it. JohnyNoLegs I feel like those same people will just upgrade in 12 or 24 months anyway. We are talking about one of the most expensive phones on the market. Stephen J Huh? We're talking about a phone comparable in price to every other flagship in 2016.. "One of the most expensive"? Maybe, but it is in good company. JohnyNoLegs Well in AUS it's the most expensive android phone you can buy right now. EowynCarter Well, I spent some bucks on my Nexus 6. But, paying for an expensive phone, one of my expectation is that it last a few years indeed. zepy3 Of course there will be the group of people that always want the latest phone. Though, if the iPhone market is any example there is a diverse group of people that hold off upgrading for up to 3 generations (6 versions of phones including the S models). Some purposely never purchase the latest generation too. There's a large group of people, myself included that would never ever spend $650, let alone the $800+ for the XL.Only to have it lose software support after 2 years, offering 3 years of security patches is all well and good but Treble being a real thing, longer life for the devices themselves is the only way I can ever justify staying with "Made By Google" phones. JohnyNoLegs Logically if you don't want to spend that much then you should get op3t or mi6 etc. Would be far better if you are pushing your budget/allowance just to think you are getting Google's best. Pixel is an over priced HTC 10 with less features. Trust me, I owned both. HTCthe1st&Best I had both too and I like Htc but even at best Htc will get you system updates in 90 of release which pixels get from day one and beta previews. I bought the pixel xl 128 because Htc never made big enough screens and the fast updates. I will still get the Htc U11 because I like the quality phones that Htc makes. I may even buy the pixel xl 2 when it comes out this fall but yes I would be buying it for the updates mostly and hopefully pixel xl 2 comes with 5.7 or 5.9 screen. If they get the screen to phone ratio better on pixel xl 2 they could get it to 5.9 and not be very much bigger than pixel xl at all. Hopefully they get pixel xl 2 to 5.9, but at least Htc U11 comes with an sd card slot which google could give a rats azz that people want an sd card slot they would rather make you pay $100 more for 128 gb storage that you wouldnt need if it had an sd card slot which with one 32 gb's is fine. JohnyNoLegs Updates are stupid on the Pixel anyway, all they do is break and fix things. Never had this many issues with a phone. I think the Nexus/Pixel line is a beta test, like a test to see if people would spend that much money on an android phone. Perhaps their next phone will be not only be better, but they might get out of the developer mindset and make stable, quality software. HTCthe1st&Best Let me guess you would spend that for a samsung though lol and be an operating system or two behind of the pixels and pay the same price. People that pay the same price for phones that do not get monthly security updates and that thost same phones take 8 months or more to get system updates that pixels already got are just fools buying nothing more than a name or should I say sheep... Knowledgeborn Allah They could hypothetically go hand-in-hand. If Google supports the devices for longer periods of time, it could (in theory, of course) help with long-term resale value. In many circles, people are more than willing to spend $400 on an iPhone 6, even though its specs are clearly outdated, as the device came out almost 3 years ago. If other Android OEMs don't implement that kind of support (and they most likely won't) while Google does, the Pixel could become a commodity that everybody flocks to, especially within the Android space. Bala Im using a pixel xl as of now , the device will run great for years even with nougat installed. Sure i would welcome the move for continued support but I highly doubt any android oem would do that ,for the sake of their business EowynCarter Unless they do, Apple will be the one to get my money. dcdttu Not to my parents! JohnyNoLegs And they will only accept the very latest builds from android, anything less and it's unusable! Dmitry Stepanushkin My dad uses Pentium 3 600 with 256MB RAM and Windows 2000, and it's the fastest PC in the world for him. So, yes :). JohnyNoLegs So he's running windows 10 by that logic then right? Dmitry Stepanushkin For his hardware Windows 2000 is so much better than Windows 10. If You look at numbers, it must be 200 times better at least :-). JG Well of course... 2000 > 10 and the bigger the number, the better, everyone knows that. That's why, for example, 1080p is considerably better than 4k, because both the number and letter are higher. JohnyNoLegs So no issue having no Android updates is the point EowynCarter There's more than just latest version. There are also bug fixes and security patch. JohnyNoLegs Security patches come to nearly all handsets anyway. Bug fixes are due to Pixel/nexus bugs anyay. raazman That's not the point. Nathan J So are many PCs that are still getting updates. Hell I spent something like $300 on my graphics card, and it's not even VR ready. Them's the breaks. But I still get updates from Microsoft. Imagine if computers cut you off after 18-24 months and then told you to buy a new one to be protected from malware and other threats. Never mind the whole Windows 7 crowd, who insist on using 8-year-old system software... Rod As a Nexus 5 user, I doubt that. Dre LOL sure. Duder12 Aww look. We have a Samsung user! Shelly-Man Vol 2 I hope so! Google love doing plot twists though. Dmitry Stepanushkin Yes, for example, they may create new OS and drop Android support :-). Eric Walker Every OS comes to an end Lateef Alabi-Oki 5 years of OS and security updates. That should be Google's commitment to its users and the environment. thebum232323 I concur Nathan J Damned right. If they want to charge iPhone prices, they should match iPhone support. Five years of updates and everyone gets the update regardless of how the manufacturer feels about your carrier or country. Really — and especially with Android, which is more open than the iPhone — your smartphone should just be a dumb piece of hardware that gets updates like your PC. For years and years and it's all the same. And I think that's what Project Treble is going for, if I understand the diagram correctly. If so, it's how I've been saying Android should work since 2012 or so. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... But, even if Google does keep the Pixel phones up-to-date for 5 years or so, a major issue they need to work out is availability. Keeping devices updated for longer doesn't help if people can't actually buy the phones. If they can fix both of those issues, then they'd have a winner. Nathan J It's HTC, they can only make so many. Nexus has always had supply issues though. I think if, next year, we get a Galaxy Pixel, Samsung will have no problems meeting the demand. Stock Android on Samsung hardware, now that Samsung has dug its way out of 2010 hardware design, is the dream. Lucas de Eiroz ™ Samsung would never make phones for Google again. They already are on the top of Android phones sales. Making efforts to produce phones in large scale to another brand wouldn't be a smart move. Nathan J Sadly, you're probably right... which is partly why I said it's the dream phone and not the most likely one. HTC has Pixel for two years, though, that's old news. Nobody wants LG making them as Android bloggers are allowed to talk about LG's bootloops (but, oddly, not HTC's). That pretty much leaves Motorola, as far as OEMs that make phones for the US market (as well as everywhere else). Jeff Coover They don't need to go with a company that makes phones for the US market. The used Huawei for the Nexus and there's no reason they can't do so again. I think it would actually be a good idea. Google could benefit by getting decent price on manufacturing from a company known to have quality manufacturing but that is not running on fumes. Huawei, or other company, would then make money from a new market without it cutting into their own sales. HTCthe1st&Best The Huawei 6p's were nothing but problems many were replaced with pixels by google under warranty. Huawei makes cheap junk which is why they never sell many phones here in the USA. HTCthe1st&Best But google wouldnt want exploding phones any way so neither would want samsung making any pixel line as samsung has enough problems with their own products like their note and washers that can cause physical damages to people using them. Jay Nexus didn't have an issue like this. Not for this long. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... The old Nexus devices may have had limited availability for a couple weeks at most, whereas the Pixel XL has been out of stock almost since its release last year! And, as crazy as it may sound, I saw more people in the wild with the Nexus 6P and Nexus 6 than I've ever seen with the Pixel. I have literally never seen anybody else with a Pixel or Pixel XL, and that makes their constant status of being "out of stock" more confusing than ever. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Keith Stefanec I got a Pixel XL 3 days after they came out! Knowledgeborn Allah That's great news, lol... What does that have to do with availability? If you can purchase a phone within its first week of release, that doesn't say much. I was able to get the Pixel XL when it first came out too. Try ordering one now. Let me know what you find out... 🙄 dogerRodger I skipped the 6 because it wasn't available until at least March Knowledgeborn Allah The Nexus 6? Seriously? 🙄 I find that a little hard to believe, primarily because the Nexus 6 was sold all over the place, not just on the Google Store website. I used to see quite a few people buying them well after their release from Best Buy and T-Mobile. They were displayed in almost every Sprint and AT&T store I went into. In fact, the Nexus 6 was one of the most 'available' Nexus devices ever made. I don't know where you were trying to buy yours, but you could've easily gotten one inside a store. dogerRodger The stores never had the color / size combo I wanted and the Google store was out of stock for months. By the time it was available where I could get what I wanted I'd decided to pass. Knowledgeborn Allah Are you talking about the Nexus 6, or are you referencing a different Nexus device? The Nexus 6 only had one size and, if I remember correctly, it only had two colors: blue and white. The first (and only) Nexus phones to ship at the same time in alternate colors and size configurations were the Nexus 5x and 6p, and I don't think those were sold in any retail stores other than Best Buy... In any case, you're talking about preferences, not availability. The Nexus 6 was stocked so highly when it launched that, when Google realized it wasn't selling in huge quantities, they cut the price almost in half after only a few months! By around the 6 month mark, it was already selling on Amazon for around $200. The carriers kept selling it long after that, though. Sites like eBay were practically giving it away for free. That's not the case with the Pixel at all. Google is still selling it for around $700, and it's not available in any carrier's stores other than Verizon - and, last time I checked, they're out of stock there too! Some people complained about having to wait 6 to 8 weeks to get the iPhone 7 and 7+ after they launched and sold out. People have literally been waiting for the Pixel to get back in stock for months before they can even order it. The details regarding that and whatever Nexus 6 delays there may have been aren't even comparable. dogerRodger the nexus 6 was white/blue. obviously the phone was one physical size but came in 32/64 for storage. stores that i visited only stocked blue/32. the white/64 i wanted wasn't available until at least march. that is a problem with availability, not preference. that phone sold out almost instantly and google promised new stock weekly just so people like me wouldn't give up. Jeff Coover I think that is because Nexus was mostly for developers and enthusiasts which make up a relatively small portion of people buying phones. So it was intentionally made in small amounts so they weren't left with a bunch of extra and it sold out fast as a result. I figure the enthusiasts are the type of people to want to get the phone as quick as possible but demand would drop sharply and make it easier to stock. Nathan J Not this bad, no. We're what, six months on now? This is basically unacceptable. But the Nexus phones all or at least recent ones had early supply issues that shook out after a month or so. Same with the iPhone, actually. Jeff Coover Google is the one designing the hardware though so the Samsung hardware would not come into play. Google is just using HTC as a manufacturer but they have little to no input on the design. That was one of the major differences between the Nexus line, where the hardware was designed by the partner company and the software by Google, and the Pixel line, where the hardware and software are done by Google. So really Samsung might be able to supply to the demand better than HTC but the device would be virtually the same no matter who Google pays to build it. needa I don't think Samsung is an ODM. Even if they are, we will see a Google design. TheScientists That's a nice dream, but we'll never see a Galaxy Pixel. Sammy doesn't need to do that, nor would they want to at this point. roberto.elena If Apple wants to charge Pixel prices, they should match Android features. Nathan J Touché! I could say that Apple has the dedicated fan base and they don't have to, but they're sitting real pretty at about 15% market share. I remember in the '90s, they had about about half that of the PC market and they were comfortable with that. Still, maybe Apple should look for writing on the wall. Like the app gap. They used to lord this over Android when it was in their favor. Now that it's not, we only hear crickets... You may have heard that Apple apps are generally better. This is barely a half truth. While iOS does have certain advantages (fewer devices and resolutions, mostly), I see a lot of abandoned apps in the App Store. Apps I used on both platforms have more features on Android. Like Telegram and OurGroceries — the latter of which I've paid for three times now — can't even figure out a dark theme on iOS whole they're present on Android. And as you may know, there's a sort of voluntary ignorance with iOS users to just kind of pretend everything is okay. Kind of like Android users who pretend Android flagships are comparable in performance to the latest iPhone. A lot of complacent printer on both sides. One reason I got an iPhone. I wanted to know firsthand and stop assuming. 13 months with iOS and I definitely prefer Android, I just don't have much faith in many Android phones. Eric Walker I think one thing he was trying to point out is that even though apple supports their phones for 5 years, after a few years the updates start to lack features that the newer phones are getting. I have first hand experience with this in the case of my iPad mini 1 which technically got iOS 9, but none of the improvements like the new notes app and a lot more things. abc lol. So Apple needs to come out with more malware, less updates, and shit support roberto.elena Enjoy your walled garden, where big brother Apple tells you what you can do with your device. h4rr4r The problem with this is Google and ARM. ARM lacks any sort of PCI like thing, so the kernel needs to know about hardware before boot. Google is a problem because they will not just force drivers into mainline. If Android used GPLed drivers none of this would be a problem. Michael Oghia Kudos to you for considering the enviornment miscfiles That would be great. The only downside is non replaceable batteries. Have you used a phone with a five year old battery? Lateef Alabi-Oki The oldest the Android device I use is the Nexus 7 2013. On Lineage OS, running Nougat, it flies. No battery issues either. As with anything in life, if you don't abuse your devices, and you take good care of them, they reciprocate the favor. miscfiles I've got a Nexus 7 2013 which is also fine, but I can't say I've used it much. My well used Nexus 5 battery was a shadow of its former self before it was two years old, and barely lasted me until lunchtime by 32 months - at which point I replaced it with a Pixel. I wouldn't say I "abused" it, just that I used it quite a lot. zepy3 It's almost as if phones suddenly were supported by software for 5 years, manufactures would have to innovate the hardware to last the same... *magic* :P miscfiles Maybe the long lasting battery tech I keep reading about will actually come to market one day. For five years of service, it'd need to handle 1,500+ charge cycles. Current batteries can lose ~20% in charge after only 400 cycles, and drop off even more steeply after that. A replaceable battery would be easier with today's technology. Lateef Alabi-Oki That's why I keep my devices always plugged when I'm not using them. My Nexus 7 sits on a wireless charging pad permanently when I'm not using it. I can still get a day's worth of battery life out of it. pfmiller My Nexus 10 on the other hand gets about 5 minutes of battery life when I unplug it. h4rr4r The only reason they lose capacity that fast is because of unusually high power density and poor battery management. If the phone never charged above 80% and never allowed a discharge below 20%, you hide it from the user by moving the 0% and 100% locations the batteries would last a lot longer. Phones are so thin these days you could add 1mm back and gain enough battery to implement that change. MJ You mean don't use your devices? I have a Nexus 7 2013 and still have a Nexus 5 which are both in mint condition. I am not a heavy phone user and the tablet is just used to watch Netflix on my TV. Neither battery is worth much now... My Pixel XL can last 2x as long as both together. I would say 5 years of security updates makes sense but 3 years of OS updates is more than enough. One who doesn't care to update their phone probably doesn't car about OS updates. Lateef Alabi-Oki Come on! It's not fair to compare the battery life of a device built on a 14nm chip to one built on a 28nm or larger chip. Of course, your Pixel has better battery life than your Nexus 5. Its SoC is twice as efficient. And I use my Nexus 7 every day. It's my living room companion. Although it is placed permanently on a wireless charging pad when I'm not using it. I don't know why there's an artificial delineation between security updates and OS updates. This is software. An update is an update. In fact, I hate the idea of yearly OS updates. It's mostly marketing BS. I wish Google would switch to a rolling 6-week updates for Android like they do with Chrome, Chrome OS and their Google services. I'd take small incremental regular updates every month over large OS dumps every year. This leads to much more stable and less disruptive releases for users, and fine-tunes Google's continuous integration and deployment process (which is a bloody joke on Android). MJ Thanks for writing a whole essay confirming new phones have better hardware which is why people upgrade. LOL If my Nexus 5 was getting the same battery life when I first bought it that won't be a problem (for me). Batteries deteriorate over time. You must know this... Yearly OS updates are marketing BS? Huh? Six week rolling updates would be more stable? Some Linux distributions do rolling updates so users can have the latest packages and they are NOT known to be stable and break things. Let's adopt this for a consumer product! #facepalm It would be so awesome for Android OEMs to be 10 updates behind now. I can't believe you compared development cycles of apps to operating systems. What's so disruptive when a new Android update comes out? Lateef Alabi-Oki Oh, I thought people upgraded their hardware just for the "lols". Here comes another essay. I used Gentoo Linux for years, it was the most stable Linux distro I'd ever used. In fact, it wasn't until 2 years ago that I switched my server to Fedora. As someone who's used rolling Linux distros, I can say from experience they're more stable. And there's one reason why rolling Linux distros are often more stable than non-rolling Linux distros, superior package management, and testing environments. Rolling Linux distros have extremely good package and dependency management systems. They're so good that's it's virtually impossible to update a package that can cause instability. In fact, an outstanding package manager is the most important prerequisite for a rolling Linux distros or update system. And it's something rolling Linux distros do better than their non-rolling counterparts. I don't want to write another "essay" on the benefits of rolling software updates. You can research the benefits of continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous deployments, or read a book like the Cathedral and the Bazaar for more insights. But research has shown that small, incremental, and continuous updates often result in stable software experiences than periodical code dumps. Why? Because the frameworks that ensure that software systems can be regularly and independently tested, updated, and deployed, also prove that the software being updated has been rigorously tested, is resilient to change and is robust enough to be introduced in any environment. Also small incremental patches are easier to test, manage, and rollback, than large code dumps. The benefits of regular, or rolling updates, are not even the updates themselves. The benefits are the culture it fosters. All parties have to buy into the idea. The testing and deployment frameworks need to be state of the art and on point. Updating software should be second nature and natural to all stakeholders (OEMs, carriers, developers, users). On Linux, nobody blinks twice when there's an OS or kernel update. Same goes for Chrome OS. Or even apps on the Google Play Store. But for some reason, there's always a level of anxiety when it comes to Android OS updates. There's a level of distrust, of angst, of confusion. And the source of all that energy comes from Google. So if Google's Android team can't figure out how to update an OS because they're scared it will break something, it means their build and deployment infrastructure is amateur hour. If it wasn't, we won't be having this conversation about OS and security updates. Meanwhile, my Fedora Workstation updated it's kernel at least 3 times alone in the last month. And that's not even counting how many times core system libraries and packages on it are updated every single day without a single hitch. So, yes, regularly updating an OS and its core system is neither magic nor rocket science. It's a software engineering problem that was solved decades ago. The fact that Google has failed to do it on Android is an embarrassment of the highest order to a company of the caliber of Google. And, even more, an insult the Linux community which their OS is based on, who elegantly solved this problem decades ago. Ammar That's the user's prerogative whether he/she wants to use a phone that way. HeyRadar On my Moto Z I can just keep swapping the battery Mod. needa Till those mods crap out on you. HeyRadar Right. And that's the beauty! I just buy another one and 10 seconds later it's like new. needa No doubt about it, the Z mods being used another year is a good thing. But I am talking about when you can't find one to fit your phone. Kind of like when you can only find a cheap chinese knockoff battery to go in our two year old phone. A battery that new... only has 80% of rated capacity. Happy that you are high on the hog over that moto z, but lets be realistic here. h4rr4r There is no such thing as a non-replaceable battery. They did not place the battery in your phone via teleportation. Batteries can all be replaced, just takes a tiny bit of effort. miscfiles Fair point, but I guess you know that I meant easily removable batteries, like my Galaxy S2 had. h4rr4r Sure, but no battery is really non-replaceable. To many people have learned helplessness. miscfiles I wouldn't expect "the average user" to take their device apart to replace the battery. If nothing else, perhaps Google could provide a reasonably priced battery replacement service. h4rr4r That is the problem right there. You expect helplessness from folks, since our society does, these people to decide they are helpless. You get what you expect. If an a young person in a third world country with little to no training can assemble your phone, if you can afford it odds are you can replace the battery. Screwdrivers, plastic picks and hair dryers are not complicated tools. The kids who do this work at your local mall got little to no training either. miscfiles I've replaced "fixed" phone batteries and USB ports in the past, and I agree that it's not at all hard to do with the right tools. However, I think I'm right in saying that even by opening the case, you've voided the warranty. Sure, nobody would know assuming you didn't make a mistake, but there's definitely room for error there. Would you expect someone like my fictional aunt with poor eyesight to manage those tiny screws and connectors? h4rr4r Why would you do that to a device under warranty? No one would, the warranty would cover the issue. I would expect your fictional aunt to either have glasses, like I do, or to have family members like you. In the worst case your aunt unlike 80% of the population might actually not be capable of replacing battery. However for most folks it is simply learned helplessness. Spencer Walker Sorry of you're rocking a nexus s from 5 years ago but get a new phone John Doe Yes, blame the user not company /s You have about 1.5 BILLION more users to notify LoL How else are people going to buy healthcare? https://youtu.be/wOh9BjQvcAs Spencer Walker While we're at it support the g1 7.0 or riots bitch h4rr4r We don't even get that. John Doe You know what, I was just thinking they can update the G1 to Android Go LoL Colin Richardson My PC is 9½ years old, and cost less than the Pixel phone.. Still getting OS updates.. Though, I do have to pay for an upgrade fee for each major version of Windows.. So maybe not the best analogy. HeyRadar I wouldn't have an issue paying for a new Android on a 3+ year old device. Especially my tablets. If people would pay that would give manufacturers reasons to update their drivers, etc. h4rr4r If drivers were in mainline you can bet your last dollar this problem would have already been solved. People not from the OEM could then roll reliable ROMS and sell subscriptions to them. wat what's 5 years of security updates mean when the not-so-easily replaceable battery starts severely failing after 1 year? ask any nexus 6p owner. Midnitte If any OEM could povide that, I'd probably switch and pay whatever premium they'd need to persuade Qualcomm with Francisco Franco Good luck sustaining a business model where you don't render your old devices obsolete in some way. Like it or not, that's the world right now. Only Apple can pull this off because of the iPhone's "sex appeal" and social recognition, in which people will change phones every 12 months because the newer is always better and more shiny. And also they only support a couple devices and their approach to hardware-software symbiose, which makes it WAY easier to keep supporting older chipsets. I'm not defending either, just commenting on the issue. Rod People will feel compelled to replace their devices naturally, because of better tech, features or due to damage/theft. Thing is, the better the phones become, it will take more time. A current flagship is good for 3 years. marcusmarcus2 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a240cc67aa6bf180000a358f45011d5a5208fd745ddeb341eae6003c46c4c095.gif RenatoFontesTapia If this is compatible with custom roms new devices will last forever :') Nathan J It should be. Right now, your custom ROM includes a lot of if not all the drivers and whatnot, or open source implementations of them. Custom ROMs on the Motorola Photon/Electrify had open source implementations that were bad at best. CM7 was fine, but jump to ICS and you give up your camcorder. Camera is fine, but shoot videos and, nope. Go to JB and you lost Bluetooth. Go to 4.2 and you lost Wi-Fi as well. There was a great CM9 (ICS) build, and we just got a third party camcorder app that could film at VGA, I think. It wasn't a deal breaker then. So yeah, if I understand this correctly, the drivers will all sit on another partition, and ROMs won't be able to touch them. They'll just update the OS. So yes, tl;dr you're absolutely correct, a phone could get updates as long as CM/whatever or whomever wants to support them. Should make their jobs a lot easier, too. In fact, it might spur on a new renaissance of custom firmware development as the bar of skills to develop a custom ROM is basically lowered. YaKillaCJ This could mean a huge change for custom roms. Devs wouldnt have to rewrite, hack, reverse engineer, splice blobs and etc for every major update.Granted they could for better results/cutting edge results but they wouldnt have to Dmitry Stepanushkin "The vendor interface under Project Treble is also designed to be forwards-compatible, meaning that it shouldn't have to be updated for every Android update, in theory." Cmon, Google and huge army of OEMs will find a way to fuck it up and make You buy a new device every 1-2 major OS updates :). Duder12 Yes because Google makes money when you have to buy a new Samsung every year instead of using the same one. fijisiv Did you forget about the Pixel phones? dizel123 Did you forget about the Pixel phones minimal market share and contribution to Alphabet's profits? Tr3ple What? Source? Or Stop spewing bullshit AbdulB1 google device certification program is expensive. D13H4RD2L1V3 I wonder if it being the only device so far to support seamless updates also has something to do with it. Kurt Gomez They had already mentioned this... "In fact, the new Project Treble architecture is already running on the Developer Preview of O for Pixel phones." https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html?m=1 klaus666 The security updates that we get every month list patches for drivers very often. Just search for "Qualcomm" here as an example: https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2017-05-01 If Qualcomm decides to stop releasing new security patches for a given SoC then Treble won't solve this. Thomas Bohn I don't get this. Treble should be part of Android O. Otherwise it is pointless. It should be about to keep phones longer which already exist and not about producing more waste. zepy3 They're not going to support any Nexus phones anymore because they want that brand gone, it's all about Pixel now (which sucks). It's highly unlikely any other phone maker will rush to install this on any previous devices as well because that removes their ability to say "hey buy this phone and it lasts 4 years!". It also reduces the number of devices they'll sell this year because why upgrade when your current phone is good for several more years? So yeah, it's a good point about reducing waste now but the incentive is to reduce waste in the future rather than in the present. saf1927 Hopefully it is the case. Then again, I'd simply buy a new phone every year anyway. YaKillaCJ Hmm, this sounds good buy curious as to its implementation. Can anyone weigh in on how this will work? What Im hoping for is that Kernel/Drivers will be on a separate lower partition thats independent of Android OS itself. Android will use APIs to access everything. The added benefit being that your Android OS can be updated independently of the kernel, much how custom roms on older devices achieve it. This is very well used in linux currently. Old/backwards compatible kernels can boot the latest distro. Same with Windows and its drivers. Albeit that these has limits as some hardware eventual wont be compatible but so long as the basic hardware functions, it can boot and function but missing features. If this is the case, about fucking time! YaKillaCJ Its about fucking time! Fuck a carrier, fuck the OEM, fuck the manufacturers and anyone else who stand in the way of updates. Excuse the language but it had to be said for all use enthusiast. Carson Saldanha No, carriers and OEMs still stand in the way unfortunately. Only this time though, Google has removed the necessity of SoC manufacturer input for updates. AbdulB1 but what about custom roms? YaKillaCJ Well sort of, this gets rid 1 of the, if not the biggest reason for delay. Now OEMs don't have to built the Rom at the kernel, blobs, etc level each major update. This works great for any device not under carrier grip. This the Custom rom community will thrive. OEMs can update devices on MTK is another example. Stylish Frenchie Haha so now luck for s8. Will be updated to 7.1.1 in 2018 and will stuck at 7.1.2 in 2019 xD Nuno G. "One reason could be that the maker of your device's processor (e.g. Snapdragon or MediaTek) never updated the drivers for newer versions of Android." STOP with that stupid excuse!!! Google if they want could make himself device's processor drivers for their phones!!! Microsoft does this, for old hardware, and Windows 10 runs on very old machines... Mike I think you don't understand how drivers are developed. In theory Google could develop drivers but they would waste a ton of time and you'd probably see the same issues that AOSP ROMs face with either degraded performance or some features not working to full potential. Microsoft does not do this actually, sometimes they get lucky and old drivers work with the new OS (Basically how Treble is going to work) but if you remember anything about Vista you will know that they definitely don't make their own drivers. saf1927 Stop spreading bullshit. EvilHowl You don't understand what is a driver Aaron Don't think he knows what a HOLE is, either. :) matteventu AHAHAHAHAHA Aaron https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3843fb66143823d7d717610685198ccf6e75383730360b0afe6b4488d180f267.jpg Eric Walker I don't think you understand anything Qolam Reza Rezaei There is rumor about htc u11 getting 3 major updates if it sells well ! It looks they are talking about the same thing . But you are saying it is normally for devices that ship with o and pixel is a exception , are u sure ? jonzey231 I doubt it'll extend Pixel life. But maybe the'll announce 3-4 years of support for the 2nd gen pixels. matej On which chat did they reveal this? TechGuy22 haha nah they want you to buy pixel 3 XXXXXXXL ddevito "Possibly". That's horseshit. Sink or swim. Either come out and commit to something for a change or people will leave and go to the iPhone. And honestly Google doesn't give a shit, hell their iOS apps work great, if not better, on the iPhone anyway. The last thing they WANT to do is support hardware, the iPhone is perfect for them. They just need to support APPS, not hardware, not the Play Store and not the OS. It's no coincidence their iOS stuff just works better. They HAVE TO support their hardware because (I think) they felt all other OEMs were blowing it big time. dizel123 Android Police is who said "possibly", not Google. So are you really asking Android Police to commit to something on behalf of Google? Or are you just talking horseshit? JD They work way better on iOS JATIN BANSAL Do custom roms like LineageOS create their own drivers as they support some very old devices? If so, why can't google create their own for nexus devices? matteventu Same reason why you can't build your own car and drive on the street but you can drive it in your yard. Adam Margeson You can build your own car and drive it as long as it meets all required regulations - turn signals, mirrors, windshield wipers (yet surprisingly the windshield itself is not a requirement where I live), emission restrictions, etc. To answer OP's question, no, they don't create their own drivers. I think they write compatibility interfaces so that the old driver will continue to work. Either way, they do continue to use whatever proprietary binary blob the device initially came with. Unless someone with more information wants to chime in? matteventu You can write drivers for a Snap800 to run Nougat and use in your own custom ROM/kernel. You can't write drivers for a Snap800 to run Nougat and SELL a device that relies on them (neither update a commercial to them). This voids Qualcomm's agreement. Adam Margeson I don't think any of us are asking about the legal/contract aspect. We're just asking about the technical side - "How do they do it?" Either way, the drivers are still closed-source. matteventu Have you read the first comment of JATIN BANSAL? Adam Margeson Do custom roms like LineageOS create their own drivers as they support some very old devices? Yes. I have. AbdulB1 Vulkan is not supported by qualcomm for sd800/801 Nomaan Nexus 9 doesn't have vulkan support either. AbdulB1 You are right but Qualcomm made that excuse to cripple Android 7 update for SD800/801 based devices. JD They don't. They try to port other driver blobs, make do with the open source drivers that may exist. Failing all of them they use a 'shim' or a middleware. Eg new drivers may directly support the new OS API, but the old won't, so the middleware/shim will try to translate it but it may not work as a software expects or has indirect negative impact eg poor battery life. Stadi "Normally, only phones that ship with Android O will work with Treble" Where does this information come from? And what's the cause of this limitation? So why can't something like an S8 have this once upgraded to O? lomsha Because Google Officer sweetchuck Now if they can just make venders make their interface an option. create812 Whether I decided to keep or sale my Pixel, it'll carry more value forward for me! rmkilc Will this put us to the point where an OS install binary or update binary will be universal or will they still be device dependent? needa It would surprise me if Google did extend it. They knew of this when they announced the two years. Why not say three years, or four years of updates? Not to mention the Pixel is their first dive into their own hardware. I fully expect them to abandon it as soon as they can. Nature of the beast. Rod How do you know they knew about this? needa They cant just think of it a week ago and say hey, this will be on Android O and will also work with the Pixel. ie, this has been in development for longer than a week. Rod Yeah, but Pixel's development started early 2016. Maybe they were devloped at the same time, but they weren't sure it would work and chose not to count on it. needa That very well might b the case. Had that thought run through my mind before I posted. And again when I saw your first. lol But it is the internet... have to stand my ground and cannot be wrong. Rod I forgive you Nomaan If treble isnt part of O builds for nexus 5x, 6p then sure there must be a reason they included it in Pixel. wade_county This is great for people who keep their phones for longer than 2 years. I've already come to grips to the OS update situation and just buy a new phone every year. I stopped caring about if my phone is going to get the next version of Android because the next phone I'll buy will have that new version of Android anyway. If anything, I care more about security updates than the next version. abc Extended support? For a Google device? lol. Good one. Be grateful if Google even makes Pixel devices three years from now. xtess3ractx What I don't understand is, why can't they just use the old drivers if they aren't updated?

Their offerings include software for social media, email, search engine optimization, e-retail targeting, video, consumer rewards, campaign measurement and creative workflow, just to name a few. But behind all this magical cognitive content are brilliant, forward-thinking women and men who are rapidly reimagining marketing and advertising technology (since major cloud players are increasingly blurring the line), pitching a new world order where CRM and digital ads work hand in hand. Here, Adweek salutes the leading figures and trailblazers in the burgeoning field of mar tech. Michelle Peluso CMO, IBM Watson Due to huge AI ambitions, IBM Watson seems to be omnipresent. Last year the Armonk, N.Y.-based tech giant debuted an innovative system called Watson Ads, which lets consumers ask questions by voice or text and receive answers. What’s more, Peluso and her team have IBM utilizing machine learning to run its own programmatic campaigns, reducing cost per click by as much as 70 percent at times. “Michelle is relentless in her focus on clients and what they need, and she is a tireless evangelist who helps teams understand market opportunities,” says Kathy McGettrick, IBM’s vp of market development and insights. Eric Roza Svp, Oracle Data Cloud Oracle has worked overtime in the last month, releasing new AI and chatbot products and forging an over-the-top targeting deal with smart-TV ads player Simulmedia. But the biggest move had Roza’s fingerprints all over it, acquiring notable data measurement firm Moat in mid-April for a reported $850 million. Heineken, Dr Pepper, U.S. Auto Parts and Black Box Wines are among the company’s brand clients, while his division has been busy building on partnerships with Facebook, Snapchat and Pinterest. Gunnard Johnson, Pinterest’s head of measurement science and insights, says Roza’s team has helped his platform show it can drive online and offline sales and “prove that Pinterest is a great place for advertising to happen.” Dan Fichter CTO, Moat Moat aids digital platforms like Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Pandora and Snapchat in weighing the results of online brand campaigns. It’s become a go-to vendor for such measurement needs in recent years. The marketplace clearly sees value in Moat, given its $67.5 million in funding and, most importantly, having been acquired in April by Oracle. What’s more, it offers marketers a strong look into how ads perform according to sight, sound and motion. Who deserves credit? Industry insiders say it’s Fichter. “Moat has grown its attention analytics business by over 100 percent in the past year,” notes Oracle svp Eric Roza. Will Kassoy CEO, AdColony In a marketing world that’s increasingly focused on brand safety, Kassoy’s vast network of mobile apps offers advertisers a strong level of where their messages appear. AdColony reaches 1.5 billion global consumers across the world’s top 1,000 apps, which the company claims is second only to Google. But marketers like UFC particularly love the way Kassoy offers the one-two punch of top-tier segmentation and high-definition video advertising.  “[His company] allowed us to align with a wide range of viewers’ passion points and drastically increase our overall reach and frequency,” says Kristen Bankosz, UFC’s content marketing manager. Manish Mehta CTO, Spredfast Competition among social data companies can be intense, but Mehta seems unstoppable, having increased Spredfast’s revenue by 50 percent last year while adding blue-chip clients like Warner Bros., General Motors and Exelon. Hawaiian Airlines has grown its social audience by nearly 30 percent thanks to his constant product development, directly engaging consumers who are preoccupied with honeymoons, anniversaries and other special occasions. “[It’s proven] the importance of social media as a marketing channel, a customer-care conduit, and also as a way for PR to see and react in real time to what’s happening,” says Asiana Ponciano, Hawaiian Airlines’ consumer affairs manager. David Mendels CEO, Brightcove Mendels’ digital media company, which specializes in video, saw revenue rise 12 percent in 2016 compared to the year prior—often by working with publishers. By pitching location-based data, Brightcove also has attracted an impressive array of clients such as Lowe’s, Dunkin’ Donuts, McDonald’s and Hugo Boss. Lowe’s at times has seen viewers watch an average of 12 minutes per video with Brightcove-powered campaigns. Meanwhile, shopping site AO.com is expanding how it uses Mendels’ system. “We’re looking at how we can use video and multimedia to create an entire video-based home-buying experience,” says Dominic Starkey, director of marketing at AO.com. “We’re also working on integrating interactivity, helping us to expose content in a completely different way, so each video is part of something bigger.” John Ball and Richard Socher Svp and gm, Einstein and chief scientist, Salesforce Ball and Socher are the brainiacs behind Salesforce’s artificial intelligence platform, Einstein, which is super serving clients such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Aldo and online retailer Fanatics. With its small team of five, Fanatics achieved 20 percent email click-through rates while delivering 3.5 billion personalized messages in 2016. Jonathan Wilbur, director of CRM at Fanatics, calls Ball and Socher’s handiwork “a complete game-changer.” Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan CEO, Drawbridge Under Sivaramakrishnan’s stewardship, Drawbridge has revolutionized cross-device data targeting, partnering with Lyft, Oracle, Adobe, M&C Saatchi, Cardlytics, WeatherAlpha and Foursquare. Drawbridge saw 650 percent customer growth last year, expanding its team by more than 70 percent, while adding three times as many programmatic partners. “When you think about a leader, you want someone that can come in and actually create a vision for you, because you might have great ideas, but you don’t know how to take that forward,” says Bhumika Dad-bhawala, Drawbridge’s head of business development. “I think that’s what Kamakshi does really well.” Lloyd Tabb Founder, chairman, CTO, Looker Lloyd Tabb might be the perfect name for a guy who wants to help marketers with too many tabs open, and he’s doing just that with his workflow management software. Dollar Shave Club, Casper and DigitalOcean are communicating with colleagues and partners via digital channels without all that information getting lost in the translation. Tabb’s Looker gathers data from multiple marketing systems and consolidates it so that the stats can be used to search for trends and insights. “Looker gives us the freedom to do more with our data,” says Robert Olson, director of data and analytics at DigitalOcean. “It enables our teams to achieve their goals, with better results, more efficiently and faster.” Robert Schwartz President, Undertone Schwartz’s team adheres to a super-curated approach to digital, and a recent campaign for the band Imagine Dragons seems to underscore Undertone’s philosophy. In the ads, consumers could listen to 20 seconds of the group’s “Believer” single, or click to stream the entire song on Spotify. Users had the option of sharing their own “beliefs,” along with a selfie, on Twitter and Facebook. The ads were extended to sites like MTV, VH1, Spin, Vibe and Refinery29. “Rob has built a culture of innovation and collaboration,” says Mike Pallad, chief revenue officer at Undertone. “Team members are encouraged to push the limits and quickly apply learnings to the business. The result has been consistent best-in-class results for our brand and agency partners.” Cheryl Chavez and Shaun Klopfenstein Group vp of product management and CTO, Marketo Klopfenstein and Chavez have been instrumental in making this San Mateo, Calif.-based marketing software company such a formidable player, introducing core products like the Marketo Engagement Marketing Platform and its Ad Bridge solution and garnering a wide variety of clients. Using the company’s online marketing software, the WNBA’s Seattle Storm increased sales by 20 percent for single-game tickets in 2017 and achieved an 86 percent season ticket renewal rate. “In the first six months after transitioning to Marketo, we grew our database by 25 percent,” adds Kris Kolehmain, director of research and direct marketing for the Storm. Mark Zagorski Evp, Nielsen Marketing Cloud Zagorski shaped many behavioral data practices nearly a decade ago while an exec at eXelate, which Nielsen bought in 2010 and made it a core product of Nielsen Marketing Cloud. Since then, he’s guided a growing mix of TV and digital media metrics for his practically iconic employer. More recently, his team inked an ecommerce stats deal with RichRelevance and extended an agreement with National CineMedia to further theater audience data reporting, giving Nielsen customers like The Company of Others, Scripps Networks and Neogama/BBH an uncommon set of tools. “We now benefit from shared intelligence from multiple channels, which brings greater integration to our full-service offerings,” remarks Luiz Gini, director of general media at Neogama/BBH. Brad Rencher Evp and gm, digital marketing, Adobe When Adobe bought analytics software firm Omniture in 2009, it raised eyebrows among those paying attention to the then-nascent marketing cloud arena. With that noteworthy purchase, Adobe also, more quietly, obtained the talents of Rencher, who was Omniture’s svp of business operations. Since then, Adobe Marketing Cloud has become a force to be reckoned with in digital marketing and advertising, with machine learning that has attracted customers like Philips, Royal Caribbean, Kohl’s, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile. “We’ve been able to deliver personalization at scale, which is a huge breakthrough for us,” says Nick Drake, svp of digital at T-Mobile. “So now every customer is getting a unique experience.” Brian Wong CEO, Kiip Wong has been celebrated as an ad-tech wunderkind since founding Kiip in 2010 at the age of 19. His ambitious mobile rewards-based ad network is the real deal. Kiip’s network offers viewers timely rewards that tie into its ads, garnering 79 percent video completion rates across a mix of 4,000 mobile apps for gaming, fitness and entertainment. Wong has taken Kiip from $7 million in 2014 revenue to $21 million last year, while more than doubling his team to 70 staffers. You want to talk targeting? Brooke Shapiro, Clorox’s group marketing manager, lauds the Kiip network’s ability to leverage “in-app language data in order to reach Hispanic competitive trash bag purchasers during positive mobile moments of the reward.” Jeff Glueck CEO, Foursquare Foursquare was starting to become yesterday’s news, a once-ballyhooed app that just couldn’t scale. But then Glueck took the reins in January 2016 and—with the help of company co-founder Dennis Crowley and president Steven Rosenblatt—turned the New York operation into a hot data service for retailers. With the ability to measure and predict foot traffic with products like Attribution by Foursquare, Glueck’s regime has recently added clients such as Target, Whole Foods and Home Depot after they heard testimonials from the likes of TGI Fridays and coupons player SnipSnap. “[There’s] no need to manually configure thousands of geofences or provision each campaign—instead we were able to know when you’d entered a location and get you the right coupon offer, via a notification front and center,” comments Ted Mann, founder of SnipSnap. Alok Choudhary Chairman and chief scientist, 4C Insights To some, 4C is best known as a social insights company. Choudhary and his team, however, are at the forefront of ad targeting not just online but also via TV. They recently ran a campaign via Turner Broadcasting channels for a major Hollywood film and got three times better engagement when compared to other TV buys. On Facebook, Nice ’n Easy used 4C to sync television spots with Facebook video in the U.K., and the CPG brand got 40 percent more video views than usual at a lower cost per engagement. “Campaign setup and management was intuitive with training and support provided to ensure a seamless activation,” says Oscar Romero, head of biddable international at Performics, which worked on the Nice ’n Easy effort. Michael Seifert CEO and co-founder, Sitecore Seifert boasted 20 percent revenue growth in 2016, marking the sixth consecutive year that his content management and customer experience player scored double-digit percentage sales gains. One client, Danone Nutricia, achieved a 75 percent sales jump thanks to Sitecore’s technology, while Chester Zoo gained a whopping 200 percent increase in mobile conversions. Electronics giant Toshiba is also a fan of Seifert’s company, which provides a framework to create discovery-friendly websites. “We can do more with the site than ever before,” says Andrew Levy, marketing manager, Toshiba’s business communications division. Jeff Green Founder and CEO, The Trade Desk The Trade Desk has been the rock star of ad tech by being ready to provide intel and insights that are perfectly suited for the mobile-and-video era. Green is clearly enjoying being on the cutting edge, after seeing 2016 revenue exceed $203 million, a 78 percent year-over-year lift. With 566 clients and a 95 percent customer retention rate, the future is bright for Green. “I can call him 24/7 with questions about all facets of his global business,” says Steve Katelman, evp of global strategic partnerships at Omnicom Media Group, a Trade Desk partner since 2013. “He understands implicitly how our partnership is a two-way street, and [we] view him as a tremendous asset to the digital industry.” Dean Abbott and Michael Osborne Chief data scientist and CEO, SmarterHQ SmarterHQ recently landed accounts for Santander Bank and Lord & Taylor, bolstering an already impressive customer list that includes Bloomingdale’s, Eddie Bauer and Finish Line. What’s all the fuss? Osborne and Abbott’s AI-fused digital campaigns—that’s what. The tech twosome blends machine learning with other data for real-time customization that take those brands’ ecommerce efforts to the next level. “We didn’t have to spend time getting our data usable for SmarterHQ—they collected it on their own,” says Sean Duffy, vp of customer loyalty and contact strategy at Bloomingdale’s. “Within no time, we were seeing an increase in conversions, and our behaviorally automated campaigns have only grown more sophisticated over time.” Neil Lustig CEO, Sailthru This New York-based email company’s nimbleness is well known among its ecommerce brand clients such as JustFab, merchandisers such as Dr. Martens and media players like Business Insider (and Adweek). Lustig has evolved Sailthru to also offer personalized customer experiences across a brand’s website and mobile applications, though email remains his calling card. Case in point: JustFab.com’s email conversions have recently improved by 50 percent. “[It] has really been the first company that has been a true partner to us,” contends Monica Deretich, vp of CRM at JustFab. “Sailthru has given us the ability to achieve our goals with personalized marketing and to more effectively retain customers and increase customer lifetime value.” Joe Zawadzki CEO, MediaMath Research firm Gartner has characterized Zawadzki as one of programmatic’s original trailblazers, and he continues to take a leadership position in the marketplace. When brand-safety concerns on YouTube in recent weeks gave automated ad buying a black eye, MediaMath quickly announced it would refund marketers if their ads “run on previously determined unsafe inventory” with a system dubbed Curated Market. New clients Coca-Cola, Jet.com and Luisa Via Roma surely applauded that move. Ernesto Almada, digital marketing deputy director for Coca-Cola, says that Zawadzki and his team were helping the beverage brand “evolve and invest resources in programmatic.” Michael and Andrew Katz CEO and CTO, mParticle Four-year-old mParticle works closely with brands like NBC, Jet.com/Walmart, Bleacher Report, Lilly Pulitzer, Airbnb and Spotify to manage their identity-based customer data across channels for more holistic consumer segments. It does so because the Katz brothers have been wise enough to partner with the likes of Adobe, Salesforce, Facebook and Snapchat as well as more niche-oriented data providers like Appboy, Iterable and Leanplum. On the marketing side, the familial executive tandem recently saved Lilly Pulitzer 80 engineering hours while helping increase push notification opt-ins by 40 percent. “Within weeks of implementing mParticle, we saw a faster, more stable app as a result of removing individual vendor code,” says Kim Czopek, Lilly Pulitzer’s vp of digital commerce.

Until he came along, people had few places to go with their overflowing emotions and wild opinions, other than writing a letter to the newspaper or haranguing the neighbours. Williams , a Twitter founder, a co-creator of Blogger , set everyone free, providing tools to address the world. In the history of communications technology, it was, possibly, a development to rival Gutenberg.

More videos Online harassment on the rise In August 2016, Twitter co-founder Evan Williams spoke about his growing concerns surrounding online trolling. And so here we are in 2017. How's it going, Mr Williams? "I think the internet is broken," he says. He has believed this for a few years, actually. But things are getting worse. "And it's a lot more obvious to a lot of people that it's broken." Related Content 'Ruthless': How Zuckerberg keeps Facebook king Worst social network for young people's mental health People are using Facebook to showcase suicides, beatings and murder, in real time. Twitter is a hive of trolling and abuse that it seems unable to stop. Fake news, whether created for ideology or profit, runs rampant. Four out of 10 adult internet users said in a Pew survey that they had been harassed online. And that was before the presidential campaign heated up last year. "I thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place," Williams says. "I was wrong about that." Advertisement The Silicon Valley entrepreneur first drew notice during the dot-com boom, for developing software that allowed users to easily set up a website for broadcasting their thoughts: blogging. By the time Google bought the company in 2003, more than 1 million people were using it. Then came Twitter, which wasn't his idea but was his company. He remains the largest shareholder and a board member.

Williams is trying to fix some things. So, in different ways, are Google and Facebook, and even Twitter. This is a moment for patches and promises. The trouble with the internet, Williams says, is that it rewards extremes. Say you're driving down the road and see a car crash. Of course you look. Everyone looks. The internet interprets behaviour like this to mean everyone is asking for car crashes, so it tries to supply them. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Williams is not proud of the role Twitter played in the election of Donald Trump. Photo: AP His goal is to break this pattern. "If I learn that every time I drive down this road I'm going to see more and more car crashes," he says, "I'm going to take a different road." But a new road may have other problems. It may, for instance, be a dead end. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Critics say Medium is less a company than it is Mr. Williamsâs 85-employee hobby. Photo: Jason Henry/ The New York Times Williams isn't the only one trying to fix this mess, of course. If he and others can't find a path forward, if they can't solve what he calls "the architecture of content creation, distribution and monetisation on the internet," there are unsettling implications for the future of news and ideas. Maybe it will be all car crashes, all the time. Twitter already feels like that. For more than five years, Williams has been refining a communications platform called Medium. Its ambition: define a new model for media in a world struggling under the weight of fake or worthless content. Medium is supposed to be social and collaborative without rewarding the smash-ups. It is supposed to be a force for good. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link "Ev chose the hardest thing to do," says Twitter co-founder Biz Stone. "He said, 'I want to make publishing profitable.' Photo: Bloomberg "A beautiful space for reading and writing , and little else," Williams called Medium at its public debut in 2012. "The words are central." Early chatter was enthusiastic, based on Williams' track record and the site's ease of use. But Medium, which began out of step with nearly all other media, now seems to inhabit a different universe. At a moment when buzz can appear to be everything, Medium is not afraid to be dull. ("How to Expand Your Vocabulary" was featured on the "Popular on Medium" page.) As news becomes more visually oriented, the site stays focused on words. And it continues to strive for the broadest possible reach, welcoming all sorts of untested writers, although that may be changing. Medium's latest incarnation, unveiled in late March, included a $US5 monthly subscription for premium writing. The reaction was underwhelming. "Ev Williams Has Lost His Goddamn Mind," ran the headline in The Next Web, an online publication. Critics say Medium is less a company than it is Williams' 85-employee hobby. "The notion that you're going to succeed as a writing site simply by putting quality first is not compatible with venture capital revenue expectations," said Bill Rosenblatt, a media technology consultant. "No one would have funded this if it weren't by Ev Williams." Williams' supporters say that it is a feature, not a bug, and that publishing needs all the experiments it can get. But they concede the road will be difficult. Biz Stone was at Twitter with Williams from the beginning. He joined his old friend at Medium as both a board member and an investor. "Ev chose the hardest thing to do," Stone says. "He said, 'I want to make publishing profitable.' I was like, 'Yeah, so does everyone else.' How far along are we? Somewhere between zero and half a percent." From the farm to Silicon Valley Williams is 45, bearded and stick-thin. He looks more like a Beatnik poet, staying up until dawn to debate existentialism, than the son of a Nebraska farmer, which he is. Growing up in a place where he felt new people and new ideas were in short supply, he was starved for someone to talk to. Living in a football-loving culture, and hating what he called "the stereotypical jock mentality, small brains thinking they're superior because they're surrounded by big muscles," did not help, Williams said. In 1993, a chance encounter with a new magazine in the Conestoga Mall in Grand Island, Nebraska, seemed to seal his destiny. It was the second issue of Wired, a publication dedicated to the geek gospel that a new world was dawning. One story was about a retired Army colonel named Dave Hughes who wanted to hook up all 5.5 billion brains on the planet. No farmer's kid need ever be lonely again. After a detour or two, Williams arrived in Silicon Valley. If his vision was clear , get rid of the gatekeepers and let people talk , the road was not. Both Blogger, the software he helped develop for blogging, and Twitter diverged from what their startups were actually supposed to be doing, and Twitter in particular involved a lot of well-chronicled drama among the four founders. Williams is deliberate to a fault, and his stint as Twitter's chief executive in 2008 was not a managerial success. "He's not CEO material," his former girlfriend and the co-developer of Blogger, Meg Hourihan, said in 2010 when the Twitter board pushed him out. A few years ago, Twitter was viewed as a tool of liberation. It enabled, some believed, the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East. Twitter, like the internet itself, was putting tyranny on a short leash. Then the narrative turned darker, with the rise of trolling on the platform. President Donald Trump has said he believes Twitter put him in the White House. Recently, Williams heard the claim for the first time. He mulled it over for a bit, sitting in his Medium office, which is noteworthy only for not having a desk. "It's a very bad thing, Twitter's role in that," he said finally. "If it's true that he wouldn't be president if it weren't for Twitter, then yeah, I'm sorry." The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Williams' remarks. In a commencement speech at the University of Nebraska this month, Williams noted that Silicon Valley has a tendency to see itself as a Prometheus, stealing fire from selfish gatekeeper gods and bestowing it on mere mortals. "What we tend to forget is that Zeus was so pissed at Prometheus that he chained him to a rock so eagles could peck out his guts for eternity," Williams told the crowd. "Some would say that's what we deserve for giving the power of tweets to Donald Trump." Williams' mistake was expecting the internet to resemble the person he saw in the mirror: serious, high-minded. "I've come to realise Ev is extremely intellectual and introspective," Stone says. "If he could wave a magic wand, he'd have everyone write the kind of things he likes, like, 'Here are suggestions on climate change.'" It was just another Utopian dream, Williams says. "The problem is that not everyone is going to be cool, because humans are humans," he says. "There's a lock on our office door and our homes at night. The internet was started without the expectation that we'd have to do that online." Medium, and Money Writers want readers and, usually, money. Readers want to be entertained, instructed or outraged. Publishers need revenues and profits. Yet no one has come up with a satisfactory and sustainable way of harnessing the internet to satisfy all these parties without descending into sleaze and clickbait. "Now that we've made sharing information virtually effortless, how do we increase depth of understanding, while also creating a level playing field that encourages ideas that come from anywhere?" Williams wrote in Medium's 2012 manifesto. Money, of course. In the beginning, Medium had an editorial staff that sought out writers and rewarded them modestly for their contributions, just like a traditional magazine. Abby Norman, then in her early 20s and working for the medical records department of a Maine hospital, was pulled in. "Medium was a group of writers loping around at a somewhat sedentary pace, and you could get $US50 for a bleeding-heart essay and forge relationships with writers and editors," she says. "They seduced me into this idea, that I had stuff worth saying." Norman wrote 100 Medium pieces in a year, about her brother's autism, her mother's bulimia, her own health, and the enduring carnival that is popular culture. Some of them she was even paid for. She gained a following. But as Medium grew more popular with writers, she competed to be heard above the din and struggled to find people that she herself wanted to read on the site. "Now being here is work, and it's not 'digging for buried treasure' fun work, either," she wrote on Medium last September. Medium was supposed to be developing its business around advertising, which would have paid for writers like Norman and made the site viable. Then it abruptly pivoted in January and laid off a third of the staff, or about 45 people. Advertising was suddenly no longer the solution but the villain. "Ad-driven systems can only reward attention," Williams says. "They can't reward the right answer. Consumer-paid systems can. They can reward value. The inevitable solution: People will have to pay for quality content." Medium declined to say how many subscribers it has, saying that its effort is still informal. In any case, it's not going to be an online magazine. Williams resists the notion that Medium should be seen as a traditional publisher, commissioning, editing and making stuff available. He suggested instead the bookstore model. Bookstores don't commission material, but they curate it and sell it. "Write whatever you want, and we'll pay you based on certain terms," Williams says now. "Does that mean I'm the publisher, or you?" As Medium struggles to define itself, the older new communications platforms , Google, Facebook, Twitter , are trying to deal with their unexpected toxicity. Facebook is hiring thousands of screeners to monitor its Facebook Live. Google has announced structural changes to make it easier for human raters to flag low-quality results, so that asking "Did the Holocaust happen," for instance, no longer brings up a white supremacist site. And Twitter seems to have had fewer reported episodes of harassment recently, which may count as progress. "I think we will fix these things," Williams says. Just don't hold your breath. The work has barely begun, he says. "Twenty years isn't very long to change how society works." Already a relic? James Hong, best known for the popular rating-and-dating site Hot or Not? in the early 2000s, was an angel investor in Medium. He once told Williams that he had some new ideas about dating sites but feared that if he tackled them, "I'd be working on the same thing my whole entire life." Williams had pondered for a moment and replied, "I've been working on the same thing my whole life." Hong said: "It's not a vanity project. It's his calling. Other people calling it a vanity project actually tells me more about them than it does about Evan." That kind of determination may raise the odds but says little about long-term success. The darkest theory about the failure of Medium to catch on as an influential writing site comes from Cliff Watson, a 46-year-old advertising executive and onetime Medium contributor from Omaha, Nebraska. He thinks it is already a relic of an earlier era, kind of like communicating by carrier pigeon or telegraph. "Medium feels like the perfect Obama-era platform: minimal, distinguished, self-important, elevated," Watson says. "But as soon as the campaigns really ramped up their efforts in the primaries, we were living in a post-Obama world, metaphorically, and then literally. And that post-Obama world holds no room for minimalist, distinguished, self-important, elevated thoughtfulness." Medium maintains it is doing well by the metrics it cares about. The company says that the number of posts on the site quadrupled in 2016 and that it has 60 million unique monthly readers. After raising $US130 million from investors, it had a valuation of $US600 million last year. Yet the path to significant revenue seems as elusive as ever. Williams is dismissive of those who say making Medium viable is not merely difficult but flat-out impossible. "That's why I'm doing this, and they're not," he says. The site is soliciting writers again. Norman recently got the call. Since she stopped focusing on Medium, her career has blossomed , she wrote a book on medical treatment of women's pain, which is coming out next year from Nation Books , even as her health has declined from autoimmune ailments. "I've been trying not to die, frankly," she says. "I've really moved on to other things out of necessity." And yet. Medium hasn't solved the problem of publishing on the internet, but neither has anyone else. "I'll pitch them, because I've been invested all this time and I've hung on and hung on," she says. "I'd like to see how it all pans out. I'd like to see it through."

Online Learning Update May 22, 2017 What does voice search mean for your local SEO strategy? Filed under: Online Learning News — Ray Schroeder @ 12:05 am by Chris Camps, ClickZ Voice search is a growing trend that has been pinging the radars of savvy search marketers for the last few years. In 2016, conversational AI company MindMeld surveyed smartphone users in the US, finding that 60% of users who used voice search had started using it in the last past year – indicating rising adoption rates. This is backed up by Mary Meeker’s 2016 Internet Trends Report, which found that Google voice search queries in 2016 are up 35x over 2008, now making up 20% of searches made with the Google Android app. Whereas regular searches usually just include keywords. In fact, Google is currently working to better accommodate these so-called ‘natural language’ queries. At the Google I/O developer conference last year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed Google Assistant’s ability to handle follow-up questions without the need to re-state the context. https://www.clickz.com/what-does-voice-search-mean-for-your-local-seo-strategy/110541/ Share on Facebook Comments Off No Comments No comments yet.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 22 May 2017 Piracy is theft Illegal streaming may be convenient, but at the end of the day, it is still illegal. SOME consumers believe that streaming or downloading content that is illegally ­available online is a victimless crime. What they seem to forget is that it is a crime. According to the “Global Piracy Insights Report 2017” by Muso, a London-based piracy tracking company, over 179 billion visits to piracy sites were recorded globally last year. The study tracked global traffic from 23,000 of the largest piracy sites and 200 ­million devices. With over 20.3 billion visits to pirate sites, the United States ranks first in online piracy, with Russia (14.1 billion) and India (9.7 ­billion) trailing behind. The actual “cost” to the film and entertainment industry is difficult to pinpoint, although the oft-cited 2006 study by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), conducted by the Institute for Policy Innovation, estimated that film piracy sets back the US economy alone a whopping US$20.5bil (RM88.7bil) annually. “The effect of online piracy on both the film and television industry is significant. Consumers looking to watch a film or ­television show online will often turn to ­illegal websites, rather than to those offering authorised versions. “These illegal websites are making a lot of money from advertisers who frequent the sites because of the high volume of ­infringing traffic. This revenue should be going to the filmmakers and legitimate rights holders,” says a Motion Picture Association spokesperson from its Asia Pacific ­headquarters in Singapore. But illegal streaming, downloads and hardware, don’t just harm relevant media companies; they could potentially prove ­disastrous to consumers as well. An article in the Business Insider states that a joint study conducted by the KU Leuven University in Belgium and the Stony Brook University in the US found that around half of the ads hosted on illegal sports streaming sites are malicious. The research, posted on the KU Leuven’s official website, claims that browsers like Google Chrome and Safari were more ­targeted than the rest, and in some cases, they found scripts that detected ad-blocking software and tried to bypass it. Issue at hand The Global Piracy report indicates that entertainment and media companies should be vigilant against unlawful streaming sites. These websites illegally host full movies or TV shows, and generate revenue from ads. Over 107 billion visits to these sites were tracked last year, mostly via desktop and with direct traffic to the websites. “Rogue sites that specialise in online ­piracy are commercial ventures, which means that one effective way to combat them is to cut off their money supply,” says a Google ­spokesperson. But digital and content piracy are not ­contained to just desktop and mobile devices. While the possession of set-top or multi-­media boxes is not illegal, streaming channels without the approval of the copyright holders is an offence in Malaysia. According to Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission’s network ­security and enforcement sector chief officer Zulkarnain Mohd Yasin, the local market for illegal streaming services is probably wide because Malaysia currently has 20 million active Internet users. During an interview with Astro Arena, Zulkarnain also stated that many Malaysians are still ­unaware that creating, utilising and selling illegal streaming services and set-top boxes is against the law. Under the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, an ­unlicensed service provider or person who possesses illegal ­network service, on ­conviction, is liable to be fined. “For example, if the user is found guilty under Section 232, the fine is RM300,000; under Section 236 the fine is RM500,000 and under Section 239 it is RM100,000,” he said. Zulkarnain reminded the viewers that many filmmakers, service providers and ­production houses are financially invested in the industry, and if the illegal streaming and downloading continues, it would affect the industry as a whole. “We would see a decrease in the production of local content, and this would in turn affect our local industry,” he added. MPA stresses that online piracy affects ­people who are working in the industry. “The film industry supports the jobs of thousands of people both in Malaysia and around the world. These are real people with real jobs, such as the student who serves ­popcorn at the local cinema, or dedicated ­producers who need to prove to their ­investors that their valuable investment will not go to waste if the film is pirated – which is often the case,” says the MPA spokesperson. Fighting back Earlier this year, the ­government in Britain reached a truce with tech giants Google and Microsoft that allows its ­copyright body to monitor the search results they provide for illegal websites. According to The Telegraph, under the new voluntary code, Google and Microsoft have agreed to “demote websites that have repeatedly been served with ­copyright infringement notices, so that they do not appear on the first page for ­common searches”. The search engines’ autocomplete features are required to remove terms that would lead users to pirate websites. As early as 2010, Google began making substantial investments in streamlining the copyright removal process for search results. These improved procedures allow Google to process copyright removal requests for search results at the rate of millions per week with an average turnaround time of less than six hours. Meeting demand “Piracy often arises when consumer demand goes unmet by legitimate supply. The best way to battle piracy is with better, more convenient, legitimate alternatives to piracy, which can do far more than attempts at enforcement can,” says Google’s spokesperson. Legal streaming services available in Malaysia include dimsum, Astro Go, iflix and Netflix. MPA believes that curbing piracy requires a multi-pronged approach. “This includes awareness campaigns to encourage audiences to access content legally; enforcement actions to take down major pirate operations; ­working with ISPs to block access to major pirate websites; voluntary agreements between industry, government and the ­advertising community to cut off advertising revenue flowing to infringing websites; and reducing the availability of set-top boxes which have pre-installed pirate apps,” says the MPA spokesperson.

Climate change looks for a new image By Reuters Published: 20:04 EDT, 21 May 2017 | Updated: 20:04 EDT, 21 May 2017 e-mail By Laurie Goering LONDON, May 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - What does climate change look like? For many people, the first - or perhaps only - image that comes to mind is of smokestacks, or polar bears perched on ice floes. "If you go to Google and click on climate change images, you have to go a long way before you hit many images of people," says Adam Corner, research director at Climate Outreach, an Oxford-based thinktank that aims to boost public engagement on climate change. But climate change already is affecting billions of people around the world, from farmers in Zimbabwe experimenting with new crops to battle drought to grandmothers in India who earn cash selling solar home lighting systems, or children in the United States coping with a longer allergy season. Getting more of those people-focused images into the media, into NGO campaigns and into other public communications could help more people identify with the problem, see the opportunities and understand the need for action, Corner said. "There´s nothing wrong with polar bears," he said. "But they´re very distancing images. They identify climate change as something that happens far away where most people´s lives aren´t. They don´t do justice to the richness of the human experience of climate change." In an effort to widen that narrow view, Corner´s organisation has launched a new portal for climate change images. Inspired by Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg´s Lean In effort - which has worked to make sure online searches for images of women offer up more than just lingerie models - the Climate Visuals portal showcases a diverse range of climate change photographs drawn from stock photo agencies. Images so far, provided by early partners such as U.S.-based Aurora Photos, include U.S. homeowners installing attic insulation, women in Burkina Faso pumping scarce water, and European researchers studying the migration of grasses in the Alps. There are scientists monitoring glaciers too - but no polar bears. "The question is, if you make a change upstream in what´s available, can you politically influence the way people think about that issue?" Corner said. "Climate change has gotten stuck behind some iconic but limited images. We´re trying to kickstart a broader, more diverse visual language for it." WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS The not-for-profit effort is far from the first to try to reshape thinking about global warming and help people engage with what, for some, feels like an invisible and distant problem despite its clear and growing threats. But the project is one of the first to look at images, rather than language, something Corner finds surprising. "It´s very strange given we´re an increasingly visual culture," he said. "The old adage about a picture painting a thousand words is really true - especially given attention spans." Before launching the portal, Corner and colleagues conducted surveys in the United States, Britain and Germany to find out what people liked - and didn´t - about photographs of climate change. What they discovered is that viewers wanted to see people dealing with or taking action on climate change - though many said they´re tired of seeing climate change protesters. However, people don´t like being made to feel guilty about their personal choices - such as flying rather than taking the train, or eating steak rather than vegetables - so showing a family going on holiday on a plane as an example of what needs to change "can backfire", Corner said. Photographs of traffic jams or industrial-scale food waste - both contributors to climate change - "people were more able to accept as a cause of climate change and relate to", he said. Corner hopes the new portal will attract a range of contributors and users, including media, NGOs and campaign groups. Users will be able to click on the images on the portal and be taken directly back to the agencies that supplied the photos, with the agencies handling any sales. He is also working with World Press Photo to try to establish a new award category for climate change photographs in next year´s competition - another way to encourage thinking about a broader range of climate images beyond polar bears and smokestacks. "The question is, what would happen if you don´t get just that narrow range of images?" he asked. "Do people go clicking for polar bears? Or would they be happy to find a more diverse range of human stories - something they can relate to?"

[Pawcket Dialing] Google Phone 9.0 hides a hilarious Paw Mode easter egg Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 6:00am PDTMay 12, 2017 79 Plus 1 on G+ 284 Share on Facebook 99 Share on Twitter Total Shares462 Applications Google News Videos While pawking around in the latest Google Phone 9.0, our resident APK master, Cody, uncovered one unexpected piece of evidence: paws. The animal kind. Cat and dog paws had infiltrated the installation file for seemingly no reason. This of course gave him pawse as he examined all the weird ways in which they could be used then came up empty. But we wouldn't be the Android Pawlice if we didn't have secret informants ready to do the dirty work on the ground and come back with hints and sometimes answers to our investigations. And this is what we're here to talk about: the paw mystery has been solved. Tipster Kieron Quinn pawndered all the ways he could unravel the enigma and found the solution: there's a listener in the manifest that triggers when you dial *#*#729#*#* (geddit? 729 = PAW) and enables "Paw Mode." So when you receive a phone call, a furry cat or a dog paw will pawp up on the screen and show you how to slide the button to answer the call. The choice between the two is random, but as Cody observed, the cat should have had boots: that's much more pawsitively irresistible. You can disable Paw Mode by dialing the same code again and that's really all there is to this easter egg. It's not as pawlished as some other hidden gems we've uncovered over the years, but who cares? The adorable cuteness pawer of puppies and kittens is more than enough. Here's a video of the easter egg in action and I'll stop talking before I further ruin this pawst. Download QR-Code Phone Developer: Google Inc.

Gurkanwal Singh Go to this XDA link and download Google Phone APK https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-google-dialer-t3557412 ENJOY FernandoRocker Gracias, good sir. StockAndroid How would I know when there's a new version? Gurkanwal Singh Visit that XDA thread regularly Michael Hannigan It will have paws in it. Jishnu Dey So is this a pawssible reason for installing this app? 4Ui812 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0925715e6647925a2a97a5186c29f2d7076d47c6eeb43b9408b889689c3472d6.gif Anna Bobanna They should save these eastereggs until they fix the dialer app. Back in the version where you slid right and left to answer/ignore calls, it was easier to flag spam calls and ignore them. When they moved to the up and down motions to answer/ignore calls, they dropped a lot of the spam calling functionality. But they have time to put in useless eastereggs. JD Googler: "Look I put in this great easter egg in this new app update" QA: "We found a number of bugs in the latest app and none of the old bugs have been fixed, in fact it's failed regression testing as well" Googler: "But Look there's a cat's paw" QA: "OUUU Approved!" Michael Hannigan Get back in your pawta potty. ilovetesla how did that mouse pointer how to emulate android as shown in the video Kieron Quinn I was using the AVD from Android Studio, 7.1.1 (x86_64 with Google Apps) ilovetesla whoa tipster that was an awesome tip and thanks man TechGuy22 LOL gonna do that now Total Insecurity I need this in EVERY Google Product! Skylar Ragan I have Google phone 9.0 and am running Android 7.1.2 on my Nexus 6P, but after I enable Paw mode, instead of a paw appearing on the screen to show me which way to swipe, it's just a slightly larger green dot than the FAB. I feel so robbed of adorableness. Skylar Ragan Never mind, it worked the second time. Hideaki Watanabe I have the same green dot when I tried this. Did you disable then re-enable? Skylar Ragan Yep, that's what seemed to work for me. AJKahn I come to the comments section for the puns and the memes!!!! Fernando Pena Because, why not? segag Pawsome!

Can you please find more stuff like this? jeffity Why does this matter? It seems pretty inconsequential, and just a reason for the writer to come up with loads of puns.

 Panasonic is making a massive bet on electric cars — here's why the US CEO says it's a 'slam dunk' investment Danielle Muoio May 21, 2017, 10:37 AM 7,292 facebook linkedin twitter email print Panasonic focused on auto tech during CES in January, Thomson Reuters Panasonic, like many companies today, is betting big on auto tech becoming a massive cash cow in the next decade. New alliances are forming almost every day as companies without a traditional foothold in the automotive space try to get a slice of the pie. Google is working with Fiat Chrysler on self-driving cars while making next-generation display systems for Volvo; new software startups like Otonomo are shelling out their services to major companies like Daimler; and BMW is partnering with companies like Intel on data collection. Panasonic is just one of many players collaborating with the auto industry to focus on vehicles of the future. "Our business has evolved over a period of time, especially in the recent past of going from purely a consumer business to a B2B business," Tom Gebhardt, chairman and CEO of Panasonic's North American operations, told Business Insider. "There's a number of reasons for that: The commoditization of consumer products [and] the unfavorability in some of the cost models led us to look for better values in-vehicle technologies," he continued. Working with Tesla and Google Tom Gebhardt, chairman and CEO of Panasonic's North American operations. Panasonic Prior to taking over Panasonic's North American division in April, Gebhardt led the company's automotive division for five years.  Placing an executive with several years of automotive expertise at the helm of North American operations says something about the company's pivot from consumer electronics to auto tech. That larger cultural shift came from Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga when he took over in 2012. As Forbes details in a 2016 profile, Tsuga was key to transitioning Panasonic from its failing plasma TV business to other revenue streams, like in-flight entertainment systems in planes and electric cars. Panasonic isn't stretching too far from its roots when it comes to this kind of vehicle tech. Gebhardt noted that Panasonic had a presence in the car radio business starting in 2008, giving it a natural introduction to multimedia displays with its electronics background. Gebhardt said Panasonic is channeling resources toward digital cockpits and vehicle entertainment systems as self-driving vehicles become more in reach. "If the scenario says the car drives itself, it’s similar to sitting in an airplane seat because you’re no longer actively driving," he said. "We see that as an evolution of the space that’s quite interesting going forward that has infinite possibilities for us." Fiat Chrysler's portal concept. Screenshot As an extension of that plan, Panasonic recently worked with Fiat Chrysler on its semi-autonomous Portal concept car shown off at CES in January. The concept featured electronics like an OLED touchscreen with facial and voice recognition. Panasonic sees itself playing a role in fully autonomous cars as well by developing mobile offices or televisions specifically for self-driving cars, Gebhardt said. Perhaps more notable is Panasonic's relationship with Telsa. As one of the largest battery manufacturers in the world, competing with the likes of LG Chem and Samsung SDI, Panasonic had an easy entry into the electric vehicle space. The company plans to invest $1.6 billion in Tesla's Gigafactory. "The future is definitely electric, no question in my mind, it’s more of, 'what is the future timeline?' Is it 10 years, 15 years, 40 years?" Gebhardt said. "We don’t see an alternative more interesting that, it’s just a matter of what the adoption hits at the scale that makes this a slam dunk." Tesla's massive battery plant, the Gigafactory, in Sparks, Nevada. YouTube/Matthew Roberts But, there are hurdles to overcome in both these spaces. From the connected vehicle side, consumer adoption of infotainment systems is still lagging. J.D. Power led a 2016 study that found that more than 50% of car owners never used their in-vehicle displays after 90 days of purchase, preferring the ease of using their smartphones. But the tech is still in its first-generation, Gebhardt said, adding adoption will improve with the technology. Google's new Android display, for example, will integrate its smart voice assistant to encourage usage while driving. "Any time you’re dealing with a first generation product, a user is not going to be overly comfortable," he said. As for electric cars, vehicle adoption in the US is still tepid, and global sales hover at 1%. Gebhardt acknowledged adoption is slow in the US, particularly due to low gas prices — a trend that is likely to persist if Trump comes through on his promise to roll back fuel emissions standards. He said, however, that this is likely a "short-term problem." While the US market is slow to progress, there's still hope when it comes to China, which is making a concerted effort to incentivize battery-powered vehicles. China "being the largest car market in the world has a big influence on what will happen," Gebhardt said. "If they adopt in a big way, that changes the balance of where electric is today versus where it will be going." Panasonic has made some heavy investments in nascent areas, but expects to see a return on investment soon. Tsuga recently said Panasonic is expecting an increase in net profit in fiscal year 2017, its first gain in two years, because of new bets on transit, Nikkei Asian Review reported. "We're pretty bullish on the fact that this is a space that will continue to grow and there’s value there," Gebhardt said. Get the latest Tesla stock price here.

Williams , a Twitter founder, a co-creator of Blogger , set everyone free, providing tools to address the world.

More videos Online harassment on the rise In August 2016, Twitter co-founder Evan Williams spoke about his growing concerns surrounding online trolling. And so here we are in 2017. How's it going, Mr Williams? "I think the internet is broken," he says. He has believed this for a few years, actually. But things are getting worse. "And it's a lot more obvious to a lot of people that it's broken." Related Content 'Ruthless': How Zuckerberg keeps Facebook king Worst social network for young people's mental health People are using Facebook to showcase suicides, beatings and murder, in real time. Twitter is a hive of trolling and abuse that it seems unable to stop. Fake news, whether created for ideology or profit, runs rampant. Four out of 10 adult internet users said in a Pew survey that they had been harassed online. And that was before the presidential campaign heated up last year. "I thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place," Williams says. "I was wrong about that." Advertisement The Silicon Valley entrepreneur first drew notice during the dot-com boom, for developing software that allowed users to easily set up a website for broadcasting their thoughts: blogging. By the time Google bought the company in 2003, more than 1 million people were using it. Then came Twitter, which wasn't his idea but was his company. He remains the largest shareholder and a board member. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The trouble with the internet, Williams says, is that it rewards extremes.  Photo: Jason Henry/ The New York Times After fame and fortune come regrets. Williams is trying to fix some things. So, in different ways, are Google and Facebook, and even Twitter. This is a moment for patches and promises. The trouble with the internet, Williams says, is that it rewards extremes. Say you're driving down the road and see a car crash. Of course you look. Everyone looks. The internet interprets behaviour like this to mean everyone is asking for car crashes, so it tries to supply them. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Williams is not proud of the role Twitter played in the election of Donald Trump. Photo: AP His goal is to break this pattern. "If I learn that every time I drive down this road I'm going to see more and more car crashes," he says, "I'm going to take a different road." But a new road may have other problems. It may, for instance, be a dead end. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Critics say Medium is less a company than it is Mr. Williamsâs 85-employee hobby. Photo: Jason Henry/ The New York Times Williams isn't the only one trying to fix this mess, of course. If he and others can't find a path forward, if they can't solve what he calls "the architecture of content creation, distribution and monetisation on the internet," there are unsettling implications for the future of news and ideas. Maybe it will be all car crashes, all the time. Twitter already feels like that. For more than five years, Williams has been refining a communications platform called Medium. Its ambition: define a new model for media in a world struggling under the weight of fake or worthless content. Medium is supposed to be social and collaborative without rewarding the smash-ups. It is supposed to be a force for good. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link "Ev chose the hardest thing to do," says Twitter co-founder Biz Stone. "He said, 'I want to make publishing profitable.' Photo: Bloomberg "A beautiful space for reading and writing , and little else," Williams called Medium at its public debut in 2012. "The words are central." Early chatter was enthusiastic, based on Williams' track record and the site's ease of use. But Medium, which began out of step with nearly all other media, now seems to inhabit a different universe. At a moment when buzz can appear to be everything, Medium is not afraid to be dull. ("How to Expand Your Vocabulary" was featured on the "Popular on Medium" page.) As news becomes more visually oriented, the site stays focused on words. And it continues to strive for the broadest possible reach, welcoming all sorts of untested writers, although that may be changing. Medium's latest incarnation, unveiled in late March, included a $US5 monthly subscription for premium writing. The reaction was underwhelming. "Ev Williams Has Lost His Goddamn Mind," ran the headline in The Next Web, an online publication. Critics say Medium is less a company than it is Williams' 85-employee hobby. "The notion that you're going to succeed as a writing site simply by putting quality first is not compatible with venture capital revenue expectations," said Bill Rosenblatt, a media technology consultant. "No one would have funded this if it weren't by Ev Williams." Williams' supporters say that it is a feature, not a bug, and that publishing needs all the experiments it can get. But they concede the road will be difficult. Biz Stone was at Twitter with Williams from the beginning. He joined his old friend at Medium as both a board member and an investor. "Ev chose the hardest thing to do," Stone says. "He said, 'I want to make publishing profitable.' I was like, 'Yeah, so does everyone else.' How far along are we? Somewhere between zero and half a percent." From the farm to Silicon Valley Williams is 45, bearded and stick-thin. He looks more like a Beatnik poet, staying up until dawn to debate existentialism, than the son of a Nebraska farmer, which he is. Growing up in a place where he felt new people and new ideas were in short supply, he was starved for someone to talk to. Living in a football-loving culture, and hating what he called "the stereotypical jock mentality, small brains thinking they're superior because they're surrounded by big muscles," did not help, Williams said. In 1993, a chance encounter with a new magazine in the Conestoga Mall in Grand Island, Nebraska, seemed to seal his destiny. It was the second issue of Wired, a publication dedicated to the geek gospel that a new world was dawning. One story was about a retired Army colonel named Dave Hughes who wanted to hook up all 5.5 billion brains on the planet. No farmer's kid need ever be lonely again. After a detour or two, Williams arrived in Silicon Valley. If his vision was clear , get rid of the gatekeepers and let people talk , the road was not. Both Blogger, the software he helped develop for blogging, and Twitter diverged from what their startups were actually supposed to be doing, and Twitter in particular involved a lot of well-chronicled drama among the four founders. Williams is deliberate to a fault, and his stint as Twitter's chief executive in 2008 was not a managerial success. "He's not CEO material," his former girlfriend and the co-developer of Blogger, Meg Hourihan, said in 2010 when the Twitter board pushed him out. A few years ago, Twitter was viewed as a tool of liberation. It enabled, some believed, the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East. Twitter, like the internet itself, was putting tyranny on a short leash. Then the narrative turned darker, with the rise of trolling on the platform. President Donald Trump has said he believes Twitter put him in the White House. Recently, Williams heard the claim for the first time. He mulled it over for a bit, sitting in his Medium office, which is noteworthy only for not having a desk. "It's a very bad thing, Twitter's role in that," he said finally. "If it's true that he wouldn't be president if it weren't for Twitter, then yeah, I'm sorry." The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Williams' remarks. In a commencement speech at the University of Nebraska this month, Williams noted that Silicon Valley has a tendency to see itself as a Prometheus, stealing fire from selfish gatekeeper gods and bestowing it on mere mortals. "What we tend to forget is that Zeus was so pissed at Prometheus that he chained him to a rock so eagles could peck out his guts for eternity," Williams told the crowd. "Some would say that's what we deserve for giving the power of tweets to Donald Trump." Williams' mistake was expecting the internet to resemble the person he saw in the mirror: serious, high-minded. "I've come to realise Ev is extremely intellectual and introspective," Stone says. "If he could wave a magic wand, he'd have everyone write the kind of things he likes, like, 'Here are suggestions on climate change.'" It was just another Utopian dream, Williams says. "The problem is that not everyone is going to be cool, because humans are humans," he says. "There's a lock on our office door and our homes at night. The internet was started without the expectation that we'd have to do that online." Medium, and Money Writers want readers and, usually, money. Readers want to be entertained, instructed or outraged. Publishers need revenues and profits. Yet no one has come up with a satisfactory and sustainable way of harnessing the internet to satisfy all these parties without descending into sleaze and clickbait. "Now that we've made sharing information virtually effortless, how do we increase depth of understanding, while also creating a level playing field that encourages ideas that come from anywhere?" Williams wrote in Medium's 2012 manifesto. Money, of course. In the beginning, Medium had an editorial staff that sought out writers and rewarded them modestly for their contributions, just like a traditional magazine. Abby Norman, then in her early 20s and working for the medical records department of a Maine hospital, was pulled in. "Medium was a group of writers loping around at a somewhat sedentary pace, and you could get $US50 for a bleeding-heart essay and forge relationships with writers and editors," she says. "They seduced me into this idea, that I had stuff worth saying." Norman wrote 100 Medium pieces in a year, about her brother's autism, her mother's bulimia, her own health, and the enduring carnival that is popular culture. Some of them she was even paid for. She gained a following. But as Medium grew more popular with writers, she competed to be heard above the din and struggled to find people that she herself wanted to read on the site. "Now being here is work, and it's not 'digging for buried treasure' fun work, either," she wrote on Medium last September. Medium was supposed to be developing its business around advertising, which would have paid for writers like Norman and made the site viable. Then it abruptly pivoted in January and laid off a third of the staff, or about 45 people. Advertising was suddenly no longer the solution but the villain. "Ad-driven systems can only reward attention," Williams says. "They can't reward the right answer. Consumer-paid systems can. They can reward value. The inevitable solution: People will have to pay for quality content." Medium declined to say how many subscribers it has, saying that its effort is still informal. In any case, it's not going to be an online magazine. Williams resists the notion that Medium should be seen as a traditional publisher, commissioning, editing and making stuff available. He suggested instead the bookstore model. Bookstores don't commission material, but they curate it and sell it. "Write whatever you want, and we'll pay you based on certain terms," Williams says now. "Does that mean I'm the publisher, or you?" As Medium struggles to define itself, the older new communications platforms , Google, Facebook, Twitter , are trying to deal with their unexpected toxicity. Facebook is hiring thousands of screeners to monitor its Facebook Live. Google has announced structural changes to make it easier for human raters to flag low-quality results, so that asking "Did the Holocaust happen," for instance, no longer brings up a white supremacist site. And Twitter seems to have had fewer reported episodes of harassment recently, which may count as progress. "I think we will fix these things," Williams says. Just don't hold your breath. The work has barely begun, he says. "Twenty years isn't very long to change how society works." Already a relic? James Hong, best known for the popular rating-and-dating site Hot or Not? in the early 2000s, was an angel investor in Medium. He once told Williams that he had some new ideas about dating sites but feared that if he tackled them, "I'd be working on the same thing my whole entire life." Williams had pondered for a moment and replied, "I've been working on the same thing my whole life." Hong said: "It's not a vanity project. It's his calling. Other people calling it a vanity project actually tells me more about them than it does about Evan." That kind of determination may raise the odds but says little about long-term success. The darkest theory about the failure of Medium to catch on as an influential writing site comes from Cliff Watson, a 46-year-old advertising executive and onetime Medium contributor from Omaha, Nebraska. He thinks it is already a relic of an earlier era, kind of like communicating by carrier pigeon or telegraph. "Medium feels like the perfect Obama-era platform: minimal, distinguished, self-important, elevated," Watson says. "But as soon as the campaigns really ramped up their efforts in the primaries, we were living in a post-Obama world, metaphorically, and then literally. And that post-Obama world holds no room for minimalist, distinguished, self-important, elevated thoughtfulness." Medium maintains it is doing well by the metrics it cares about. The company says that the number of posts on the site quadrupled in 2016 and that it has 60 million unique monthly readers. After raising $US130 million from investors, it had a valuation of $US600 million last year. Yet the path to significant revenue seems as elusive as ever. Williams is dismissive of those who say making Medium viable is not merely difficult but flat-out impossible. "That's why I'm doing this, and they're not," he says. The site is soliciting writers again. Norman recently got the call. Since she stopped focusing on Medium, her career has blossomed , she wrote a book on medical treatment of women's pain, which is coming out next year from Nation Books , even as her health has declined from autoimmune ailments. "I've been trying not to die, frankly," she says. "I've really moved on to other things out of necessity." And yet. Medium hasn't solved the problem of publishing on the internet, but neither has anyone else. "I'll pitch them, because I've been invested all this time and I've hung on and hung on," she says. "I'd like to see how it all pans out. I'd like to see it through."

Google's artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo will face the world's top-ranked Go player, China's 19-year-old Ke Jie, in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI Photo: AFP/File tech Ready, set, Go! Rematch of man vs machine in ancient game Today 06:00 am JST 0 Comments By Dan Martin SHANGHAI It's man vs machine this week as Google's artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo faces the world's top-ranked Go player in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI. China's 19-year-old Ke Jie is given little chance in the three-game series beginning Tuesday in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen after AlphaGo stunned observers last year by trouncing South Korean grandmaster Lee Se-Dol four games to one. Lee's loss in Seoul marked the first time a computer programme had beaten a top player in a full match in the 3,000-year-old Chinese board game, and has been hailed as a landmark event in the development of AI. AI has previously beaten humans in cerebral contests, starting with IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, but AlphaGo's win last year is considered the most significant win for AI yet. Go is considered perhaps the most complex game ever devised, with an incomputable number of move options that puts a premium on "intuition." Proponents had considered it a bastion in which human thought would remain superior, at least for the foreseeable future. AlphaGo's triumph fuelled hopes of a brave new world in which AI is applied not only to driverless cars or "smart homes", but to helping mankind figure out some of the most complex scientific, technical, and medical problems. "AlphaGo's successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered," Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, said ahead of this week's matches. AI's ultimate goal is to create "general" or multi-purpose, rather than "narrow," task-specific intelligence -- something resembling human reasoning and the ability to learn. But for some, it conjures sci-fi images of a future in which machines "wake up" and enslave humanity. Physicist Stephen Hawking is a leading voice for caution, warning in 2015 that computers may outsmart humans, "potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand." Ke faces AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Ke is a brash prodigy who went pro at 11 years old, has been world number one for more than two years, and has described himself as a "pretentious prick". After AlphaGo flattened Lee, Ke declared he would never lose to the machine. "Bring it on," he said on China's Twitter-like Weibo. But he has tempered his bravado since then. Ke was among many top Chinese players who were trounced in online contests in January by a mysterious adversary who reportedly won 60 straight victories. That opponent -- cheekily calling itself "The Master" -- was later revealed by DeepMind to have been an updated AlphaGo. "Even that was not AlphaGo's best performance," Gu Li, a past national champion, told Chinese state media last week. "It would be very hard for Ke to play against it, but then again, Ke has also been working extremely hard to change his methods in preparation. I hope he can play well." Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid. The winner is the player who seals off the most territory. AlphaGo uses two sets of "deep neural networks" containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught -- having played millions of games against itself after initial programming. © 2017 AFP Great tours and adventures in Asia's four season playground Choose from hand-picked tours throughout Japan with professional guides in amazing destinations.

A quick Google, and you can find anything from “Great Gatsby” sweatshirts to Kurt Vonnegut-themed jewelry. But one of the coolest book-inspired creations I’ve come across in a while is a “Moby-Dick” inspired board game called “New Bedford: A Game of Historic Whaling and Town Building” created by a reader from Pennsylvania. “I'm inspired by the way books can sort of invisibly manipulate your thoughts,” game creator Nat Levan, 33, told me. “You have this direct access to characters' states of mind, which lets you experience the world through the characters. Games try to do something similar.” Levan — who grew up southeast Pennsylvania and majored in Aerospace Engineering at Virginia Tech — “hated Melville in high school” but when he reread Herman’s tome as an adult about five years ago, he was “enthralled. It sort of sat with me for a while,” he said. Just before that, he’d been reintroduced to the retro-awesomeness of old-school board games by some friends. The two new passions stewed together in his mind, and in 2015, a game publisher put on a call on Kickstarter. More than 2,000 people donated to help make “New Bedford.” “For a while, I thought of the game as a personal magnum opus, like ‘Moby-Dick,’” said Levan. “But part of my intent was making a game that wasn't just an adaption of the book. Of course, Moby-Dick has such enormous gravity that you can't create art about that time period without referencing it at least tangentially.” Once he decided to center the game on the setting of the book, rather than the plot, “that freed me up. I didn’t have to worry about whether I was being faithful to the book, but I could put in quotes and pulling from the book to sort of expand on the story I was telling.” For instance, on one game piece is the quote from Chapter 6: “But think not that this famous town has only harpooners… to show her visitors. Not at all…The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England…. You must go to New Bedford.” Set in the “Moby-Dick” era, your goal, matey, is to build the town New Bedford into “a thriving whaling community” by gathering resources — food, wood, bricks — selling goods, building buildings, docking ships and launching whaling ships. “Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don’t forget to pay your crew when the ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points.” Love it. Play with your friends next rainy day — or by yourself: the game is for one to five players. Not only is the game super fun — a cross between city-building games like Settlers of Catan and Monopoly — but I was blown away by how meticulously beautiful the game itself is: This is no factory-made, cheap plastic pop-out game; this is a gorgeous boutique board game — hand illustrated on thick card stock and heavy-duty cardboard, with crafted wooden game pieces and a sturdy canvass bag to store the pieces. A work of art, thanks to Michigan artist Nolan Nasser. Almost like a New Bedford Monopoly, “New Bedford” — and Levan’s extension game, sold separately, “Rising Tide” — boast game pieces crafted with careful attention to Melville-era New Bedford. You’ll see The Fairhaven Bridge, Tryworks, Candleworks, Mayor’s House, Custom House, Captain’s House, Chandlery, Salvage Yard and Newspaper, among other game pieces. Remarkably, “New Bedford” was the first board game Levan created — he’s since made about half a dozen games, including “Nantucket: A Historic Whaling and Town Building Game for Two," and the aforementioned “Rising Tide,” in which he “tried to reference as many events and quotes from the book as I could. And of course, I had to add a white whale.” As for his next book-inspired board game? “I just finished ‘Into Thin Air,’ by Jon Krakauer, about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. I was already working on designing a game about climbing Mount Everest, but reading the book gives me an entirely different angle on what I want players to experience.” Game can be purchased through Amazon or https://greaterthangames.com/store/new-bedford Lauren Daley is a freelance writer and book columnist.

Now, the moon is back at the center of efforts not only to explore space, but to create a permanent, independent space-faring society. Planning expeditions to Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor is no longer just a NASA effort, though the U.S. space agency has plans for a moon-orbiting space station that would serve as a staging ground for Mars missions in the early 2030s. The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is planning a lunar fueling station for spacecraft, capable of supporting 1,000 people living in space within 30 years. Trending: Enes Kanter Held in Romania: Turkish NBA Star Says Anti-Erdogan Views Got Passport Revoked Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Robert Bigelow all have companies aiming to deliver people or goods to the moon. Several teams competing for a share of Google’s US$30 million cash prize are planning to launch rovers to the moon. Black MoonMore The moon prior to the Penumbral Eclipse, Somerset, England, September 28, 2015. Russian aerospace designer Energia is planning to send space tourists on a flyby visit to the International Space Station (ISS). Matt Cardy/Getty We and 27 other students from around the world recently participated in the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge, proposing designs of what a lunar launch and supply station for deep space missions might look like, and how it would work. The Raw Materials for Rocket Fuel Right now all space missions are based on, and launched from, Earth. But Earth’s gravitational pull is strong. To escape Earth’s gravity, a rocket has to be traveling 11 kilometers a second–25,000 miles per hour! Any rocket leaving Earth has to carry all the fuel it will ever use to get to its destination and, if needed, back again. That fuel is heavy–and getting it moving at such high speeds takes a lot of energy. If we could refuel in orbit, that launch energy could lift more people or cargo or scientific equipment into orbit. Then the spacecraft could refuel in space, where Earth’s gravity is less powerful. The moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth, which makes it an attractive alternative base. The moon also has ice, which we already know how to process into a hydrogen-oxygen propellant that we use in many modern rockets. Roving Luna NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite missions have already found substantial amounts of ice in permanently shadowed craters on the moon. Don't miss: What Does Hassan Rouhani’s Victory Mean for the Iran Nuclear Deal? Those locations would be tricky to mine because they are colder and offer no sunlight to power roving vehicles. However, we could install big mirrors on the craters’ rims to illuminate solar panels in the permanently shadowed regions. Rovers from Google’s Lunar X Prize competition and NASA’s Lunar Resource Prospector, set to launch in 2020, would also contribute to finding good locations to mine ice. Imagining a Moon Base Depending on where the best ice reserves are, we might need to build several small robotic moon bases. Each one would mine ice, manufacture liquid propellant and transfer it to passing spacecraft. Our team developed plans to accomplish those tasks with three different types of rovers. Our plans also require a few small robotic shuttles to meet up with nearby deep-space mission vehicles in lunar orbit. One rover, which we call the Prospector, would explore the moon and find ice-bearing locations. A second rover, the Constructor, would follow along behind, building a launch pad and packing down roadways to ease movements for the third rover type, the Miners, which actually collect the ice and deliver it to nearby storage tanks and an electrolysis processing plant that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Read More The Constructor would also build a landing pad where the small near-moon transport spacecraft we call Lunar Resupply Shuttles would arrive to collect fuel for delivery as newly launched spacecraft pass by the moon. The shuttles would burn moon-made fuel and would have advanced guidance and navigation systems to travel between lunar bases and their target spacecraft. A Gas Station in Space When enough fuel is being produced, and the shuttle delivery system is tested and reliable, our plan calls for building a gas station in space. The shuttles would deliver ice directly to the orbiting fuel depot, where it would be processed into fuel and where rockets heading to Mars or elsewhere could dock to top up. The depot would have large solar arrays powering an electrolysis module for melting the ice and then turning the water into fuel, and large fuel tanks to store what’s made. NASA is already working on most of the technology needed for a depot like this, including docking and fuel transfer. We anticipate a working depot could be ready in the early 2030s, just in time for the first human missions to Mars. Most popular: Trump Receives Saudi Welcome As Scandal Brews at Home To be most useful and efficient, the depot should be located in a stable orbit relatively near both the Earth and the moon. The Earth-moon Lagrangian Point 1 (L1) is a point in space about 85 percent of the way from Earth to the moon, where the force of Earth’s gravity would exactly equal the force of the moon’s gravity pulling in the other direction. It’s the perfect pit stop for a spacecraft on its way to Mars or the outer planets. Leaving Earth Our team also found a fuel-efficient way to get spacecraft from Earth orbit to the depot at L1, requiring even less launch fuel and freeing up more lift energy for cargo items. First, the spacecraft would launch from Earth into Low Earth Orbit with an empty propellant tank. Then, the spacecraft and its cargo could be towed from Low Earth Orbit to the depot at L1 using a solar electric propulsion tug, a spacecraft largely propelled by solar-powered electric thrusters. This would let us triple the payload delivery to Mars. At present, a human Mars mission is estimated to cost as much as US$100 billion, and will need hundreds of tons of cargo. Delivering more cargo from Earth to Mars with fewer rocket launches would save billions of dollars and years of time. A Base for Space Exploration Building a gas station between Earth and the moon would also reduce costs for missions beyond Mars. NASA is looking for extraterrestrial life on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. Future spacecraft could carry much more cargo if they could refuel in space–who knows what scientific discoveries sending large exploration vehicles to these moons could enable? By helping us escape both Earth’s gravity and dependence on its resources, a lunar gas station could be the first small step toward the giant leap into making humanity an interplanetary civilization.

Taps and gestures on the BLOCKS turn into musical rhythms when paired to the iOS 'NOISE' app. Now ROLI is making the NOISE app available for Android as well, but it has some limitations. ROLI first showed off the Android NOISE app at Google I/O before the main presentation began, where a single block was connected to a Google Pixel. Now the app is available on the Play Store for anyone to use - as long as you have a compatible device. ROLI is only allowing devices with 'Pro Audio' to run the app, which the company defines as "a set of requirements that handle complex audio data in real time." Right now, only the Google Pixel/Pixel XL and Galaxy S8 are verified to run the app, but the company is testing more devices.    As you might expect from a beta, the NOISE Android app doesn't yet have all the features of the iOS application. You can use it without the extra BLOCKS too, if you just want to try it out.

New alliances are forming almost every day as companies without a traditional foothold in the automotive space try to get a slice of the pie. Google is working with Fiat Chrysler on self-driving cars while making next-generation display systems for Volvo; new software startups like Otonomo are shelling out their services to major companies like Daimler; and BMW is partnering with companies like Intel on data collection. Panasonic is just one of many players collaborating with the auto industry to focus on vehicles of the future. "Our business has evolved over a period of time, especially in the recent past of going from purely a consumer business to a B2B business," Tom Gebhardt, chairman and CEO of Panasonic's North American operations, told Business Insider. "There's a number of reasons for that: The commoditization of consumer products [and] the unfavorability in some of the cost models led us to look for better values in-vehicle technologies," he continued. Working with Tesla and Google PanasonicPrior to taking over Panasonic's North American division in April, Gebhardt led the company's automotive division for five years.  Placing an executive with several years of automotive expertise at the helm of North American operations says something about the company's pivot from consumer electronics to auto tech. That larger cultural shift came from Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga when he took over in 2012. As Forbes details in a 2016 profile, Tsuga was key to transitioning Panasonic from its failing plasma TV business to other revenue streams, like in-flight entertainment systems in planes and electric cars. Panasonic isn't stretching too far from its roots when it comes to this kind of vehicle tech. Gebhardt noted that Panasonic had a presence in the car radio business starting in 2008, giving it a natural introduction to multimedia displays with its electronics background. Gebhardt said Panasonic is channeling resources toward digital cockpits and vehicle entertainment systems as self-driving vehicles become more in reach. "If the scenario says the car drives itself, it’s similar to sitting in an airplane seat because you’re no longer actively driving," he said. "We see that as an evolution of the space that’s quite interesting going forward that has infinite possibilities for us." Screenshot As an extension of that plan, Panasonic recently worked with Fiat Chrysler on its semi-autonomous Portal concept car shown off at CES in January. The concept featured electronics like an OLED touchscreen with facial and voice recognition. Panasonic sees itself playing a role in fully autonomous cars as well by developing mobile offices or televisions specifically for self-driving cars, Gebhardt said. Perhaps more notable is Panasonic's relationship with Telsa. As one of the largest battery manufacturers in the world, competing with the likes of LG Chem and Samsung SDI, Panasonic had an easy entry into the electric vehicle space. The company plans to invest $1.6 billion in Tesla's Gigafactory. "The future is definitely electric, no question in my mind, it’s more of, 'what is the future timeline?' Is it 10 years, 15 years, 40 years?" Gebhardt said. "We don’t see an alternative more interesting that, it’s just a matter of what the adoption hits at the scale that makes this a slam dunk." YouTube/Matthew Roberts But, there are hurdles to overcome in both these spaces. From the connected vehicle side, consumer adoption of infotainment systems is still lagging. J.D. Power led a 2016 study that found that more than 50% of car owners never used their in-vehicle displays after 90 days of purchase, preferring the ease of using their smartphones. But the tech is still in its first-generation, Gebhardt said, adding adoption will improve with the technology. Google's new Android display, for example, will integrate its smart voice assistant to encourage usage while driving. "Any time you’re dealing with a first generation product, a user is not going to be overly comfortable," he said. As for electric cars, vehicle adoption in the US is still tepid, and global sales hover at 1%. Gebhardt acknowledged adoption is slow in the US, particularly due to low gas prices — a trend that is likely to persist if Trump comes through on his promise to roll back fuel emissions standards. He said, however, that this is likely a "short-term problem." While the US market is slow to progress, there's still hope when it comes to China, which is making a concerted effort to incentivize battery-powered vehicles. China "being the largest car market in the world has a big influence on what will happen," Gebhardt said. "If they adopt in a big way, that changes the balance of where electric is today versus where it will be going." Panasonic has made some heavy investments in nascent areas, but expects to see a return on investment soon. Tsuga recently said Panasonic is expecting an increase in net profit in fiscal year 2017, its first gain in two years, because of new bets on transit, Nikkei Asian Review reported. "We're pretty bullish on the fact that this is a space that will continue to grow and there’s value there," Gebhardt said.

Photo by David Allen By David Allen, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin Posted: 05/20/17, 10:36 AM PDT | Updated: 1 day ago # Comments Richard Nixon, the ultimate comeback kid, is trending. Google “Trump Nixon” and you got 26.1 million results Friday, up 1.3 million from the day before. Comparisons between the 45th and 37th presidents abound: Both disliked the press, chafed against the Establishment, distrusted the FBI, nursed grievances, railed against their enemies, complained about witch hunts and fired officials investigating their administrations. After Trump sent FBI Director James Comey packing, a cheeky tweet from the Nixon Library went viral: “FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI. #FBIDirector #notNixonian.” (The library clarified, however, that Nixon did order the firing of the Watergate special prosecutor, and that the attorney general and deputy attorney general both quit rather than carry out the order. And the National Archives apologized for the tweet.) With the Tricky One in the headlines again, this seemed like the perfect time to leave the Inland Valley for a place that is unquestionably Nixonian: the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. Opened in 1990, the library was built on a former citrus grove around the modest Yorba Linda home where the future president was born — possible first words: “I am not a daughter” — and spent his first nine years. I’d been there once, 20 years ago, with two friends on our way to a wedding. They remember little more than the lush grounds; all I can summon up are the bronzes of Nixon with various foreign leaders and a small, defensive Watergate exhibit. (To be fair, that’s more than I remember about the wedding.) When the National Archives took control from the private Nixon Foundation in 2007, the Watergate section was beefed up, and the entire museum got a $15 million overhaul completed last October. There’s no pussyfooting around: The 12-minute introductory film begins with Watergate and Nixon’s resignation. “He was ground down by his own flaws,” one commentator opines. Which president is this about again? “He was the biggest loser in American politics,” Pat Buchanan, a former adviser, says as footage of Nixon’s first inauguration plays, “and here he was taking the oath of office. People could not believe it.” Disbelief about the man being sworn in? Huh. To explain the “loser” comment, Nixon had lost the 1960 presidential election and then the 1962 California governor’s race, after which he told reporters they wouldn’t have him to kick around anymore (not that he was bitter) because that would be his last press conference. Thus his astonishing comeback in 1968. Advertisement He is the only native Californian ever elected president, Reagan having been born in Illinois. Pomona, by the way, is where Nixon launched his first three campaigns, all successful: for Congress in 1946, for U.S. Senate in 1949 and as vice presidential nominee in 1952. The museum proper begins with a bang, in the middle of the story: Not Nixon’s birth in far-away 1913 but in the turbulence of the 1960s — protests and political assassinations — culminating in the election of a law-and-order president. From there you can step into a replica of the Nixon Oval Office, and even wander around it and sit behind the desk, unlike at other roped-off presidential libraries. Anti-war protests, Kent State and Vietnam are covered, as is the Apollo program. I picked up a green rotary phone and heard Nixon’s conversation with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin from the moon July 20, 1969. We learn about the anti-communist’s visit to China and about his domestic achievements, which include creating the Environmental Protection Agency, signing the Clean Air Act and Title IX into law, ending the draft and lowering the voting age to 18. We see examples of Nixon in popular culture, including, yes, the Nixon-Elvis photo that had its own moment a few years ago. You don’t get much insight into why so many people hated him, but the detailed look at the four years it took to extricate ourselves from the war provides a clue. The Watergate exhibit is the most detailed, covering multiple acts of political sabotage against perceived political enemies and leakers even before the break-in. You can press buttons on a schematic of the White House to see the location of microphones in Nixon’s taping system — has anyone from the current administration asked for a copy? — and listen to suspicious clicks that probably show erasures in the notorious 18 1/2-minute gap in one Watergate tape. Facing impeachment, Nixon resigned Aug. 9, 1974. You can exit the museum and tour the helicopter that brought him back to California in disgrace, and even pose for a photo on the step giving a full-arm wave goodbye. Nixon Foundation spokesman Joe Lopez told me the museum’s revamp “allows people to think critically” about Nixon’s legacy. I asked what he thought of Nixon making so much news in 2017. “Having a president who’s been out of office more than 40 years, and deceased for more than 20 years, and he’s still drawing that kind of attention, we enjoy that,” Lopez said with a smile. “It brings visitors in.” I was one. And the museum provided plenty of food for thought. Do the parallels between Trump and Nixon do more discredit to Trump or Nixon, and why? Discuss. Is history repeating itself? Maybe, maybe not. If it is, it’s certainly more compressed this time around. Watergate lasted two years. The main points so far of Comeygate occurred within eight days. It’s like Watergate as a Vine loop. Reflecting on his life in 1990, Nixon said, “It’s a long way from Yorba Linda to the White House.” As a visit to the Nixon Library this very strange spring shows, the distance may not be so great.

The ROLI NOISE sound production app is now in early access for Android Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/21 9:11am PDTMay 21, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 63 Share on Twitter Total Shares109 Applications News Videos ROLI's modular BLOCKS studio has gained popularity recently, as a way to easily create music. Taps and gestures on the BLOCKS turn into musical rhythms when paired to the iOS 'NOISE' app. Now ROLI is making the NOISE app available for Android as well, but it has some limitations. ROLI first showed off the Android NOISE app at Google I/O before the main presentation began, where a single block was connected to a Google Pixel. Now the app is available on the Play Store for anyone to use - as long as you have a compatible device. ROLI is only allowing devices with 'Pro Audio' to run the app, which the company defines as "a set of requirements that handle complex audio data in real time." Right now, only the Google Pixel/Pixel XL and Galaxy S8 are verified to run the app, but the company is testing more devices.    As you might expect from a beta, the NOISE Android app doesn't yet have all the features of the iOS application. You can use it without the extra BLOCKS too, if you just want to try it out.

At the same time, Android O includes a new battery settings menu that attempts to present your usage in a more understandable way. Instead of simply showing how much juice an app used, it puts battery use in the context of how you use the phone. When you see an app at the top of your Nougat battery stats, it's not always clear if that's because you used it a lot (so you'd expect it to be high) or the app is just doing something it shouldn't be doing.  In Android O, the main list of battery users indicates the amount of drain as a percent and the amount of time you actually used it. You can drill down even further by tapping on one of the apps in your list. This battery usage screen tells you how much of its battery usage happened in the background and how much while you were actively using the app. So, something like Pokemon GO would be at the top of your battery usage list, but this menu makes it clear most of that usage occurred while you were actively playing the game. Plus, you can see how long it was used. It really helps put battery drain in context. At the top of the usage stats for individual apps are buttons to force stop and disable/uninstall. At the bottom are helpful links for battery optimization and background activity settings. This all applies to mostly stock phones. Samsung, LG, and the others will probably swap in their own battery stats. Tags android o battery feature spotlight Google io17 io2017 series_android_o_feature_spotlights video subscribe ...

Suicide_Note Perhaps you could explain to the rest of us why your comment sucks so hard? F4LL0U7 Does it? Justin W It does. F4LL0U7 Well, sorry to have wasted your time. I guess my days of commenting are over. Geoff Johnson What's wrong with wanting to clear all cache at the same time? Jordan L I noticed the all app cache clear missing too. Interestingly, if you search for Cache in settings it sends you to the Storage menu, but Cache is not a category. F4LL0U7 Yeah, I noticed that too. I'm wondering if they just forgot to implement it, or maybe it will eventually become part of the "free up space" functionality. Steve_Jobroni Perhaps you can explain to us why your mom sucks so hard. RiftSilver Much better than the old battery menu that was just "Battery Usage: Screen 67%" Evan Jenkins Plus you can restrict apps from running in the background :D. I mean it might break my phone but by restricting most of apps, I feel like my standby time is better (it's only been a day so it's not LEGIT or anything) and I haven't felt any negative repercussions yet, so fingers crossed mxwp "Samsung, LG, and the others will probably swap in their own battery stats." hmm, so you wouldn't be able to tell which of their bloatware is eating away at your battery? Conspiracy! C-o-n-spiracy! Roh_Mish My phone has the stock battery stats viewer (although Sony adds an additional click) but I think all devices musy have the Android viewer L+ Mkvarner Well. Samsung and LG phones usually have better battery than Pixel/Nexus with the same battery size and better specs. David Hyman Does it persist for more than one day or after a full charge? That's my biggest complaint right now. I only realize that I have a big battery problem when it is too late to dive into the details. I would really like to see it over a longer period of time to see which apps are systemic issues vs just a busy day on FB enoch861 My trick for this is to never fully charge the battery. Get between 95-99% and unplug. This way the stats never reset and you're able to keep track of things over a few days. David Hyman That would work but seems like a hack that shouldn't be necessary Stu The new info seems useful. I liked the nougat battery graph though, wish they'd kept it. Leif Sikorski What we need is more help with Google Play Services, Android OS and all kind of wakeups going crazy. hunter2 Exactly, the issue was never that we didn't have enough details about what a specific app was doing. Breaking down the specifics of how Gmail used it's 4% isn't going to help me figure out what's causing Play Services and Android OS to be using 40%. On top of that, it's pretty common for the app usage to not add up to the actual used percentage. So, for example, the battery will be at 50% but when you add up all the usage it's only in the high 20's. AbdulB1 Only solution is bigger battery..... period raffr Android O is making me even more excited for the Pixel 2! Hopefully the next pixel will be water resistant and less ugly. Roy It will:) Ash But you still believe it will be ugly 😁 Nope.jpeg The ability to disable any app from running in the background would be nice. That way it would only be used whenever I opened it. JW I'm just happy to see the big battery percentage in the status bar. Finally. el_smurfo Once you notice it's a different font than the clock, it will bug you more than make you happy. Rod Omfg! Can't believe we'll have decently detailed battery usage info Jim Why don't they just hire somebody from Apple to teach them how to do it? My wife's iPhone NEVER has an issue with apps running in the background and draining her battery. hunter2 But are you also OK with needing to remember to periodically launch Google Photos to make sure recent pics back up, or periodically launch spotify when you're on Wifi so live playlists that you have set to download (like discover weekly) download while on wifi? Apple obviously has better standby and background usage, but there are tangible downsides. ChrisNacca This ^ instinct Yeah, the Google Photos is a major bummer. It's so nice not to have to worry about them backing up when it just does it. johdaxx She should really upgrade from iOS 6 then... el_smurfo I do miss the graph showing your signal level. It's hard to be upset with battery life when you're in an area that shows all red for signal. Christopher Bement >4 days left. Fucking. Hate. You. John $50 says they exempt Google Play Services from the list of apps you can see. It's by far the biggest cause of idle battery drain for me. Fix your own damn apps before casting blame, Google. Imparus Look into what the Google play service do and what it handle. If your play service is using that much battery, then you probably have some third party app that keep asking for high precision, which mean if you have GPS on those app will consume a lot of power, but the one you see using this power will be the play service. Dennis Ulijn Don't you honestly see ANY problem in your explanation? If 'some third party app' asks for my location, i want to see the battery usage going to 'some third party app', because uninstalling 'some third party app' is the solution to the battery drain. I will NEVER know what app is causing Google Play Services to go 'rogue' without uninstalling one app and waiting for a few hours or a day before i know if that was the culprit. And to think that i actually know what i'm doing, remind yourself of how many capable users are constantly getting flack on Android choices because the general public has absolutely no idea why their phone dies so quickly. And there's no simple way for them to find out. If an app on in the foreground, the screen usage should be attributed to that app. If it uses bluetooth in the background, it should be attributed to that app. If it uses my location, that app. If it has wake locks, CPU is for that app. Then, and ONLY then, can you objectively say what drains your battery. Screen usage is a good statistic, but if your battery dies because it's on the home screen 90% of the time, you know you can set screen-off timer to a shorter time, or change your behavior. Imparus "Google Play Services from the list of apps you can see. It's by far the biggest cause of idle battery drain for me. Fix your own damn apps before casting blame, Google." Is the comment I responded to, the person is complaining about the power usage of the Play service. Whatever or not you can actually see the usage of the play service doesn't change that. What you want is to see how much each app use of the play service, but that isn't simple to do. Say we have 2 apps that use location, both of these apps will ask the Play service for location, the play service will perform one call to lets say the GPS and that will be what both of the apps will get(if they have the same frequency set). So which app do you put as the one using the power? That is the problem and why you can't easily say which uses the power. They can and already does inform of the precision different apps ask for, which you can see under location, since app that ask for high precision uses more power. They could show how often an app is asking the Play service for some, but it is hard to actually turning it into concrete power usage by the individual app. "And to think that i actually know what i'm doing, remind yourself of how many capable users are constantly getting flack on Android choices because the general public has absolutely no idea why their phone dies so quickly. " When you say you know what you are doing, I assume you mean that just in general, cause you don’t seem to understand how the play service actually work, and how it is actually used by other apps. You can't easily inform the user of what exactly is using the power, and what I responded to was someone saying the play service is terrible for battery, when it is some 3rd party app/apps that is actually the problem. It could therefor make sense to hide it from the user, since they don't understand that, and it is hard to say precisely how much each app contribute to it, but the changes in O for background task, should fix a lot of the drains third party apps can or will do. Dennis Ulijn What i mean with 'i know what i'm doing' is that i can find out what apps use up battery (though i don't want to go through the trouble of rooting like i have done before). The fact that it isn't a simple solution tells me nothing. I don't expect to google only picking up the easy to solve issues. If 2 apps ask play services for location, attribute half of the power usage of location services. I play services asks for location 100 times, and one app asks for it 99 times, attribute 99% of the power usage to that app. If android wants to know your location 99 times for google fit, attribute to fit. For 'find my device', show find my device. IF it's for google's database knowledge about you, show that... I don't want a black box where i have to open up my device in all sorts of ways to know where battery percentage goes to. If CPU is used to scan apps, show me play store protect in the battery usage screen... It's really not that hard, and geleralizing all 'hard to split' usages and lumping them in google play services only yields pissed off reviews in the play store of people who 1. don't get why play services is suddenly installed without them knowing, 2. don't get why it's so big and suddenly they have no storage left and 3. don't get why their battery is draining when they don't even know what it's doing. It's not that i don't know what it does, it's that i look at it from a tech illiterate view. We should all learn to see android as a system for everybody instead of a system for power users, and realize that not everybody knows how to curb play services's enthusiasm of draining batteries only to know more about the users. Things like this make people flock to iPhones and say that they should have made the choice sooner, because everything is clear. No 'service' that drains battery without you knowing what it does. I rather have them lump it under system than saying it's "just services" Imparus Power consumption aren't that simple, some location request use more power even thought it is the same type of precision requested. There is also the problem that battery consumption measured aren't fully accurate, and splitting is fine when you have few apps, but if you have many apps that use location, then it will not make it much easier to locate. The thing is as long as an app is requesting coarse location, even if it makes a lot of request, it doesn't use that much battery, so if you want to know what app is using all your battery looking at apps that request high precision even thought they don't need it. "It's not that i don't know what it does, it's that i look at it from a tech illiterate view." They don't look at battery stats "Things like this make people flock to iPhones and say that they should have made the choice sooner, because everything is clear." You get none of this information, so if you want to go the iOS way you hide the play service. " No 'service' that drains battery without you knowing what it does. I rather have them lump it under system than saying it's "just services"" Then you are on the opposite side of John, and it is him you need to discuss it with. You are ignoring the fact that the Play service possible high placement is changing with how background task is working, so you are talking about making a solution to something that wont be a problem. John It's not using a lot but it's the ONLY cause of idle battery drain on my minimalist tablet. I have no messengers, no email, no background syncing, and no notifications. I am continuing to test but it's almost certainly not a third-party app causing the wakelocks. I highly suspect it's Play Services itself occasionally making process calls. Maybe it's unavoidable but (1) it should be disclosed as a battery drain, and (2) it didn't do this in the old days, meaning Google added services that require wakelocks. Vratislav Jindra Just because you don't know what Play Services are for and why they show up so high in the list doesn't mean they need to be fixed. Loved Yes. They need to be fixed. If the op doesn't know, then maybe play services should explain themselves clear and tell which app invoked it's wake lock and such stuff. Dennis Ulijn Please explain. What could cause Play Services to show up so high on the list for Play services' doing, instead of other apps doings? Loved I'll bet $5000 chandrizzle The problem is Google Play Services isn't a single app. It's a service that all apps can call upon (if the app dev enables it) for data updates. There's a possibility that it's not even a Google app that's causing the drain if you have an installed app that's using it incorrectly. At the very least, that is my understanding of how GPS works (The Google one, not Global Positioning System). Ed. Blake Battery graphic and usage stats still present? ddevito When a major feature of every Android update is centered around "optimizations" and "improved battery life" and it never amounts to anything... Then you know you have a major problem. Tony Kuligowski How do you see your signal data in battery stats now? Travis About time they added native, user-facing battery percentage option to stock. (I know it was a developer option forever but it was buggy and not exactly easy for an average user to find) Teja Finally, an option to enable battery percentage in status bar. Why do people not care about that? When I was using nexus I always used an app to do that. Dennis Ulijn People DO, and they are not liking it. Before (on pixel/nexus) you could display percentage INSIDE the battery indicator. That saved space (and power users love information density). I think the battery percentage next to the battery icon is better for legibility, but i don't like the condensed font next to the medium font of the clock, and the blocky font of the LTE symbol... That's just inconsistency. That's why i will leave it off, and open the notification drawer for precise information. Teja In that case, replacing the battery indicator with the battery percentage would be nice like what I've been doing on my Oxygen OS. Madis Seems good, but they should've kept the history graph. Michał Jakubowski Wow, they finally added a way to block app's background activity without root, xposed, app ops, etc.? (look at the bottom of the third screen from hero image).

Think telegraph! Yep, before the Google Keyboard and swipe input, there was Morse code. Siemens & Halske was founded in 1847 to improve on that - instead of dots and dashes, the new machine used needles to point at letters. A primitive screen but still an improvement. The companys entry to the world of telephony came 150 years later - the Siemens Mobiltelefon C1 from 1985 was a car phone that worked over VHF. Siemens Mobiltelefon C1 Many companies got their start making phones for cars - given the weights and sizes involved, those were certainly not pocketable devices. Motorola made radios for motor cars and that radio expertise eventually led to the first commercially available cellular telephone. You may hear cellular phone or cell phone and think nothing of it. But cell refers to cell towers, before that voice communication was device to device, basically like a walkie talkie. The Motorola DynaTAC 8000x used the AMPS network - aka 1G - which transmitted analog audio to cell towers. That greatly improved the range since your call can hop between multiple cell towers until it found its destination. Motorola DynaTAC 8000X (photos by Redrum0486 and Rico Shen) Nokia got its start in 1865 as a paper mill (most people back then communicated with letters written on paper, not touchscreens). Eventually, the company went into making cables for telephones and then wireless networking equipment. Along the way, it also made phones to use those networks. The first-ever GSM call - aka 2G - was made in 1991 on a network built by Telenokia and Siemens (now just Nokia Networks). GSM was a digital network, offering better audio quality and text messaging. So the next year, the first SMS was sent. That new, cutting-edge network needed a phone. The first mass-produced GSM phone was the Nokia 1011. It could store 99 phone numbers and send and receive texts. Note that the 1011 was introduced in 1992, the first GSM call was made with test equipment instead. GSM had provisions to connect computers to the Internet on the go, but phones themselves had no knowledge of the world wide web. Yet. Things started to change in 1998 when Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson and Unwired Planet founded the WAP Forum. A poor facsimile of the true WWW, WAP nevertheless gave people untethered access to their favorite sites. The first people to experience this are the ones that bought a Nokia 7110. Nokia 1011 (photo by Jkbw)  Nokia 7110 Ericsson, by the way, also has a long history in telephony and networking equipment. The company is so old, that it was the first to combine the earpiece and mouthpiece into a single handle - they used to be held separately! Ericsson brought that innovation to the public in 1892 with The Dachshund. But it was the Ericsson DBH 1001 - the first phone made of Bakelite - that defines what many of us think a phone looks like. Of course, now its mostly in iconography rather than a physical device. Ericsson's The Dachshund (photo by Birmingham Museums Trust)  The Bakelite Phone (Ericsson DBH 1001) (photo by Holger.Ellgaard) Anyway, 2G networks around the world are riding off into the sunset now. And with talk of 5G, the 3G networks are probably looking forward to retirement as well. Related articles Counterclockwise: how big can mini phones get?

He suggested doing something that had never been done before and could potentially upend the $350 billion telecom market. "It can't be so difficult to build our own system," the engineer said, referring to the telecom equipment that sends data across cables and wireless networks, and which the engineer suspected could be made to operate faster and cheaper than the pricey equipment sold by big vendors like Nortel, Huawei, Ericsson, Cisco or Juniper Networks. The engineer was suggesting building the telecom industry's first "white box" transponder, made with off-the-shelf parts such as chips from Broadcom and Acacia Communications, optical equipment from Lumentum, and software from one of the many new networking startups cropping up these days. Facebook's director of engineering Hans-Juergen Schmidtke, who was among those on the couch that day, was at first a naysayer. "I was a little bit skeptical about it at the time," he recounted to Business Insider. As a former engineer at Juniper Networks, Schmidtke knew from experience that building telecom equipment systems was an expensive undertaking that involved hiring teams of specially trained engineers and sizeable R&D budgets.  "Building a system ten years ago was like building a new company," Schmidtke said.  Still, Schmidtke agreed to help this tiny group hack together a white box system at one of Facebook's famous hackathons. Three months later they had a working prototype. Six months later, on November 1, they announced it to the world as a real product called Voyager.  The product’s unveiling sent shockwaves through the telecom industry, putting gear makers on notice that the lucrative market they controlled for decades was about to get turned upside down — and not necessarily to their advantage. While the effort is essentially a side-project for Facebook, a social networking company whose bread-and-butter business is online advertising, the stakes could not be higher for the telecom equipment companies which risk seeing their specialized products reduced to interchangeable commodities and their influence diminished.  For the industry’s established companies, there’s unease about Facebook’s growing clout and its ultimate intentions. But in a sign of how serious Facebook’s foray is being taken, there’s already a recognition by some that the repercussions could be even more painful it they don’t adapt. Voyager has already been tested by Facebook and European telecom company Telia over Telia’s thousand-kilometer-telecom network. Plus, German telecom equipment maker ADVA Optical Networking is manufacturing the device and, as of a few weeks ago had nine customers trying it out for their telecom needs, a mix of big telecom companies and enterprises, it said. And Paris based telecom provider, Orange is also testing the device, working with Equinix and African telecom company MTN. "We pulled it off essentially showing that when a few engineers can build a system within six months, the world has changed," Schmidtke said. One person told us that Schmidtke, who is insanely proud of Voyager, has become a star in his own corner of the tech world. When he and his team "go to conferences, they treat him like a tech celebrity, like a rock band," that person said. From one cult to another Voyager was the first product, and a major proving point, for Facebook's young Telecom Infrastructure Project (TIP), a consortium led by Facebook and launched at the industry's worldwide gathering, Mobile World Congress, on February 21, 2016. FacebookTIP is a spin-off from a similar organization Facebook launched a few years ago called the Open Compute Project (OCP). Facebook launched OCP and TIP because it had to take control over the technology it uses to support over 1.8 billion people uploading billions of photos, videos and updates every day. It has been designing its own IT equipment for years, things like computer servers, hard drives/storage systems and data center networks. Its versions were cheaper to build and easier to maintain than standard gear made by companies like Dell, HP, EMC and Cisco, it says.  Lots of big internet companies build their own tech, including Amazon and Google. But Facebook is unusual in that it openly shares all the designs, literally gives them all away for free, inviting anyone at any other company to come work on them, with contract manufacturers standing by to sell it all. It's a concept called open source hardware. In this way, Facebook gets lots of help in maintaining and advancing its infrastructure. And the rest of the world gets access to tech designed to work in the most demanding circumstances, like at a huge internet company. OCP has radically changed the data center tech industry and those involved say it has created a cult-like following. For instance, when secretive Apple refused to join OCP to let its IT engineers collaborate with others, it's crew of network engineers quit their jobs. They turned around and launched a startup called SnapRoute and built network software for the OCP community, the story goes. Apple later joined OCP. SnapRoute wound up being the software chosen for Voyager. OCP created so much competetion for hardware vendors like Hewlett Packard and Dell that they opted to join the organization and embrace the white box concept. The alternative was to be squeezed out of selling their products to companies with the biggest and fastest-growing data centers in the world, not just Facebook, but Microsoft, Goldman Sachs and dozens of others. There was just one major area that had been somewhat left out of OCP's free and open source hardware revolution, the telecommunications part. That's the equipment that connects homes, businesses and data centers together across long distances, via undersea cables, wireless networks, and so on. FacebookAnd the big telecom companies, those that spend millions of dollars a year on this gear, wanted in. They needed an OCP of their own, Facebook discovered when it launched its Internet.org, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's project to bring internet to underdeveloped countries. "As we were thinking about Internet.org and helping get more people connected, the idea was, we're doing this thing called OCP to help the data center community to build infrastructure that's more efficient, more cost effective, that's greener and more sustainable, more flexible. And we said, can we do that for the telco industry?" said Facebook's VP of engineering Jay Parikh. "Facebook, having learned from OCP, comes in and says, we can play maybe a catalyzing function," Parikh said, describing early meetings he and his crew had at Mobile World Congress. "We're investing our people and our dollars into technology that is going to solve these problems and we're going to contribute that technology, that IP [intellectual property] into the ecosystem so that you all can benefit from this." Voyager is one big example. "That's something we developed and it's like, wow, we actually solved a problem that a bunch of operators seem to be struggling with," he said. Signing on huge partners South Korea Telecom's CTO Alex Choi agrees that telecom operators like SKT want faster, cheaper and more open equipment and were inspired by Facebook to take it into their own hands. Mobile World Live"The idea all started from Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg was always addressing the importance of connecting the unconnected," Choi said.  In 2015 and 2016, Zuckerberg came to the MWC conference, gave keynote speeches and hung out with top telecom executives. He wanted to know what was keeping those people off the internet. He discovered that bringing telecom services to far-out parts of the world "was too expensive," for telecom operators, Choi recalls. Facebook wanted to help bring the costs down. But developed nations in Europe, Asia and the Americas had the same problem. People are buying more devices, using more video. And with the Internet of Things, millions more objects are joining the internet daily, communicating over telecom networks. "There's a huge growing traffic demand. That means we have to install more base stations, find more sites, invest more in the fiber and the backbone and supporting IT infrastructure," Choi said. But telcos can't charge more to cover the costs. People are are pushing them to charge less, for unlimited data plans. David Ramos/Getty ImagesWhile Zuck didn't do the actual recruiting to get TIP off the ground, he "inspired people" Choi said. When Facebook executives approached him about forming the new organization, (including Aaron Bernstein, responsible for partnerships with mobile providers, and Jason Taylor, Facebook's vice resident of infrastructure who leads OCP), Choi liked the idea so much, he became the chairman of the TIP organization. It felt revolutionary. OCP has invented lots of cool new hardware for the data center and telecom operators had never banded together to build their own gear, he said. "Operators rely too much on the big telco incumbent vendors. We kept pushing the vendors to do more innovations, to do something to bring down their premium price tag. They are making efforts and making progress but not as fast as we want them to be. So what can you do? You explore other opportunities," he said. Deutsche Telekom's Axel Clauberg was in a similar boat. He first got in touch with Facebook in 2015 about participating with OCP's networking efforts. There had been a push for more telcos to join OCP at that time because Facebook has been helping usher in a new way to build computer networks. It takes all the fancy, complex features out of the hardware and put them into software. In the corporate network world this push is called software-defined networking (SDN). But it's happening in the telecom service provider world, too, where its called Network Function Virtualization or NFV. Facebook didn't invent SDN or NFV, but in the slow and conservative world of network engineering, OCP and TIP are radically pushing these concepts forward. OCP is proving the technology works even for a huge demanding internet site like Facebook or for a giant telecom network like AT&T. "We are facing exponential traffic growth," explains DT's Clauberg. "We needed to do something." And there's one more issue going on besides tight budgets and huge growth, he said: the war for talent. Decades ago, hardware and communications engineers went to the telcos to build amazing new things, like mobile networks. Then they went to the tech companies like Cisco to build the tech that created the internet. Today, they are going directly to the internet companies like Google and Facebook and creating new hardware so they don't have to rely on the vendors, he said. TIP gives them a way to access the smartest minds, without having to poach them. "When [engineers] come out of the universities, which companies are they looking at? In old days, it was the telcos, then it was the suppliers, now it's the internet companies. The funny thing is with OCP, you have all these parties working together. I envision achieving the same [with TIP]. So having players from internet companies, from startups and established vendors, and the telcos, working together on what the infrastructure of the future should look like." DT's Clauberg joined TIP as a founding board member, alongside SKT's Choi. This was a powerful first step. SDK and DT are two of the most advanced telcos in the world, role models for many others. Facebook also convinced Intel's Caroline Chan to join TIP, which was an easy sell. Intel is also a founding member of OCP. And TIP was off and running. But there was one surprise founding member of TIP: Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec. The brave choice of Nokia Telecom devices that can be put together with standard parts and software are deeply threatening to the multibillion telecom equipment market dominated by companies like Huawei Technologies, Ericsson, Cisco, ZTE, and Nokia. YouTube/GEN15And Voyager isn't the only product. TIP's OpenCellular project is working on an open source 4G LTE/LTE base station, the hardware and the software.    As SKT's Choi describes it, TIP wants to "democratize" the technology, making it easier for anyone to build, use, or modify. That means taking it out of the hands of the equipment providers who create proprietary radios and base stations today. TIP's impact won't happen overnight, explains analyst Rohit Mehra, vice president of IDC's Network Infrastructure practice. But the goal is clear: to overhaul the telecom equipment industry which he says is about a $350 billion market today, when factoring in software, hardware and services. "This is not the first time Facebook has done this. They've been somewhat successful with what they call OCP," Mehra says. "The Telecom Infrastructure Project is disruptive not just to telecom equipment makers but in some cases the telecom service providers. Though in some cases it helps the service providers because it intends to give them more cost-effective infrastructure." So TIP is, in some ways, threatening Nokia's main telecom business. But Nokia is a close partner of Facebook and the one telecom equipment vendor embracing TIP as a founding member and board member. Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec explains why, via an adaptation of Abraham Lincoln's famous quote. "The best way to predict the future is to invent it," he tells Business Insider. "You have all these equipment makers saying, 'The world is changing so let's try to hold on to what we know.' But the thing is that the world is changing anyway, so it's much better to take an active role in shaping the future." If all goes well, TIP and Facebook will actually help create new customers using new telecom services, those people in undeveloped nations that never had telecom or internet, Le Gourrierec believes. "So it's best to participate in the definition of new partnerships, new services in partnership with the existing actors in addition to the new ones," Le Gourrierec said. From spies to community members When Facebook created Voyager, Nokia didn't shake in fear. Engineers there thought, "Maybe we can learn something for this," Le Gourrierec said. But there are other equipment makers who are, technically, part of TIP too. Currently the organization boasts over 100 members from all facets of the industry.  But Choi, Clauberg and Le Gourrierec said that many of them have only been nervously watching the group so far. Nokia"They are not actively contributing," Le Gourrierec said. Obviously, the kumbaya concept of open source doesn't work well like that. Everyone has to contribute their ideas for a community to blossom. One way that TIP is encouraging them to jump in is a different approach to sharing intellectual property. Participants don't have to share all their closely held, lucrative ideas and secrets for free like they do with OCP, or with other open source organizations, like Linux. Each working group in TIP can instead decide to use an older, more established method for sharing, known as Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory Terms (RAND). RAND allows vendors to be paid tiny fees by everyone who uses their intellectual property as long as those fees are reasonable and the tech is made available to everyone without bias. The company can't, for instance, jack up the price to its competitors.  The TIP board members are also encouraging participation by telling members that TIP will lead to plenty of other new commercial opportunities, too, even if TIP successfully turns the hardware into low-cost generic white boxes. Teleco providers can instead develop new software that can be bought via lucrative subscriptions, similar to the software startups that have sprouted up around OCP. In fact, Nokia is already experimenting with a high-performance software product able to run on low cost, ordinary computer network hardware. It's geared toward businesses, not service providers, but it's a start, Le Gourrierec tells us. TIP is also encouraging engineers and companies to join by creating a "culture" working group that helps teach telecom engineers how to "work fast and break things" as the internet world does.  "One of things we learned in the last 1.5 years in working on TIP is people saying, 'How do you help me transform my culture and my team so that we can move faster?'" Facebook's Parikh said.  Telecom is a world that traditionally frowned on that. Working fast and breaking things could take down the network and get you fired.  The culture group has become a popular entry point for engineers wanting to check out TIP. They then bring these ideas back to their jobs. It helps some engineers become more open minded about sharing. For others, like Le Gourrierec, it inspires "a new sense of urgency," in his work at Nokia, he describes. Afraid of Facebook  We only heard one major criticism regularly lobbed at TIP: that Facebook is becoming extremely powerful. Maybe too powerful. After Facebook launched Voyager, Facebook dominated the gossip at the last Mobile World Congress, sources told us. FacebookThere's good reason to worry. Facebook is making equipment with TIP and OCP, it's got state-of-the-art data centers, it has a roster of talented engineers and it's also laying its own telecom cable, including a new record-breaking fast subsea cable installed with Nokia between New York and Ireland. It could snap its fingers and become a powerful telecom and cloud operator tomorrow, some people fear (and others predict) like Amazon did with Amazon Web Services or Google did with Google Cloud and Google Fiber. But Parikh said that Facebook has zero interest in doing that. "We aren’t operating any networks ourselves. We are trying to help the telcos solve this," he said. The idea is to "share" lessons and technology to "always benefits" the whole community. SKT's Choi just shrugs off the idea that Facebook is a threat, saying telecom operators have more to gain than to lose. "I can understand the concern. It's very much natural, because operators are always being disrupted," he said, especially by large American internet companies "like Amazon, Google, and Facebook." Facebook TIP"But in the long run, I strongly believe in mutual benefits," he said. He notes that because Amazon helped create cloud computing, there are brand new billion-dollar markets and "everyone benefits. I think the same thing will happen in the teleco sectors." Not everyone is convinced that TIP will succeed. IDC's Mehra cautions that it's a huge undertaking and the two biggest telecom equipment vendors, Ericsson and Huawei, have remained cool toward the project, for obvious reasons, he says. "TIP may see progress over the years. But the challenges are higher. They are working on four to five different domains of telecom infrastructure, each with its own set of technologies and own set of tech providers," Mehra says. All the board members of TIP admit the project is in its early days and could fail. It could fail to attract a community. It could fail to produce products the world wants to use.  But they believe it will succeed. "Today most telecos remain as the status quo but all the telcos leadership, if you ask them, they want transformation. They want changes. They want innovation. They have to overcome it by collaborating with Facebook and others," he said. "Again, witness all the innovations that have already happened in the cloud industry. We want to apply all those innovations to the telco industry, which will make operators happier and customer happier and for everyone, a win/win."  Join the conversation about this story » NOW WATCH: Here's what popular dog breeds looked like before and after 100 years of breeding See Also: White House officials say Trump is 'undisciplined' and 'self-destructive' US Air Force fighter jets escorted an American Airlines plane into Hawaii after a passenger disturbance Google will let you search LinkedIn, Monster, Facebook, and more job sites all at once SEE ALSO: AT&T just completed a first-of-its-kind test — and Cisco should be terrified SEE ALSO: This guy took a Facebook project people hated, made them love it ... and catapulted into an incredible career Top Stories Mugshots: Guns, drugs seized in Port Neches Hearse stolen from McDonald's, body dumped in ditch Clock Boy's case implodes in court Ex-West Orange-Stark coach will now serve time Feds search Harbor Health, agents confiscate boxes Sour Lake driver indicted on intoxication manslaughter 14-year-old could face life as sex offender for sex with...

Add this to the simple and useful smart plugs from iHome, and you can control the lights, thermostat and more in your smart home using Amazon Alexa, Google Home and Apple Homekit. iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor: Design The iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor plugs into an AC outlet and monitors five different environmental categories including motion, temperature, light, sound and humidity. The device itself comes with built-in 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi. There’s a dimmable LCD readout that shows the temperature, humidity and status icons for Wi-Fi, sound and motion sensing. On the back, there’s a dimmer control, the power input and a reset button. It plugs into the USB cable that comes with the iSS50 and then into the USB to AC adapter that also comes with the package. The iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor takes up little space. You aim it wherever you want the motion sensor to pick up movement. iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor: Usability iHome iSP8 SmartPlug and Remote Control Setting up the iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor is easy thanks to the iHome Control apps for iPhone or Android. The app tells the user how to first connect the sensor to their phone and then it configures the sensor to connect to your Wi-Fi network. From then on the user will control the iSS50 with the iHome Control app over the Wi-Fi network in the home. iHome iSP6 SmartPlug The iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor works best with iHome’s SmartPlugs. These plugs connect any AC powered device and control them using the iHome Control app. The app can connect them to things like an Amazon Echo, Google Home, Android phone and Apple Homekit. I tested it using an Echo and my iPhone and Apple Watch and it worked very well. Although, sometimes the Apple Watch took a long time to load the Homekit controls to turn on and off lights. iHome Control Android App showing sensors in iSS50 SmartMonitor The five sensors built into the iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor are a mixed bag. Some work great and others are difficult to control. Motion Sensor – this is extremely sensitive and there’s no way to adjust the level of sensitivity. I set it up in a room to turn on the lights when I walked into the room. Just walking by the room’s open door turned on the lights. I even aimed it away from the door hoping that would lower monitor’s sensitivity in the region outside the room’s door and that didn’t work. It’s hard to complain about something working too well, but the sensor is so sensitive it makes it inconvenient for how I wanted to use it. It’s used best to monitor motion for when you first open your home’s door so it can turn on the lights or control other smart home features. Temperature Sensor – the device reads the room’s temperature accurately. I don’t own a smart thermostat like Nest, so this was less useful. However, I set it to tell me if the temperature raised above 85-degrees degrees, which would show a problem with my air conditioning in the spring or summer. I’ll set it to let me know if it drops below 55-degrees in fall and winter. This could also show that there’s possibly a fire if the temperature gets too hot quickly. Light Sensor – the sensor tells you what the light level in a room is. This can tell you if the lights got left on and you can turn them off at night without getting out of bed. Sound Sensor – I turned off the motion sensing and turned on the sound sensor. This way I can use the control like the old clapper. When it hears loud noise, like a clap or shout, it turns on lights in the room where I placed the sensor. Humidity Sensor – our basement used to have terrible problems with flooding. If we had the iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor then, we could have received a notice that the humidity in the basement was rising and spring into action before the flooding got out of hand. It’s convenient to turn on lights with a voice command using your phone or an Echo. That happens thanks to the iHome iSP6 that iHome also gave us to test along with the iSS50. I plugged my lights into the plug and then plugged that into the power outlet. The iHome Control app sets up rules and rooms. I can turn on all the lights in my basement that are plugged into two iHome Smartplugs. I can also just turn on the lights over my desk or in the den area of the basement. iHome iSP6 SmartPlug iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor: Value A lot of smart plugs and sensors exist, but the iHome iSS50 5-in-1 SmartMonitor and the SmartPlugs work together well. They will also integrate with Homekit to control other smart home devices like a Nest thermostat. The iSS50 costs $79.99 from iHome. iHome sells three SmartPlugs. The iSP8 costs $49.99 and comes with a wireless remote control so you can control lights or other devices plugged into the plugs from across the room or from another room. The iSP6 is just the SmartPlug and costs $39.99. The iSP5 is the previous generation SmartPlug and costs $39.99. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Sections Deseret NewsInDepth InDepth Here's how social media connects faith leaders with believers (and haters) around the world By Kelsey Dallas @kelsey_dallas Published: May 21, 2017 8:00 a.m. 3 Comments 1 of 1 View 1 Item Aaron Thorup, Illustration by Aaron Thorup Images of figures from Shutterstock Illustration by Aaron Thorup Images of figures from Shutterstock Related Links Trump's upcoming trip abroad will continue long, complicated relationship between the U.S. and Vatican Russia is 'much more religious' than it was 25 years ago. So why is religious freedom under attack? The Anti-Defamation League has been tracking online harassment since the founders of Facebook and Twitter were toddlers. Staff members scoured the early internet for Holocaust deniers and hate-filled messages. "Our first report on this goes back three decades to the days of bulletin boards and dial-up modems," said Steve Freeman, the organization's deputy director of policy and programs. The mission of ADL, a more than century-old Jewish civil rights group that works on behalf of all minority communities, hasn't changed since this work began in the 1980s. But the internet has evolved, becoming a complicated web of opportunity and risk for faith groups and religious leaders. "People who thought the internet would be free of all the nastiness we see in the streets were kidding themselves," Freeman said. "The internet was always going to be as hopeful and dark as the world writ-large is." Social media sites illustrate the internet's best and worst traits. A tweet from Pope Francis about Jesus's love simultaneously elicits gratitude and anger. May Jesus, who vanquished the darkness of sin and death, grant peace to our days.— Pope Francis (@Pontifex) May 8, 2017 Religious organizations deal with online abuse in a variety of ways, blocking personal attacks and reporting threats of violence to the people who run social media sites. ADL hopes to offer more tools, through an initiative that involves digital giants like Google and Facebook, to stop harassment before it spreads. In March, the ADL announced a new Silicon Valley center on cyberhate, technology and society, which will amplify efforts to end online abuse and produce policy recommendations for government leaders. Staff members, under the direction of a former government cyber security expert, will continue to analyze cyberhate trends, while also challenging technology industry leaders to create new ways to keep faith groups safe online. "We're going to build bridges and increase communication with the industry and shine a light on what's going on," Freeman said. Construction on the new center is expected to begin in the fall, according to ADL. Consequences of online abuse In spite of struggling with online harassment, few religious organizations or faith groups can afford to stay off social media, said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "You pretty well have to have an account," he said, noting that tweets and Facebook posts are the best way to connect with faraway supporters and spread information. #CAIR: Anti-Muslim hate crimes rose 57% in 2016, new report says https://t.co/XxOA2fZ5GX— CAIR National (@CAIRNational) May 9, 2017 Eight in 10 online adults in the U.S. used Facebook in 2016 and 1 in 4 used Twitter, according to Pew Research Center. Although social media accounts for famous churches and faith leaders may be plentiful, the potential for harassment limits how and when pastors and faith groups engage online. For example, Russell Moore, a prominent evangelical Christian leader as president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, has turned off Twitter notifications from people he doesn't follow. Sifting through responses was time-consuming and dispiriting, even if there were plenty of positive comments mixed in with the hate-filled ones. "I hated to (turn off those responses) because I enjoy interacting with people," he said. Simran Jeet Singh, a religion professor and regular commenter on issues affecting the Sikh community, said Twitter has forced him, again and again, to confront the worst parts of being a member of a minority religious group. "I've received everything from messages of hate to death threats. It's real ugliness that we only really see in our world when people can hide behind anonymity," he said. Sometimes, Singh will retweet troubling messages, encouraging his nearly 18,000 Twitter followers to recognize the limitations of discussing religion online. "I think it's important for people who don't experience this to know what some communities face," he said. Comments like this are why people of color have to be extra careful when talking about race and religion. https://t.co/lZ12QkgHEB— Simran Jeet Singh (@SikhProf) April 28, 2017 For the most part, faith-related social media accounts meet harassment with positivity, discussing the issues that concern them rather than being consumed by angry or false claims. "I don't recommend that our team engage with the real extreme haters," Hooper said. "It drains your energy and resources." Even the pope's social media team has to focus on embracing the good parts of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram without getting overwhelmed by the bad ones, said Bishop Paul Tighe, adjunct secretary of the Pontifical Council for Culture, to BBC News in March. "There's a lot of trolling, a lot of negativity. But if the people who want to use it for good withdraw from it, then the trolls have won," he said. "There is a potential here to build connections, to learn from people who might surprise us." ADL's new cyberhate center As part of its work to address cyberhate, ADL has advocated for the strategies Singh and others described. The organization offers a Cyber-Safety Action Guide, which instructs people on how to report angry or threatening posts on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, as well as on other popular websites, such as Pinterest and Amazon. By reporting threats or unacceptable comments, people of faith can help social media directors address the problem and improve their websites. "The volume of cyberhate is so enormous that these sites can't watch it in real time," he said. "They have to rely on people telling them." Catholic Mean Tweets Catholic Mean Tweets! How to handle mean tweets and hateful comments on Facebook. And what Jesus would, and did, say about it. Some pastoral advice for a social media problem. Thanks to Wyatt Massey and Nick Genovese for the idea and the video. (Thanks to Jimmy Kimmel, too.)Posted by Fr. James Martin, SJ on Wednesday, May 10, 2017 The drawback of this report-hate-when-it-happens approach is that it does little to actually end the abuse, Freeman noted. Angry social media users can create new accounts when one is shut down or encourage friends to replicate blocked posts. "The things that you can do in terms of blocking out the hate  doesn't eradicate this stuff from the web," he said. The goal of ADL's new cyberhate center will be to develop methods to stop online harassment, rather than simply reporting it when it happens. By working with Silicon Valley insiders, law enforcement officials and other industry experts, ADL hopes to harness technological advancements to solve some of the internet's most persistent problems. For example, the organization is already working with Jigsaw, a subsidiary of Google, to use artificial intelligence to combat hate. Jigsaw's program automatically searches for and flags bigoted messages or propaganda, and it can be used to delete problematic messages before they spread. ADL's new center will be headed up by Brittan Heller, who worked on internet safety issues at the U.S. Department of Justice before accepting a job with ADL. Her team and workspace in Silicon Valley were made possible by a six-figure donation from Omidyar Network, a charitable group established by the founder of eBay. "We think it's really important to act now to keep dangerous trends from becoming the norm," said Stephen King, leader of Omidyar Network's civic engagement initiative, to The Washington Post. In addition to addressing current online abuse, ADL's ongoing cyberhate work will look to the future and urge companies like Facebook and Google to design new products with the potential for harassment in mind, Freeman said. The organization will also continue championing programs that make young people better citizens of the internet, he added, noting that if social media users are taught about online abuse and cyberhate from a young age, they may become leaders in the efforts to end it. "We're looking for ways to educate people about how to engage with social media in a positive way," Freeman said. The promise of social media Moore is a fan of Twitter. It puts prayer requests on his radar and connects him with pastors who need spiritual support. Once, it even made him appear to have super powers. Moore had been meeting with Catholic and Orthodox Christian leaders when a new face appeared at the door. The visitor, who was also an evangelical, had seen Moore's tweets about the event and stopped by to chat. "He asked if I could pray for him and talk about some things going on in his family," Moore said. The other faith leaders were stunned. How had Moore and this man found one another? "They knew nothing about Twitter or social media," Moore noted. "They said, 'Wow. These evangelicals just seem to know when one of them is going to be somewhere.'" Freeman likes to hear light-hearted stories like Moore's. They emphasize the best parts of social media at a time when it's easy to get bogged down by the negative aspects. "Faith groups should keep putting positive things out there," he said. Although Singh is still baffled about how he became such a high-profile Sikh, he works hard to use his platform to increase awareness of his community. Singh tweets articles about Sikh musicians, campus life and his love of the NBA's San Antonio Spurs. He's trying to teach people about Sikhism and also show what it's like to be a follower.

"I try to use social media to humanize my community." 3 comments on this story In addition to raising awareness of little-known faith groups, social media has the potential to change the people who use it to spread hate, Hooper said. He shares informative articles and research in an effort to educate those who might otherwise harass anyone associated with the Muslim community. "After 9/11, I got an email from somebody criticizing Islam. Since then, I've interacted with him from time to time online to explain why he was wrong," Hooper said. "He recently emailed me to apologize after 16 years."

Xiaomi Mi Box Review: the best deal around for Android TV... for what it's worth Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2016/10/23 12:59pm PDTOct 23, 2016 49 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 82 Share on Twitter Total Shares197 Android TV Mi Box News Reviews Xiaomi / MIUI Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Hardware 4.1 Remote 5 Software 5.1 Apps 5.2 Games 6 Performance 7 Value 8 Conclusion There's a race to the bottom in the home entertainment world, created by the lower pricing for set-top boxes, the near ubiquity of built-in "smart" features for new televisions, and not least, Google's own low-priced efforts with the Chromecast. Compared to the rock-bottom pricing of gadgets like the Chromecast, the Amazon Fire TV Stick, and the market-dominating Roku boxes, Android TV is in a pickle. Stand-alone ATV units start at around $100, which is more expensive than the Roku you might buy (or the apps that come free with your TV), and less expensive than the home game console you might already have. Enter the Mi Box. This rookie Android TV entry from Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi is priced at just $70. It makes a compelling offer of just enough extra features on top of something like Chromecast or Roku to justify the extra cost, while still being the cheapest ATV device available at retail. With full access to Android TV apps plus the requisite Cast streaming capability, decent (if bland) specs, and a voice-control remote, the Mi Box hits a lot of positive notes. That's doubly true if you've been waiting over a year for a new stand-alone Android TV option, which has been limited to the so-so Nexus Player, the deservedly mocked Razer Forge TV, and NVIDIA's excellent but expensive SHIELD TV. How does this budget streaming gadget fare? Surprisingly well. The Mi Box can handle everything that other Android TV devices can with the exception of high-powered gaming, and the price tag is low enough to sneak into your entertainment budget. But once again the hardware is let down by Android TV; the immaturity of the platform - and its trailing position in app support - means that this victory rings hollow in the larger set-top box market. Specs SoC Amlogic Quad-core Cortex-A53 2.0GHz GPU Mali 450 750MHz; up to 4K 60fps resolution RAM 2GB Storage 8GB OS Android 6.0 Marshmallow Dimensions 101 x 101 x 19.5mm, 177g The Good Price At $70, the Mi Box is unbeatable for Android TV... though there are other streaming devices that are cheaper. 4K support There aren't many set-top boxes at this price point that support 4K resolution. Solid remote The small remote isn't anything fancy, but it's well-designed and easy to use in the dark. AAA batteries mean no recharging. Extras The Mi Box comes with "$76 of free offers," including VUDU, Pandora, CBS All Access, and Sling TV... though there are some caveats. The Not So Good Middling performance Even basic 3D games stutter and chop on the Mi Box. Poor specs One of Android TV's best extras over the competition is games and local media playback... so why does this thing have only 8GB of storage? A few kinks to work out Though Android TV 6.0 is fairly good overall, the Mi Box had some errors in startup and voice detection. Updates are uncertain. Hardware The Mi Box gets the job done and doesn't get in anyone's way. You can think of the Mi Box as a slightly newer version of the Nexus Player. Its tiny rounded body is less than four inches wide and deep and only about three quarters of an inch tall, making it an easy fit in just about any entertainment center. Thanks to the Bluetooth remote it doesn't even need line-of-sight - you can stick it behind your television and it'll work just fine. Inside is a "Quadcore Cortex-A53 2.0GHz" processor according to the spec sheet, and the vendor name is probably omitted because Amlogic isn't exactly a household name in the US. But that's more than enough to handle HD video when paired to a Mali 450 GPU, and might even be enough to handle 4K resolution. RAM is just 2GB, and storage is even more laughable at 8GB - what is it with making set-top boxes that are positively crippled for local file playback? Speaking of slots, there aren't many to be found. On the back of the plastic squircle is an HDMI port, a headphone jack, a power adapter port (not MicroUSB or USB-C, so no playing off of a battery pack or simple phone charger) and one lonely USB 2.0 port for input or data. It's pretty sparse, and perhaps an Ethernet port would be appreciated for those users who prefer a hardline, but for the price it's more than agreeable. The wall wart power adapter is skinny but long, so it'll work well with surge protectors but not so great for cramped wall outlets.    Other than that, the Mi Box is a nondescript lump of plastic. Not particularly attractive or offensive, it gets the job done and doesn't get in anyone's way. The only adornment on the top is a recessed black "Mi" logo, and on the front is a weak white LED to show that the device is on. A circular base keeps the light gadget from slipping around, with a barcode and regulatory labels inside. Remote The Mi Box's remote is exactly what a set-top box controller should be: easy, simple, small. My only previous experience with Android TV is on the NVIDIA SHIELD TV, and as excellent as that device is, the $50 add-on remote is pretty awful thanks to touchy volume controls and short battery life. The Mi Box uses conventional plastic buttons for everything, and not many of them: a directional pad with center select button, home and back buttons, a voice command button, volume up and down, and power. The remote uses Bluetooth, so it works without line of sight and even through walls. The standard AAA batteries mean it's a little chunkier than some similar designs, since it's only used for infrequent button presses and voice commands, but such is the price for avoiding d-pad keyboard input. The microphone is on the top, causing me to look like an impromptu karaoke singer every time I want to use it, but I had no problems with speed or clarity for voice commands. The mic wants your mouth to be very close to listen in, but that doesn't bother me: it means fewer false positives from other sources.    I wish it had is a headphone jack for easy Bluetooth listening with standard earbuds, but again, I think the budget pricing excuses this omission. A quick mute button would be nice, too. And since I'm allowed to nitpick in a review, designers, please don't make your remotes perfectly symmetrical: it makes it hard to tell if I'm holding the right end when I pick it up in my dark living room. Like other Android TV devices, there's no universal IR port on the Mi Box (though the SHIELD TV works with Logitech Harmony remotes). Software Google, having realized the error of its ways with allowing manufacturers the leeway of practically unlimited customization in standard Android, keeps a pretty tight leash on Android TV. And that's a definite plus for end users: it means that anyone who's used one Android TV device can quickly get a handle on another. Such is the case for the Mi Box - the grid-based homescreen is blessedly free of fluff, and all of the familiar apps from my SHIELD are present and accounted for. The Mi Box gave me a bit of a rough start when I initially set it up with my Google account: it offered an express installation, but balked on the login on both my phone and computer. But logging in manually was no trouble, and every other login and search was covered by an easy web connection or voice search, respectively. The homescreen is Google's Leanback Launcher, with about a dozen apps suggested but not pre-loaded, so they install from the Play Store upon first selection. Aside from quite a few CBS apps, these are all pretty standard - I already use Netflix, HBO GO, WatchESPN, et cetera. Furthermore, diving into the somewhat haphazard Settings menu allows you to hide any of the suggested apps you wish to. Games get their own dedicated section, and the familiar suggested content ribbon sits on top of it all, pulling mostly from Google services. All of the expected bells and whistles are present. While the Mi Box doesn't come pre-rooted (not that you'd expect it from a retail device), non-Play Store apps can be installed with a security setting. Screenshots can be taken with a quick tap of power+volume down (dear Google: thank you, sincerely every Android gadget reviewer), and Bluetooth accessories like mice, keyboards, and controllers can be added easily.    By the way, in addition to supporting Netflix out of the box, the Mi Box can also handle A2DP Bluetooth audio - I used a Bluetooth speaker while the device was plugged into a speakerless desktop monitor for most of this review. Both of these features are still missing from the Razer Forge TV more than a year after release, and Razer's box is $30 more expensive. Maybe bringing up the Forge TV's shortcomings in a competing product review is petty, but it's frankly insane how poorly Razer has supported its device and customers. I'll stop saying it when it stops being true: don't buy the Forge TV for any reason. Xiaomi loads up the Mi Box with the Android 6.0 version of Android TV, with the security patch only caught up to June. Perhaps it would be too optimistic to expect Android 7.0 on a device launching in October... but it would be just as optimistic to expect any major software updates for the Mi Box. We'll see - this is the first Xiaomi Android device offered directly to retailers in the United States. Apps If the Mi Box has one weakness, it's the same one that depressingly clings to Android TV at large: the apps. The selection of streaming applications and games for ATV is better than it was a year ago thanks to a concerted effort by Google and its partners. But there's no denying that app selection is sometimes lacking... and sometimes the apps that are on the platform are lacking, too.    The obvious major exclusion for Android TV is Amazon Prime Video. That isn't the fault of Xiaomi - or Google, for that matter - but it's something that's available on Roku and Android phones and tablets that simply can't be done on Android TV. More esoteric exclusions are getting rarer. For example, the CWTV app that I rely on for my shamefully bad superhero TV shows doesn't come in an Android TV flavor (despite the fact that it does come on Amazon's Fire TV platform, Apple TV, and the Xbox). But like other sources that aren't explicitly available for ATV, I can stream it via the Cast function on my phone. There is at least one thing the Mi Box can do that a cheaper, better-supported Roku can't: stream live TV from an HDHomeRun. I use the roll-your-own-cable box for college and NFL football games with a basic Comcast package, and the Mi Box can handle streaming fine via either HDHomeRun's own VIEW app or Android TV's built-in Live Channels app (though it needs the VIEW app to work, so why bother?). Roku doesn't have the broader codec support necessary for HDHomeRun, nor can it play local directly off of local storage, or host a Kodi system, or a few other more advanced goodies.   But these activities are for more advanced, dare I say geeky users, the kind who would prefer Android TV to Roku simply because it is Android. For the average user who just wants the fewest steps to the most content possible, Roku still has the Mi Box - and Android TV - beaten. Games Look, if you want to play Android games on your TV, get a SHIELD. The various attempts at making an Android "mini-console" have utterly failed, and the way that Android games have to be set as explicitly ATV-compatible by developers limits even standard Android TV devices like the Mi Box in appeal. NVIDIA's dogged dedication to secure exclusive games, plus desktop PC game streaming and GeForce subscription options, make it the only really viable option in this category - everything else just gets a few casual games sprinkled on top of the standard Android TV experience. That being said, those who want a few extra games on the Mi Box won't be overly disappointed. The included remote is fine for casual fare like Crossy Road, and more recent games like Riptide GP Renegade are at least playable. I wouldn't want to see them rendered at the 4K resolution the Mi Box touts in its packaging, but for a little light fare or four-player party games, it'll do. Performance The Mi Box handles the basic Android TV interface and any streaming video apps with ease. I regret that I don't have a 4K display to test it out on, but given the immense work that's gone into preparing modern streaming for the luxury, I'm fairly sure it would handle such applications well. But there's no denying that the Mi Box is operating at a performance level well below some of its competitors. The ZenPad S 8.0 scored nearly double what Mi Box did despite being a budget tablet. So, yeah, not great. While games are fresh on our minds, let's address them. As I said above, the Mi Box is fine for less complicated titles, and handles 2D textures and light 3D well enough. But the moment you switch to something more intense, you'll notice choppy framerates and intermittent slowdown. Renegade GP, Asphalt 8, Goat Simulator, and even lighter fare like Hungry Shark Evolution all displayed this middling performance. Even my go-to fighting game, Soul Calibur, experienced some slowdown problems - and that's a game for a nearly twenty-year-old system. Benchmarks aren't especially useful in the case of the Mi Box... because recent devices "max out" on 3DMark for the Ice Storm Extreme, the only test that runs on the Mi Box without crashing. Just for the sake of comparison, the Mi Box scores 3902 on Ice Storm Extreme. The recent Asus Zenpad S 8.0 is the only device we've seen as of late that doesn't max out the test, and it scored nearly double what the Mi Box did despite being a budget tablet. So, yeah, not great.     The performance issues aren't limited to games. When streaming more complex Cast tasks like a video tab from Chrome, the Mi Box will often choke and let the audio drag behind the video. Using the Bluetooth remote for voice searches sometimes simply crashes Google Play Services. These are definitely some kinks that need to be worked out, but not dealbreakers in and of themselves. Again, a SHIELD would be better for just about everything described in this section... but not necessarily $130 better. Value I've already made my opinion on the Mi Box vs a comparable Roku pretty clear: get the former if you want a cheap way to tinker with Android TV that will serve almost all your streaming needs, the latter if you want something that just works with every streaming video service you throw at it. But since we're talking about Google-rific streaming gadgets at the sub-$100 price tag, there's another one we need to address. Chromecast Ultra, the 4K-enabled, HDR-compatible, beefed-up Chromecast model, is coming to the market next month. It will also cost $69. In a head-to-head competition, the Mi Box has the Chromecast Ultra beat dead to rights. Aside from the obvious advantage of local apps in addition to Cast functionality, the Ultra lacks its own remote - Android TV gives you the choice of phone control or more conventional remote buttons. Add in games, middling performance issues notwithstanding, and Xiaomi's offering is clearly the better deal. It's worth noting here that Google has discontinued the Nexus Player and made no mention of Android TV at the recent hardware refresh, so the platform's health isn't looking great for the long term. Even with poor performance, the Mi Box is demonstrably the best deal for an Android TV set-top box. But next to the $35 standard Chromecast suddenly those apps and games seem less appealing, especially if you don't have a 4K TV. Odds are pretty good that the phone in your pocket can handle games better than the Mi Box, and it has a bigger selection on the non-segmented Play Store too. Get the Mi Box if you want a cheap way to tinker with Android TV. For those who are fine with 1080p, the Roku Streaming Stick offers all the same features as the Mi Box for $20 less, and the Amazon Fire Stick is $30 less. The Roku Premiere can handle 4K video for just $10 more... and if I was in the market (and my job didn't depend on knowledge of Android), that's probably the set-top box I'd get. Much like Google's various Chromecast offers, Xiaomi is sweetening the pot for the Mi Box with a ton of intangible extras. Buyers get free access to three months of Pandora premium music, a $5 VUDU movies credit, one month free of CBS All Access, and most impressively, $50 of credit for Sling TV. Unfortunately you'll need to prepay for three months of Sling - a $60 minimum - to get that last bit, which makes the "$76 of free offers" badge on the retail box ring a little hollow. Conclusion As a relatively cheap way to check out Android TV the Mi Box is an easy recommendation, much more so than the discontinued Nexus Player or the expensive SHIELD TV. "You get what you pay for" is a cliché, but it applies in this case: don't expect anything much past solid video app performance and a good user interface. 4K compatibility is impressive, and might be the one thing that puts the Mi Box ahead of similarly-priced offerings from competitors. If you need a simple streaming gadget with as many apps as possible, and you're fine with 1080p for the time being, there are better choices. Ditto for gamers: assuming that you don't have a recent console already, the SHIELD is the clearly superior choice. But if you have seventy greenbacks burning a hole in your pocket and you're dying to give Google's TV experience a try, go for it.

They all get entangled by some mystery process, they always do Aaron Honeycutt I'd like to know where that SD Slot is. ;) Michael Crider I must be going crazy. I could have sworn I'd seen a slot on there when I was first trying it out. (In my defense, it's pretty crazy to leave it off of an 8GB device.) Aaron Honeycutt It does have a full size USB port for a Flash drive and Android 6.0 to add more space. dukaki The light from the headphone jack may be an optical audio output. I looked it up when my macbook's headphone jack lit up while installing windows because the audio drivers were missing. harryposter Ah okay, how do you do carry an optical sound output through a jack exactly, Einstein? dukaki Are you serious? Did you even bother to read the other comments? harryposter As you are serious as I am, please explain how do you get a light signal (photonic) through a copper cable... dukaki You must be a troll but anyway here you go (quoting from wikipedia because apparently you can't even use Google): Mini-TOSLINK is a standardized optical fiber connector smaller than the standard square TOSLINK connector commonly used in larger consumer audio equipment. The plug is almost the same size and shape as the ubiquitous 3.5 mm stereo minijack. Adapters are available to connect a full-size TOSLINK plug to a mini-TOSLINK socket. Combined 3.5 mm jack and mini-TOSLINK sockets exist which can accept a 3.5 mm jack or a mini-TOSLINK plug; mini-TOSLINK plugs are made 0.5 mm longer than electrical jack plugs so that the latter are too short to touch and damage the LED of combined connectors. Many laptop computer and portable digital audio equipment models, such as the Google Chromecast Audio device[6][7] and Apple AirPort Express and iPod Hi-Fi, use these connectors that allow for the insertion of 3.5 mm electrical headphone output or microphone input or mini-TOSLINK digital output. harryposter I was talking to you dukaki, I did bother to read the other comments... Not yours, because you didn't bother to write any harryposter The brown light coming from your arse may just be shit... buggleston Interestingly, there's another red LED hidden deep inside the headphone jack, apparently to help you find it in the dark. Optical audio output. Michael Crider Huh. I've used optical for my TV before, but it had a proprietary square jack - I didn't know it came in 1/8th inch format. buggleston Yeah, it's the same optical digital signal, just a different physical connector that allows a dual-purpose headphone/optical jack. You can get adapters or cables with the different connectors on each end. Plexabit My Lenovo Y50 has one (separate from the headphone jack). Weird considering I would think someone who'd use S/PDIF would also have a dock or something so an optical cable isn't draped across their desktop. harryposter So that's another thing again designed to make you buy more adapters and so on, as long as the billions of plebs need it, it makes the 0.001% oligarchs richer... forresthopkinsa Or maybe they just didn't want to add another bulky port to their device... Vince78 The adapter comes with it, so you don't have to spend extra money. (it is very small, so it wont take much space). buggleston What are you even talking about? There's an actual reason for the different form factor, with the clear benefit of enabling a headphone jack to output optical digital audio and eliminating the need for a separate jack/port. Computator That's the same optical connector that the Chromecast audio uses YaKillaCJ It uses the same TosLink cable but U attach the mini adapter (that looks more like a holder lol) that comes with them. harryposter I like your look CJ, and I like your thinking too... Richard Branches One thing that was keeping me from buying an android TV device was the lack of an optical audio out (except TVs with android TV), I was waiting for a device with it and it finally arrived, I'm not planning to replace my old home theater which serves very well for this purpose, I'm satisfied now. harryposter Any M8 has an optical out or an Hdmi out or whatever and these boxes are as good as the expensive nvidia shiet Mick O’leary By "these boxes" do you mean M8's or Mi? Виктор Ковыршин I wonder can I use it as a bluetooth receiver streaming music from phone to stereo system? I know it supports chromecase, but sometimes you need that. Richard Branches You'll have to try and see, it should work but I can't tell you right now because I haven't purchased the box yet... moehre Well, the reviewer does not seem to be that qualified to make a rather objective statement. wade_county FYI: You can order any streaming device (including Mi Box) on walmart.com pick it up at the store and get 2 free months of Sling plus 3 "selected" Vudu movies. (Create a new account if you want to use the Sling offer that comes inside of the Mi Box) https://www.walmart.com/cp/sling-vudu-free-offer/4038581 Cesar But that would mean I'd have to go to Walmart... wade_county You could get it shipped to your house too. Cesar Still means handing my money over to Walmart, which I refuse to do. Duder12 Amazon is an even worse company harryposter So, what are we going to do? harryposter They're all the same! Hand your money to your local farmer! harryposter Anyone can have a fucking box shipped from China... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That's "Tar-zhay" propaganda. Walmarts are friendly, helpful and low-priced. harryposter Yeah, they have friendly low-priced salaries also... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What's your point? Target is 10/hr/ also. harryposter And that makes a life? Your (pi)xellency? NO harryposter $10 per hour is fucking stealing Everybody should be at $15 MINIMUM But this idiot Obama made it something like 7.50... Eh? harryposter What's your target? Jobs and crap made in China? harryposter What about the DMCA shit? GingerNinja It only lacks HDR compatibility, and that's enabled in so few current televisions (and streaming video apps) that it's fairly easy to dismiss. According to the landing page, Mi Box does support HDR. http://www.mi.com/en/mibox/ Jason comes with the promised android N update Carter McBride There is an option to enable HDR in the settings in the 6.0 already. rquinn19 Option is there, but it does nothing. Source, I bought two Mi Boxes for my two 4k HDR capable TVs. Didn't work. So yeah even though it says it does it not working yet. harryposter It means it's "future proof" just like the old "HD ready" tv sets... Just in case they will trigger the bloody thing harryposter Great, my idiot smart TV says HDR is on and off when on netflix... Mobile_Dom can the shield remote be paired to the Mi Box or does it not have bluetooth fallback? harryposter Why would you want to use a Shield remote that costs an arm instead of the Mi remote which comes free with the box? Mobile_Dom becasue the shield remote is boss, it has a headphone jack and a volume slider as well as looking nicer than the xiaomi one Lateef Alabi-Oki No disrespect to Xiaomi. I'm sure their Android TV offering is decent. However, I implore you, if you want an Android TV box, just get the Nvidia Sheild TV. It is the best set top box on the market. Period. Nothing compares. Not Apple TV. Not Roku. Not Amazon TV. Yes, it's more expensive, but you get what you pay for. I'm upset it's not recommended enough for such a nearly flawless product. posito75 I agree. The Shield has Plex server, Kodi, 4K Vudu, 4K Netflix and Sling TV. Th is a cord cutter's wet dream. Nothing out there can compete with this. Jason umm you do realise that this mi box can do ALL of those as well for a fraction of the price posito75 Nope. Not the Plex server or 4K Vudu. On top of the other things i didn't mention like high end gaming. The Shield is a well rounded streaming machine. The mi box is a striped down version of the Shield. The mi box is cheaper but you don't get most the functionality. Jason Im not sure about 4k vudu as i havn't got the box yet as shipping to Australia is taking forever. However support will more than likely come in an update as its capable of 4k netflix and 4k youtube. Plex server? would be nice but the majority of people won't ever use that, plex client though, sure. Comparing a $70 device with one that is nearly 3x more expensive is interesting. Im sure for 90% of the population the Mi ticks all the boxes, yes if you game on it then you should be looking at the shield but you would be better putting that money towards a ps4 if gaming is your thing. Olav Plex and similar services are becoming more popular by the day, especially now with the beta program for the PVR function(which the shield sadly isn't included in yet). The Shield is by far the easiest option besides using a laptop(god forbid) and desktop for a Plex server, just plug in a HDD/NAS/some form of storage for your media and follow the instructions in the app and you're good to go with a rather powerful and not so power hungry server. Gonza How do you access a NAS from the Shield or other ATV box? SAMBA (Cifs) ? can u pls elaborate? YaKillaCJ Basically you enable/install a media server that uses the UPnP protocol. Depends on your NAS. Most comes with and allows the option. In many cases, U can install a better software than what it came with. Also most NAS have options like Samba, NFS, FTP, SSH. Which can be opened easily on Kodi/SPMC or BSPlayer. Thereby making having the Shield as a Plex server redundant if you do have a NAS. Or in my case, a weaker setup because I have a custom built computer as a NAS. Gonza Got it! Thanks so much! YaKillaCJ Honestly I had been using the DLink-DNS320 installed with ffp (custom linux os). Now I use a full desktop custom computer with Open Media Vault installed. It consumes a little more power but thats to be expected. If ya have a old pc sitting around, that's the route. daweeze02 I have 2 Shield TV's and honestly if the Xiaomi box was out when I got the shields I would have gotten them instead. Don't get me wrong, it's a great box but with my Xbox and over 50 games shared with my brother I literally only use the Shield for Kodi with Pulse CCM and a paid IPTV sports package. I live abroad so I have to have my American sports in HD and no buffering lol harryposter Why not a bloody M8 with Kodi with 8gb? More than enough, even for 4K UberCrew 8GB of storage is a joke. Some people want to install things other than Kodi on their boxes. Some people want to stream Netflix, Amazon, Vudu & other things in true 4K which the M8 box can not do. harryposter Stop saying I have no clue what I'm talking about... I have several android boxes and all support 4k, Netflix etc. for a fraction of the Shield's price... As for network media streamer, even if it's 5 years old (but with firmware upgrade last year) it works perfectly without a glitch! You're just another fanboy owning an iPhone I'm sure... UberCrew You are not streaming anything in 4k from Netflix on a streaming box unless it is one of the following. Air 7410X (Waoo! in Denmark) AirTV Player Amazon Fire TV (2nd generation) BANDOTT BA101 (FLnet in Taiwan) British Telecom - BT DTRT-4000 Broadcom VIP5662 (Bell Canada) Chromecast Ultra Dish Hopper 3 Fetch Mighty Nvidia Shield Orange Livebox Play 4 PCCW nowOne PlayStation 4 Pro Roku 4 Sagem 4K (Totalplay in Mexico) TiVo Bolt UHD Swisscom TV-Box Virgin Media - V6 powered by TiVo Vodafone TV (Italy) Xbox One S Those are the Netflix UHD supported streaming boxes. So unless you have one of those boxes you are full of shit. UberCrew The WDTV is an outdated piece of hardware that places like Amazon are still trying to sell for $350. Any idiot who pays $350 for a WDTV is not a fanboy but a complete moron. harryposter You don't even know what you are talking about. I can stream anything I want in 4k with my crappy android box which cost a tenth of your nvidia shiny thingy harryposter exactly UberCrew Why would I pay $70 for a Mi Box and/or $300 for a PS4 Pro/ Xbox One S? The Shield does everything the Mibox can do but does it better plus it can do much more. If I buy a Shield then I don't need to buy a USB to ethernet hub and a USB flash drive since the Mi box does not have an Ethernet port and only has about 5GB of it's meager 8GB storage remaining. Sorry but 5GB of storage just isn't enough. Also I am of the belief that for high bandwidth streaming a wired connection is a must. I just want a reliable media streamer that does everything well. The Shield beats the Mi Box hands down in that category. I also want to sometimes play PC games on my big screen TV without having to run another long cable to my TV. The Shield does this while a PS4 & Xbox One do not. I am not going to get into the reasons why but I strongly prefer PC Gaming to the locked down console gaming. So the Shield does everything that I want it to do, and IMO at a reasonable price. Jason Cool story. Guess what? Your not everyone. The Mi box does exactly what I and thousands of others need. In the last 3 months that it has been released there have been 3 firmware updates that have rectified 90% of the issues it had on launch. I have AC WiFi and stream 4k fine. Yes it may not be for everyone but for most it's fine. You can't compare a $60 device with one that's 4x the price, there's a reason why it's cheaper, sacrifices were made but for many we don't need what was stripped. I have a 4k screen on my pc so I'm happy to sit there for gaming lol UberCrew For most people the MI Box costs $69 while the Shield Android TV is $199. So for most people the Shield is less than 3 x the cost. Also for me I value my time. Which I factor into any purchase how much time am I gowing to spend getting the product to work correctly. For me I factor in the cost of a USB hub and flash drive as I stated in my previous post. That adds at least another $40 cost to the MI Box bringing the price to over $100. Making it only 1/2 the price of the Shield When reading all the stories of the MI Box struggling to work with USB hubs and USB to ethernet. I factor in all the time I would have to spend troubleshouting to get it to work properly. After factoring all the time I would have to spend to get the MI Box to work the way I would want it to. That extra $100 I would be spendingredients on the Shield is well worth freeing up some of my tI me and avoiding all that frustration. I understand that many peoplease would rather save the extra cash and won't care as much spending their t8me troubleshooting. Or many don't care about using WiFi only for their steaming. Others may be happy with only 5GB of intrenal storage. I know for those people the MI Box may be good enough. Just was giving another point of view. Also pointing out that just looking at the upfront cost isn't everything. harryposter You can plug a USB storage drive on the Mi for less than the Shield and more storage... You remind me of these Apple fanboys UberCrew Tell that to all those Mi Box users who are getting errors every time they try to adopt a USB drive as internal storage. You remind me of one of those loud mouthed drunken idiots who stumbles around town screaming nonsense. UberCrew Tell that to all those Mi Box users who get errors whenever they try to adopt a USB drive as internal storage. I'll pay a little extra for something that actually works. harryposter Those users are the problem, not the box... You know it UberCrew I don't know it seems to be a known bug with the Mi Box. Since I don't own one and don't plan on buying one I have know way of knowing whether it is a user error or a software bug. harryposter Even my PS3, not even 4, does play games wireless to my TV, what on earth are you talking about idiot? UberCrew I am talking about streaming real PC games from a Gaming PC to your TV, doofus. I don't play any locked down garbage console games. harryposter I have a FTTH 1Gbps fibre connection, not BT crap and any android box including the Mi can handle it... You are just an expensive gear fanboy, by the way the Nvidia Shield was discontinued and we are waiting for new cheaper models and certainly even less reliable... But still expensive crap UberCrew Your connection is only as strong as it's weakest link. Your 1Gbps broadband connection won't help you much if you have a under-powered box running on a crowded WiFi network in your home. The 2017 version of the Nvidia Shield has already been released using the same specs as the previous version. The base model did lose the microSD card slot and the micro USB port but still has the gigabit Ethernet port and the two USB 3.0 ports. So it is still using 2015 technology unlike many of the other boxes out there still using hardware from 2010 or earlier. Can't believe some of these devices don't even run anything other than USB 2.0 which has been around for over 16 years. USB 3.0 has been available since '08. harryposter I still don't understand why do you need more than 8Gb (or any Gb) to store streaming things? You don't need to store anything while streaming live feeds, games or even your own media network! Ryan plex stores a ton of metadata; the running a plex server on the 16GB model out of the box is not terribly useful.. I have a 146GB of Plex Metadata on my 16TB NAS.. and you cant move plex data off to external storage. for such a killer feature; anyone with any serious media concerns isint using it.. and I dont need a ShieldTV for every room in the house, just a plex/netflix/pandora client. Michael Habel It's also an older (Year old Tech), when you actually pear it down the S902 SoC it comes with is certainly better then the S802 SoC that the MXIII came with Two Years ago. But this MiBox still has the crappy Mali450 GPU in it that was also in the same MXIII. It would have been better had they gone with a Mali T820 GPU. But Xiaomi are basically selling to noobs here. YaKillaCJ It's not about the power. We get that the Shield is better. But the cost is a huge factor. Besides, the Chromecast is weak and yet it functions great. They aren't selling to noobs, they selling functionality that's budget friendly. I'm far from a noob and knew what I was getting into. I wanted a user friendly device to run media off of. If I wanted power or a gaming machine, I would just attach 1 of my custom built PCs in the hdmi port instead. harryposter One year old tech... Well, guess what happened with the transition of the PS3 to PS4... LESS TECH harryposter While Nvidia is not selling to noobs... Gimme a break! Richard Markert You don't need a plex server on an STB. I have an actual server that runs plex and feeds a shield, a mi box and an Xbox one. harryposter Why would you need a nvidia shield or a damn Mi for gaming??? These blocks are for streaming! I can watch 4k streaming on a bloddy $20 android box and it's gorgeous... UberCrew I want to stream games from my PC to my TV without having to run another cable. That's why I would want to use the Shield to stream games. If you don't understand the reasoning then maybe you should do a little more research before making pointless comments. harryposter I can stream games from my PC to the TV in another room wirelessly through my WDTV with 1ms pings Yes it's 5 years old but it works! UberCrew I paid less for my Shield and it does more than that and does it better. Shield TV $199 for the ultimate media center box using 2015 hardware, or WDTV $350 for 5+ year old hardware. Which one am I going to pick. harryposter Oh dear oh dear... I paid $80 for my WDTV box 5 years ago... I bought it only to run Slingplayer to watch FiOS from a slingbox based in NYC but it perfectly plays Netflix in 1080p UberCrew Now they are selling for at least $350 on Amazon which I would never pay. harryposter Seriously, I'd rather buy a cheap Mi than a $300 Nvidia Shield considering it will become obsolete next year... UberCrew I didn't pay $300 for the my Shield. You can get one for $150 or less if you wait for a sale on Amazon. The Shield will be going strong for a few more years while the Mi Box users are having issues with basic apps like Netflix right now. YaKillaCJ The MiBox does all this. Plex server omitted because it's exclusive. I get it but factor in cost to benefit. I don't game on this box, I have an Xbox. Nor do I use it as a media server because I have a OMV machine. I'm not saying the Shield isn't great, I'm just saying I can convince an average person to easily buy a $70 MiBox but not a $200 ShieldTV. When the $70 box does everything they want. Thade780 The Shield is the only one capable of running the Plex Media Server because it transcodes from its (quite powerful) GPU. No other Android TV set top boxes have the power to run it. YaKillaCJ I personally don't use Plex because lack of control, universal compatibility, optization and privacy. It's basically the "non-technical guys" media server. Not that it doesn't work. It does the setup process easy for the everyday person. I use a powerful pc as a full NAS/media server however. I get that the Nvidia should is nice to have but it ain't worth the asking price for my home network setup. Nor is it worth the price of the average consumer when a $70 box does the same. Same as in you can use Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Pandora, Google Cast, Kodi/SPMC, etc. Thade780 While I agree that it may be overpriced (it depends on how much you regard something expensive, no doubt about it), I am not really seeing your point on Plex being non tech savvy. I got a full blown server at home (part of my homelab) dedicated to my media. Other than Plex, I also run the usual Couch/Sonarr/Sab/Headphones services on it. Between dockers and VMs, plus the fiber passthrough to my SAN, everything is running the way I want it. I used to use a centralized headless Kodi with SQL server, where multiple other clients connected to it. To me it was a mess. May I ask you what you use as a server for your media? Michael Habel A separate noname cheep assed NAS Box, set up with either CIFS, SAMBA, NFS as possibilities, and then using Kodi (MXIII - Another Amlogic Box, AFTV2, PC etc...), to connect to the NAS Box, over the Local Intranet. BAlGaInTl And then you have to fight with Kodi which I don't find the best experience on Android TV boxes. You loose the remote access and transcoding of Plex. I use Kodi, but only for live TV because I have older HDHomerun units that don't support streaming directly. All of my OTA recording goes straight to a Plex folder and is cataloged. harryposter BS! Why do you need Kodi to share your local files? Get a WDTV box instead, Kodi is for what you know... BAlGaInTl I don't think you read it right. Did you not see that I said I only use Kodi for live TV with older HDHomerun units? I use Plex for the files on my local network. harryposter You setup seems complicated, why don't you just run IPTV or Perfect player for your TV, and Kodi for all the rest? Is that complicated? BAlGaInTl My setup is complicated. Cutting the cord, and doing it all legally is complicated. Not everyone wants to bend/break their local laws. I could just buy a OTA Tvio with lifetime service, but where is the challenge in that? UberCrew The WDTV is overpriced for outdated technology. The hardware in the WDTV is over 5 years old and you are talking about the Shield being overpriced.. harryposter And? Do what? BAlGaInTl I also run a OMV backend server (OMV, Plex, Tvheadend), but disagree on the evaluation of Plex. I haven't found anything that can do all that it does while providing a good 10ft experience that is wife approved. I'm also curious what is being used as a media server instead of Plex. Thade780 Same. I tried basically every one that I could find. The only one that comes close to Plex in terms of features that I need is Emby. harryposter Emby? Rubbish Thade780 Coming from the guy that uses WDTV I'd say you have to shut up. harryposter I am sure you do all this shit to catch legally free to air UK channels through the freeview inside your system... Oh shit they're all free! That makes you USELESS YaKillaCJ The application I use is Twonky. It's just as organized as Plex but way less resource heavy. Uses UPnP making it a bit more universal without the complications of logging in, even though you can have logins based on what you decide others should be able to access. It makes things simple enough that if anyone/any device/client connects to my network, it can pull up the media using whichever network player they are familiar with, not just Plex. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Plex is bad. It can likely be setup in a similar fashion but in its attempt to be so "easy", it complicated other aspects. But to really take advantage of it, U need a Plex client and Player. I have Terabytes of media and only uses a memory cache of 7147KB. Another aspect is that Twonky is 1 time flat fee of $20. Plex best aspect is its on the fly transcoding which I personally don't need. Plus it's not that simple to take full control over what/how things are transcoded. For remote access, I use BubbleUpnp which is feature rich. Cuvis I'm not sure you understand Plex to be honest. You only need a login if you've explicitly enabled it or if you're accessing through MyPlex (i.e. outside of your home network, without having opened up ports on your firewall). And Plex also supports UPnP and DLNA, so you don't really need a Plex client to use it (though obviously, you'll get a better experience if you do use one). YaKillaCJ Yea I kno, I even said it can be setup in such a way. But Twonky in my use case is much less resource heavy and runs the same, with easier setup and control. Plex redeeming quality is its on the fly Transcoder. harryposter You don't even need a login with Kodi harryposter Why would I use this Twonky shit? Are you an affiliate? YaKillaCJ Nope not at all just my user experience. It's lightweight and gives full control over all media including things like accounts and device tree setup. Not to mention it works on nearly every OS and hardware configuration. harryposter How much do we regard a bunch of crappy plastic? This box is as good as $15 Chinese android boxes... Without the loaded stuff though, thank you As for the Tx1 thingy whatever, it's just an ARM harryposter And why would you want to run a Plex Media Server? WDTV Live does it better than any nvidia crap Thade780 That just shows that you are an ignorant fanboy. Sod off. harryposter A fanboy of what exactly? I am no effing Apple sheeple, please explain what a fanboy I am... UberCrew Some people don't want to buy a WDTV and prefer using Plex with their Shield. harryposter Who gives a shit about Plex??? Андрей Софинский Xiaomi miBOx has only 20% of Shield TV specs and capabilities. Thats why 70$ is normal for that. Michael Habel Sometimes 20% is cool enough harryposter 20% out of an overinflated value seems like a £100 save... But the thing is: this crap is no worther than £20... YaKillaCJ More like 85+% of the capabilities. All its lacking Gaming. Everything else works harryposter Of course... You don't buy an IPTV box for playing games! harryposter It's not a fucking gaming console, it's a streamer! An ultimate streame, but too expensive to be even a razor YaKillaCJ Funny enough it's I'm half way through Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. Works just fine. harryposter Who needs a fucking $300 IPTV box to stream anything? Only Nvidia and their sheeple... BAlGaInTl You seem angry... harryposter Angry about what? I just wonder, should I buy it or should I not? That's all... I have two other m8s boxes working great in the living room and the bedroom... BAlGaInTl I guess it all depends. I got a Shield (deeply discounted) because it was the best upgrade at the time to Nexus Player. If the MI existed at that time, I most likely would have gotten it. UberCrew It is more than an IPTV box. It is a great streaming box for media, games, will soon operate as a smart things hub with google assistant. If all you want is a cheap IPTV box and don't care about quality then look elsewhere. Just don't whine like a little bitch if that cheap box doesn't do all you want near perfectly. harryposter Great, it will talk to your Google assistant about what's missing in your fridge... Can't you just open the door and see what's missing, or rather what you would need for your next dinner? You need AI for that? UberCrew Again another ignorant comment. Do some research on Google Assistant, Google home and SmartThings, I don't have time to explain everything to you. It's not for everyone but some people make use of it. harryposter Yeah, your fridge scans its contents and orders eggs and milk because your own brain is so busy about everything else... Fuck the Uber society! UberCrew I am going to scan your computer right now and access your bank info so I can order you a real media streaming device. harryposter Yeah... Good luck with that... UberCrew I think you should go to Tesco and demand that they sell you a Mi Box so you can at least say that you own a true Android TV box. If they claim that they do now have any tell them that you are the great grandson of the late Sam Walton and they are to contact Walmart in Bentonville, AR and have one shipped to your flat asap. harryposter My computer doesn't exist my friend, only vulnerable unprotected computers exist on the web, which mine isn't a part of it... I don't exist my friend! harryposter So, how is the scan going on? harryposter So, how is it going? Any luck? Found my porn? harryposter Did you find my bank info or only the porn videos? LOL You are a fucking idiot... UberCrew I found the sheep porn, so I am going to ship you a few sheep from Ravello so you can experience the real thing. harryposter Sheep porn? With the wool or only the scisors? harryposter I don't need to google, I have all these boxes and I know what they do, unfortunately the only thing they don't do is filtering trolls like you but I'll be fine... UberCrew The only troll here is you. Go back and hide under your bridge. harryposter At least I have a 1Gbps connection under my bridge... UberCrew A 1Gbps is good to have hopefully you not bottle-necking it by using a crappy WiFi connection to stream everything. harryposter I have all my important streaming wired and all the stupid devices wireless on about 80 Mbps, still enough to watch netflix in the bedroom UberCrew Well at least you are smart enough to have all your important streaming devices wired. harryposter I am considering buying an Amplifi system to stream the fucking 1Gbps all across the flat... It says we can get at least 480Mbps wireless with this system, bring on 12K tv! UberCrew 12K TVs are a few years away. We haven't even seen 8K tvs yet. Hopefully by then most people will have access to at least 10Gbps FTTH. harryposter LOL, you really are funny Uber! Now my 1Gbps fibre to the premises is as crap as my gear... LOL LOL LOL harryposter Yeah I know, the internet of things etc. I know I know I know fucking millenial idiot! I have been in the IT business for the last 30 years, what do you want to teach me? harryposter I don't want Google to check on my fridge, what was in my fridge doesn't mean I want to have the same the day after... And fuck Google by the way harryposter My cheap box does everything I want in glorious 4K with its cheap 8gb storage... Why do you need storage for streaming, be it local or otherwise? UberCrew For people who make use of more than a handful of apps, 8GB of storage is not a lot, You do understand that apps take up storage space? harryposter Yes I do, but I have a load full of apps installed on my box and still have 5GB available... Properly designed apps are taking no more than a few Kbps or Mbps maybe Not really an issue, is it? UberCrew I don't need to worry about that either way,I always prepare for the extreme. Which means I have extra storage available if need be. Storage is cheap so there is no reason for these companies to only include 8GB. harryposter So what's the problem? You can plug a 1TB storage usb thingy to the box but I still don't understand why you would need to do this? UberCrew I don't need to do that since my Shield already has enough internal storage for apps. You are just looking at it differently because you use few apps, while there are hundreds of streaming apps out there. For local media I just use a NAS. harryposter Why do you need extra storage on a streaming box, that's the thing I do not understand especially when the box acts as a media server using external storage on the network... Please explain harryposter An android box is not a smartphone my friend, you can get rid of all the Google crap, fakebook etc. And you will still have at least 5Gb available to stream whatever you fancy in glorious 4K UberCrew 5GB isn't enough space for people who want to install more than a few of apps. It's great that your are happy with your dinky little box but I expect more from a media center device. harryposter There is something you don't understand: a media center/hub doesn't need any storage, the storage is on your other devices: PC, server, cloud, whatever... I don't understand why you would need more than 8Gb or even less to store nothing... It's a media streaming device streaming from various sources, the storage is in those various sources, no need to store anything in those 8Gb other than some cache... Cappici? UberCrew Not if you have a bunch of different apps installed. I am talking about app storage and Android apps can get large even some streaming apps. I install a lot of apps because I like to try things out and have as many streaming sources as possible. Even some of the custom Kodi builds can get rather large. That 5GB of storage gets filled up pretty quickly. I am not talking about local media that can be stored of a NAS or Media server. I am talking about Android apps. Some apps can be as large as 100MB. I probably have apps installed that you have never even heard of. harryposter Well if you want to run Adobe Creative Suite on an android box that's your decision, I only use it to stream streaming things you know? I have my desktop beast for all the photoshop thingies back there in the study... My Android apps are Kodi, IPTV, ProgTV, PerfectPlayer and that's about it. I use it to cut the cord... Not to design things An android box is not a computer, it's a box UberCrew Yeah it is a computer actually. I don't use it for design or work, I use it for streaming media and games. You have very few streaming apps on your box while I have close to 100 on the Shield plus I have SPMC & Kodi builds installed. I may get rid of Kodi since SPMC is better designed for Android TV. harryposter I always clear the cache at each session, any Kodi sesion is just about 70Mb and that's it/ And I kill all apps that don't need to run... That way I always keep a clean and smooth running system, I watch full HD TV streams without any glitch... It';s even better than satellite tv harryposter What are these apps I never heard of? Aptoid? Modbro? Showbox? Slynet? harryposter Oh shit, you are a copyright cop... UberCrew I am sure you aren't streaming anything from the official Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, or Vudu apps in 4k. There are very few devices that support 4K streaming from those services. I bet you are watching 480p video and can't tell the difference. I know you cheap Android box is not streaming in 4K at least not from those official channels. harryposter Uber you are an idiot! I stream Netflix with my legit account on my 55 Ultra HD LG tv in 4K I can still stream it in glorious 1080p from my WDTV box I doubt I wouldn't notice it would be in 480p... Oh my god, what a jealous moron you are! My Android box streams in 4k, sorry to disappoint you but you can stick to your expensive nvidia shield... UberCrew You said you were streaming Netflix in 4k using one of those cheap android boxes. So you are just a liar and a moron. harryposter I said I was streaming 4k content from those cheap boxes, I never said it was from Netflix because I already have 4k netflix on my TV But yes, I can stream 4k youtube or whatever from that cheap box and it's great. Mind you, I have a 1Gbps connection via fibre to the premises, not to the cabinet... harryposter I never watch anything in 480p, not even fake 576 HD or so called 720p I bet you do... UberCrew I bet you are and you don't even know it. You claim you are watching Netflix in 4k on a cheap android box which most likely isn't running Android Tv. Which either means you are watching something other than 4k resolution and can't tell the difference or you are lying. None of those cheap android boxes can even stream Netflix in 1080p. harryposter I didn't say I watch Netflix from my android box, I am watching Netflix in 4K from my LG TV app (and Samsung app in the bedroom) in all glorious Ultra HD. But I still can watch 4k stuff from YouTube or other sources on my android box. Or in 1080p from my WDTV which is good enough to be honest. Do you really think my eyes wouldn't notice the difference between 480 and 2160p on a 55 inches screen??? I don't understand what your point is! Do you watch 4k on your laptop or on your smartphone? harryposter You are an ignorant, the nvidia shield hardware is the same as those "cheap" android boxes but with an expensive branding... Just like Apple... UberCrew So you think the Nvidia Shield is running the same hardware as a M8, a ProBox2, Minix boxes etc? You really believe they are running the same hardware? harryposter Yes I do my friend... Mine is a T8 by the way, not a M8 4K and all the tutti quanti harryposter Nvidia shield is using the same hardware as the cheapest boxes but it sells for more because of the branding, just like Apple. Just like my cow's poo would be sold as gravy under the Apple brand... UberCrew I think you should stick to working on the farm with your sheep and cows. You don't have any clue about technology if you really believe that the Shield has the same internals as any of those other android boxes. harryposter Yes I do But some workers in China may have better bonuses depending on what brand they are working for, doing the same thing... harryposter Why would it need to run Android TV? You just need IPTV apps, Kodi et voila! harryposter Amazon is crap, I don't need Hulu or Vudu, I've got FiOS, Netflix and Kodi. Enough said... Now Uber, put on your tie and go drive your Uber taxi... harryposter And that's why rare is expensive... 399 last time I checked. Because the shield has a design looking like the new French Mod infest with Win10... I think I will not buy it harryposter You can install all these things on a bare $30 android box, nothing excuses the extortionate price of $300 for an android box that has all these FREE things pre-installed and probably out of date anyway... UberCrew You don't understand the difference between an Android box and an Android TV box. harryposter There is no difference UberIdiot, an Android TV box is just an Android box with IPTV apps installed on it... UberCrew Nope try again Android TV is a fork of Android that is designed for TV apps (the 10' user interface) yes that is correct. Android TV devices use the Leanback launcher. There are very few true Android TV devices. Shield Android TV, Mi Box , Air TV, Nexus Player (now discontinued) Razor Forge TV & the ADT-1 (developer kit first device running Android TV released by Google) are the main ones. There are many TVs also running running Android TV, Sony, Sharp, Philips, & LeEco are the main manufacturers. Android TV devices are the only boxes running android that are officially supported to play HD and 4k content from Netflix. So yes there is a difference between boxes running the mobile centric version of Android designed for touch screen navigation and Android TV boxes which use the Leanback launcher for use with a remote and viewing on a big screen. harryposter Ah ok, so I have an Android TV box after all because when I click OK on my my LG Ultra HD remote, it shows PCM 2160p etc So I am lucky, my Android TV box is a real tv box, is that what you are saying? Because everything I am watching through my T8 android box if full HD or 4K when available... Whatch Marseille on Netflix and you can see the people fucking if you zoom... UberCrew If you are watching Netflix 4k through the app installed on your TV then it is most likely true 4k. If you are watching Netflix 4k through the app on your T8 then your TV could be upscaling the picture to 4k. Read this for more info https://help.netflix.com/en/node/13444 Renaud Lepage Hear hear, I honestly want nVidia to nail the market. harryposter That's not going to happen... Renaud Lepage It could, if they actually wanted to dominate it. harryposter If they want to dominate it, they would have to sell cheaper hardware which means, oh wait... things like the Mi box without the shining green veins running all over it UberCrew The green lights can easily turned off. harryposter What green lights? Ah I see, the shield green thingies harryposter And can the remote control price be turned off? 3 buttons, £119? UberCrew Yeah the remote control is overpriced. If you buy the new version of the shield it comes with the remote and the game controller. You can however use any bluetooth remote you want to navigate. harryposter Can the shield be operated without a shield remote control that is optional? UberCrew Yes you can operate the shield with an airmouse/wireless mouse and keyboard if you really wanted to. You can use pretty much any Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, controller, or remote. harryposter You can't dominate a market when the remote is optional for a £100 with just 3 buttons on it... The Nvidia is designed for Emirati noobs Wilson does it support 4K HDR? Lateef Alabi-Oki Yes rquinn19 Ummm, no it can't lusky3 Yes. It has 4K HDR support. Not sure why you think it can't. rquinn19 I know it can't because I owned two. Supposedly it's coming with an update. There's an HDR option, but it does nothing. lusky3 You should have said that instead of just saying it doesn't. It will support HDR with the Android 7.0 update. Edit:Typo. rquinn19 It's on MM already, it's N update will supposedly enable it. But until it's enabled it can't do it. We don't know if it ever will until it can. harryposter Well I don't know either whether I go to the local Kurdish I will find Volvic water at last and some Bulgarian Lukanka Fuck Tesco! Even the local shop beats Tesco! harryposter Tesco: they used to sell Volvic water, but they don't do it anymore Tesco: they used to sell Ayran, but they don't do it anymore Tesco, they used to sell FOOD but they don't do it anymore Tesco; you only sell CRAP harryposter My fucking BT box and effing smart TV handle HDR, and believe me, there is not much difference you idiots lusky3 Not sure why name calling is necessary on a 2 month old post. But being able to handle HDR is much different than getting the benefit of HDR. If you aren't noticing much difference, it's either because you content you've been watching isn't filmed in a way that would take advantage of HDR, or your TV has a very basic implantation. Watching content on something like a LG Oled TV vs an edge lit Sony are 2 massively different experiences. harryposter I watch 4k HDR content on my LG Ultra HD tv but I suspect the reason why I don't notice any difference is because the source is not broadcast in 4K HDR, or even if it is, it wasn't shot like this in the first place... Most 4k shows on Netflix are not even shot in 1080p... Marseille is a real 4k show, truly shot in 4k Travelers is not, it's shitty 720p even if it says 4k in the info... harryposter It's because you have a fucking "HD ready" TV you noob, not a 4K... harryposter It's because you have no broadband you idiot harryposter He was talking about the Nvidia, not the Mi Lateef Alabi-Oki https://shield.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-hdr harryposter Just like £30 android boxes... Michael Habel IIRC it's an Android Marshmallow thing, so yes probably. Michael Habel This thing is what? 80$, even the cheapest Shield will set you back over TWICE that! And if you wanted the 500GB version. The only version worth having. Well it's not much of a contest, if what your looking for is a simple Device that can stream Netflix, and YouTube in 4k. While it's unfair to class a Ferrari with a VW Golf, they are at the end of the Day both Cars, and they accomplish more or less the same things. And for the same reasons. The Shield should be the defacto "standard" and competition should cause the price to drop some. As it is for the Shield Pro, it's either that or a PS4 Pro. And that kinda makes it a hard choice. harryposter A Golf or a Ferrari or a 2CV, all have to drive at a maximum speed of 30mph in my London street... All these morons roaring their machines downstairs at 2am... Matt I have kind of been fighting with them recently. I bought one when they released the Plex Server update; however, currently there is an issue using network storage like they claim that you can. It might not be affecting everyone, but it's a known issue, they stated that it's a known issue and that they have a fix for it, but it has been months now and they're not even saying when the fix will be released. I realize that updates take time, but when you release something that flat out doesn't work, you should probably get a fix out a little quicker. harryposter Yeah of course, Nvidia Shield is the best of the best, but $300 for a f****g android box, seriously? Nah... harryposter Yeah right; Xiaomi Mi Box: $60 Nvidai Shield box: $300 with same specs Bigger and ugglier with a green glowing shit... Go figure... Lateef Alabi-Oki The Shield TV is the most powerful set-top box on the market. It doesn't have the same specs as the Mi Box. It has better specs. UberCrew The guy is clueless so no point correcting him. He aimlessly posts baseless ignorant comments and makes himself look like a fool. UberCrew You just proved that you have no idea what you are talking about. The Mi Box and the Shield Android TV do not have the same specs. Not even close. The base shield model is not $300. Also you still have no clue of the difference between a box running Android TV and a box running Android that connects to a TV. Do some more research before making any more ignorant comments. harryposter You are playing words Uber... A Uber is not a real taxi my friend... It's a car with the same engine but with a small bottle of Evian in the back seat... Nvidia is the same UberCrew Nope not playing words at all. if you actually did a little research you would know the difference between a box running mobile android and a box running Android TV. harryposter My box is running Android and that's it It's not a phone, it's not a TV box unless I tell it to be, it's just an android box harryposter Well my box is running Android TV with the leanback launcher UHD 4K etc. You know, with the green droid saying hello on the right and coloured tiles on the main screen... Yes my friend 4K and all, flawless And you keep saying I don't know what I'm talking about blah blah blah... Oh no I don't know what gear I have and I don't care, it just came out of the blue and I don't understand what all these boxes are... Hell, there is even some kind of flat stone like a monolith in 2001 but horixontal... And me the noob I didn't realise it was a TV until you told me! What a noob I am! harryposter I don't need to do a little research, I did a big research before deciding what gear to buy and I bought that gear based on the results of my BIG research... Thank you mister knowitall but I will pass your advice for the time being... harryposter When did I say I have an Android TV box? I have an Android box, end of story. It's plugged to my TV with IPTV apps and Kodi, so that may make it a TV box maybe... but a free one UberCrew Kodi works great on my Shield. Difference is my Shield is running Android TV so it can play HD & 4k content using the Netflix app as well which a box running vanilla mobile android can not do. If you are happy with a box running vanilla mobile android then that is fine but you should know the difference. harryposter My T8 can play 1080p and 2160p (4K) Yes, I am happy with its limitations... Dick Dastardly✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Now that's one dirty looking penny..did you get it back as change when you bought the Mi Box or is this a review unit? TechGuy22 two words: Shield motherfucking TV Paul Rainwater thats 4 words harryposter No, that's three Lazy Tango I thought they were making an updated (Not sure what they would add) Nvidia Shield TV. Whatever happened with that? harryposter It's nvidia shield 2017: cheaper but crappier, just like PS4 compared to PS3... Linh I feel like I'm the only one that ever asks... why isn't there Play Movies/TV offline playback? Google's help docs used to exclude Android TV, but now it says Android/iOS *devices* and Chromebooks. And yes, you can rip your own dvds/blah blah blah.. but have you (or anyone else) heard any movement on this? Also, after a year or so of using the Chromecast... it's great for single viewing or quick showing of a youtube video, but I still prefer to have a physical separate remote. A normal one I can hand to family and not get any questions, heh. harryposter WTF would you want a download and play crap rather than streaming? Linh umm, have kids? They like to watch the same thing over and over. Bandwidth caps anyone? This isn't me, but it's a bullet point. Personally, I tire or random blips of connectivity. I want to be able to cache a movie/show/whatever and not worry about connectivity issues (be it the ISP, Google, Amazon, Roku, etc). Or I know multiple people in the house will want to stream.. having it done ahead of time eases up the connection. I literally want to see the caching ability already built into Play Movies be usable on Android TV. Or now, Netflix. Amazon would be nice, too. harryposter Netflix £8.99 per month with 4K content Why would you need to download when everything is available? UberCrew Some ISPs in the US have a monthly Data cap. if they go over that data cap then you get charged more (usually a certain amount such as $30 per ever GB you go over the monthly data cap) or with some of the extreme ISPs they will just cut your service off. Yes many of the ISPs in the US are still doing business like they did in the '90s. Of course most ISPs also offer TV service here so with so many people cutting the TV portion of their service these ISPs want to gouge money from their customers in other ways. harryposter Just stream it again and over and over... You seem to live in the year 2000 mate Linh Well, mate, I'm in the US. There are plenty of caps still in play here. And it's still no where as reliable as something cached locally. I'm not fond of the random hiccups that occur. The technology is there, it works, it seems arbitrary not to have it enabled. Alex S anyway to test if this works with captive portals, like in hotels? the fire tv AND the roku do, but chromecast does not. Midnitte Hm, you could sideload chrome and try to get it to work that way? Zsolt V Just curious what makes the Nexus Player so-so in your mind? I have one, use it every day, I feel it's literally the best device I own. It's always on by the time my TV shows a picture, auto-updates and reliable. No, I don't use it for gaming, only watching shows or YouTube. YaKillaCJ Exactly. People teach the NP but it works for what it was meant to, Media Consumption knightracer I like my Roku over the Nexus Player. Most streaming apps seem to work better. catalysto I had one and have the same opinion. For me, it was often slow and buggy. Apps crashed. The system crashed. It lagged out. It wasn't, like, THE WORST, but for something I would be using nearly every day, I knew I'd get tired of it real fast. This was a good while ago though, so maybe a lot of it has been fixed with software updates. Still, after trying the speedy, super stable SHIELD, I could never go back. M J The software has come a long way and that was the biggest issue in the beginning. The worst of which was the HDMI audio passthrough didn't work with a large number of TVs. Once they had that fixed, it's been working mostly flawlessly. After getting a Shield I moved it to a secondary TV where it's been working for the last year and a half or so. My only issue is that the wifi on it is utter CRAP. it will hold up to normal 1080p streaming but when I try to use it with my HDHomerun it's absolutely aweful. It can't handle the higher bandwidth. Midnitte Got one for the family and its pretty awesome for what you pay for. Now if they would just release a Mi Box+ with slightly better performance and additional USB ports (or higher capacity) and I would pay that $10/20/30 premium. The lack of app support and confirmed update support are really the only thing holding this thing back. But I guess as long as you have an ISP that supports it (comcast sigh...), and with Netflix/YouTube/Cast support you really don't need much for it to be a pretty good deal. smikwily Get a USB hub and plug it in. May want to do a little shopping to verify it is compatible, but it should work. mpj the mibox actually has IR so harmony remotes work. also it's very easy to install any unsupported android tv app from Google play to mibox (use pc) and use sideload launcher... best value on market imo Michael Habel The only App you'd want to sideload is ALREADY in the PlayStore... It's Kodi. Yes you'll need to hit up Google to find things like TVAddons, and SuperRepo. But it's 2016, and we all know how to finally use Google or? mpj spmc is a much better build than just kodi since its geared towards android tv and has voice support but ya obviously kodi has its own add ons too... YaKillaCJ SPMC is a significantly better fork of Kodi. Surround sound & hardware acceleration control alone makes it better. Angelo Blerpa Allegra I dunno in US but, at least in Italy, rechargeable AAA batteries are everywhere. Gonza Thanks. Something I've been trying to understand about ATV apps. The review mentions that you can sideload apps. But my question is...will any android app work (like the box was generic tablet) , or only apps made specifically for ATV will run?? SirWoggles about any Android app will work. How well it works (specifically navigating around) depends. Gonza Thanks YaKillaCJ It has a Optical Audio Output/3.5 mm jack just like found on Audio Chromecast. Right in the Settings under Sound, it has the choice for Digital sounds via PCM, HDMI or SPDIF. Another misprint I notice is that it does indeed have a IR Receiver. That little white light. I only found out because I have a Redmi Note 3 Pro and tested the Remote app which doesn't connect via Bluetooth/Wifi and the signal was spotty. I noticed I had to point at it. Thus I hooked up it up to my IR Booster and tested it. ZaZaRemote for example also uses the IR Blaster to send the signal. Btw it also has a much better handle on CEC controls than the Nexus Player. Their is some bad tho. It lacks drivers for connecting a regular usb ethernet adapter. The build in codecs are weaker than the power of the hardware. BSPlayer will allow it to play much higher quality files/formats over Kodi/SPMC, MxPlayer or VLC. oroboros74 Can you tell us more about why/how BSPlayer plays better than the others? YaKillaCJ Well BSPlayer handles much higher quality and/or files than the rest. It's Hardware Decoding beats the rest by a bit. I have some files in really high quality/compression (h265). I mean they look and sound astonishing. Only problem is that they take more powerful and/or optimized hardware. Which many Apps like VLC, Kodi will play every format that's thrown at it but they aren't built towards using our mobile processors/gpus. yoloswagzoor shield > mibox > all others boxes. Author may live in the past as he want storage for movies on the box lol, wake up it's 2016 you are not using a nas ? or a external hdd ? or even cloud storage ? Duder12 I agree with this 100%. Fire TV is just an Android TV wanna be by slowly inching their regular Android ROM to be an Android TV copy. Roku is power user limited and has a bad UI. Apple TVs remote is TERRIBLE and initial cost is $$$. Android TV just needs a few more apps and it will be far beyond the others. YaKillaCJ Seriously. Buy a NAS. Better yet, build your own and install Open Media Vault or Nas4Free and never look back. I don't even download things to my own computer anymore, just use the NAS to do it. Plus it transcode on the rare occasion I actually need it. jodieisme So I've looked up what NAS is, and it seems too much to hassle, it's awesome though if you had technical capabilities to set it up yourself.. But for the time being, that mi box and raspberry pi (osmc or openelec) are sufficient enough for a casual user like me and my wife.. I like that NAS idea though, would definitely give it a try after learning more about it.. =) YaKillaCJ It's actually a lot easier than U think. If you can use a Raspberry Pi, then you can clearly deal with a NAS. Essentially it sounds like it already use it like a NAS. Only difference is the 2 operating system I named are feature rich and may even be able to run on a Pi. PC_Tool Heck, I have a 4TB drive plugged into the USB-3 port on my router. Problem solved. All of my media gets stored there and it is accessible to anything on my network. Mi Box had no problem finding it. Vince78 Exactly, so all other decives can also use it all the time. And not only when your media box is powered on. You don't need local media storage. JustSumGuy no but you need enough space to have more than a few apps loaded. I had a memory crash at only 6 apps when my Kodi data was around 2.5 gigs it crashed and flushing Kodi was the only answer. Sucky box needs more ram. Hoang Hi m8! i wonder how do you do that? i am trying to find a way to get my MI box to locate and play up movies from my PC but i really dont know so please help. MadMartigan Kodi. Install it on your Mi Box from the play store. Make sure your content folders are shared on your network (make sure the network is secure first!) and then browse to them from within Kodi. You can do much more with Kodi (setting up a dedicated library, adding apps to the home screen via custom skins, etc...), but just getting it to play network media is pretty straight-forward. Do a search "android tv kodi NAS" and you should find all kinds of instructions. NK Have two Mi Boxes and they're working great as set top boxes for secondary TVs to stream to via HDHomeRun. Love the HDHomeRun... no more Verizon FIOS equipment and getting whole house DVR for a fraction of the cost I was paying for Verizon FIOS quantum. J_Pod My MiBox works great. I was going to buy the 4k Chromecast anyway, so when I saw that this was getting sold at Walmart I just jumped on it. More features for the same price, and couldn't pony up the month for the SheildTV, this was it. Jason Pagliaro From my understanding, it's missing the one main feature of the the Chromecast Ultra: 4K casting. Captain_Invisible But why would you really need that? The main reason you buy an Android TV device over a Chromecast is to not having to Cast stuff. Jason Pagliaro I cast quite often, even with a shield tv. J_Pod Do you know how could I go about checking to see if that is the case? Open a 4k video on YouTube on my phone and cast it? I'd love to find out if it really does or not. H3ff Yeah. If it can cast 1080p videos and can output in 4K, there is absolutely no reason you wouldn't be able to cast 4K videos. Abhishek Saral So this or Chromecast Ultra for the same price. I might get the Shield if it gets cheaper. Rupa Schomaker Love my Nexus player.... Except no volume control, not even over HDMI cec. So, thinking of using this instead.... duke69111 Does the MiBox work with a USB to ethernet adapter. YaKillaCJ Sadly No... yoloswagzoor it's said to be compatible on this webpage http://item.mi.com/1142400020.html?cfrom=list ? duke69111 Thanks. It looks like there are a few that might work. https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/56jcgg/ethernet_on_mi_box/#bottom-comments JD It does but you need to the Mi one which isn't sold officially in North America youareme7 There are lots of people on reddit saying it works with other adapters, but the performance hasn't been very good at least with the adapters that are also a usb hub. I just bought a Cable Matters 202023 USB 2.0 to 10/100 Fast Ethernet Network Adapter that's coming tomorrow hopefully will work without issue. I use HDHomerun for TV so I need stability more than speed. Right now the Mi will regularly develop and audio stutter in the tv stream that only rectifies when I close the app duke69111 Thanks. I have the Nexus Player for that exact purpose and was considering the MiBox to get rid of my main cable box from Cox. youareme7 Just an FYI followup, those ethernet adapters don't work with the mi box (so stupid) but this one does work, I plugged it in last night and it popped right into ethernet mode: Plugable USB 2.0 to 10/100 Fast Ethernet LAN Wired Network Adapter https://amzn.com/B00484IEJS duke69111 Thanks. duke69111 Thanks. idigdoug I have a Mi Box i bought from Wal-Mart connected to the internet with a USB to ethernet adapter....works fine. bpcooper14 I had been looking at picking up one of these but will hold out for now. Trying to wait and see more reviews. Christian Wagner Jr I have this in my bedroom, and I HAD a Shield Pro. I went to Best Buy to pick up the shield (16gb) which was $199.99. When I went to check out, one of the sales associates pointed me to the clearance section, which had a 500gb model, for 1/2 off (150.00). There was also a shield controller (the game pad came included with the Pro model), which was also 1/2 off. Total, including a 15.00 discount was 160 something or other. So check your local Best Buys for the 500gb model in the clearance section. I returned mine because while yeah it was neat, and handled games pretty well, I didnt really need another gaming machine, so Geforce now was useless to me. Check your local WalMarts for this Mi Box. I just got home from mine in Germantown, WI and they had 1 left. They seem to sell out fast! Carl Hill Just reading your cons negates everything positive you have said about this box....also, 4k playback is choppy as all h....the Shield is a beast... Jerry LI The pricing is around $35 (250CNY) in China. Much cheaper than you would expect. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c731425d6641c009670c972afbb9031d5db3da891ece3e09d12d33a389f41bb5.jpg yoloswagzoor it's not the same model... Grant Laird I have mi box and its not too bad. How about probox device? I understand its using older android OS but its little better than mi box. You can find it at amazon or direct website. Also I don't see this device review on androidpolice.com? http://probox2.com/ PROBOX2 EX+ Smart TV Box; Android 5.1 Lollipop, 4K2K Ultra HD Video, Quad Core Cortex A9 Processor S812, 2GB/16GB, Dual Band Wifi, Kodi, H.265 /w Remote+ Air Controller They now have newer version as well. yoloswagzoor no android tv, no google cast, no tv apps support, android 5.1, i'll pass ! Peter Wighton Shield does do Netflix with 5.1 surround, Captain_Invisible A very US-centric review of a (nearly) US-exclusive. BAlGaInTl If it's a (nearly) US-exclusive, then why wouldn't it be a US-centric review? ddevito "When streaming more complex Cast tasks like a video tab from Chrome, the Mi Box will often choke and let the audio drag behind the video" Thank you, FINALLY a reviewer mentions this. I went through 3 Mi Boxes since their support is useless only to realize it's just not a Google Cast solution. Андрей Софинский The Best on the market is Shield TV even with its price. If you have SHIELD - you will not want any other laggy bullshit. The owners of Shield know that. harryposter As an IT boss posting this sort of comment, I am sure you would recommend BT business or AOL for a reliable service... LOL harryposter The owners of Shield have no clue about how they are shafted big time... PC_Tool I don't have the gamepad for it so heavy 3D gaming isn't really a thing for me, but I do have issues with the device. The VLC app installed accesses network storage easily enough but has a very hard timing syncing audio - even delaying or running it ahead often doesn't work as it seems to randomly change it's position relative to the video. The really odd bit is that Kodi works just fine (once installed) for playing video off SMB (I have a media-drive attached to the router's USB-3 port). (Even after the immediate software update that was available after getting it set up) Google's apps play video just fine (YouTube, Google Play Movies), and casting seems to work well enough, though I haven't used it much (anything I'd "cast" is available on the "box"... I like it a lot more than the ChromeCast, especially once I got Kodi installed, removing the audio-syncing frustration. Deeco Shame it's not available in the UK, and if it does come here it will be rediculously priced #fcukbrexit MW Aliexpress now have the international version for £60... harryposter Fuck Alibaba JD Is there any kind of digital audio out on this box? jerry "Middling performance Even basic 3D games stutter and chop on the Mi Box." Probably because they are using a Mali 450 as a GPU, instead of a Mali 830, or Mali 820, or Mali 760, or Mali 720, or even a Mali 620. harryposter Or even a Mali Bamako... Michael Habel Local File playback?! REALY?! Talk about missing the point much! Games might have won you the argument, but are they even selling that Box with that function? (e.g. with a Bluetooth/WiFi Gamepad). I must have missed that bit. This Box, and most like it are there to stream content (Netflix), or in the case of a (A)FTV2 both Netflix, and Prime. So there isn't much call for Local Media. But, since you called it lets roll... This thing, like so many other Boxes out there have Casting (e.g. Screen Mirroring), capabilities to broadcast your "Media" off another Mobil Device (i.e. Phablets) to your TV... Assuming your TV is so old as to NOT support that function by itself. For those with a NAS Box full of Content (e.g. The broader target of Local Media Files), there is Kodi which shouldn't even need to be mentioned here. But, if you are genuinely not in the Group that has ever heard of Allwinner, Amlogic, MediaTek, or Rockchip. Or the slew of Devices that have been doing the same thing for yonks now then you might be forgiven. Otherwise you just need to install that, and setup your Network Shares though that, and Bobs your Uncle. The only upside over this to the AFTV2 is the largely stock Marshmallow (Android v6.0.1) UI, and the fact that you can install Kodi though the PlayStore. I suppose the downside though would be that lack of Prime though. But, I for one could live without it. JD You understand my sentiment that most Americans won't. But most Americans are old fogeys that are slave to their cable companies while the rest of the world is moving towards cable cutting. Michael Habel That could be the point. I'ma Ex-pat, living in Germany now for the last 20+ years. So IPTV, (Kodi), has been a bit of a dream come true for me. But the larger difference between here, and back there is, competition. We have it you guys, (Or so it seems to me...) don't. Where you have to pay your Cable Co. a Mint, I pay about ~40€ for a 50MBps - 10MBps VDSL service with no caps. From the feel of it from where I'm sitting you cats could only wish to have it that good. JD Why is this review so bad? Michael couldn't you give it the same level of enthusiasm as the shield or any phone you guys review. Seriously now cmon this thing runs android it should get the best androidpolice can dish. The short blurb anandtech had on this thing was more of a review. I want to know about connectivity, AV hookups, more on ease of use, Video performance of media play back. How plex and kodi work on it. Sound video codec support does the cast option work well and does it support music only? Not you yammer on about what we already know which is that this is the best value for an android box or hell the only option besides the shield for an android box. Its not a gaming box like the shield its not marketed that way so give up on it. Its a playback box Howard Loo I bought the Mi Box from Walmart (online) and have been using it for about a week now. Apparently my unit does not appear to have a MicroSD slot although I have seen some Reviews that show it having such slot. I am confused. UberCrew The Mi Box does not have a microSD card slot. Anyone who says that it does has either been misinformed or they're just lying. It does have a USB 2.0 port which can be used for additional storage. C64 I'll keep my Nvidia Shield TV that i bought for 100 euro's 😎 gthrift There is an IR port on the front of the device, next to the power led. My harmony hub is controlling it via IR. youareme7 Came here to say the same thing, I'm using my harmony touch controller to operate it. The only thing that doesn't seem to work (for me) is powering it on via activity. harryposter Holy shit! You mean it can be powered through a remote control? WOW Chris Shim It's worth noting here that, outside of the rather expensive nvidia shield, this is the only box on the market that can do both Kodi (far better than Plex) and Vudu. The only thing holding me back from getting one is that I already have a Nexus Player with the Vudu app sideloaded from a Mi Box, but each update requires me to seek out the apk all over again and that will get old fast. Every other box on the market can do everything else that everyone else can do, it's these 2 apps that make or break it for me. This is the reason I went with a Nexus Player and until now the only option I had for my Ultraviolet collection was CinemaNow which has some truly terrible video processing that they do which makes watching movies through it a horrible experience. harryposter Wrong! You can load Kodi and Plex and whatever on any cheap android box! refthemc I just picked this up last night at Walmart. It's actually pretty cool. Simple to use and easy to navigate. Wish it had multiple accounts support and some sort of pins feature like my Xbox does for my favorite apps and games. Also a Nougat update would be great as well lol. Only thing I'm wondering now is if I can install MX Player and play some .mkv and .mp4 files I have on a usb Michael Lynch I got my mi box from Walmart... ordered it online for in-store pickup. The code I received for Sling TV did not require any payment upfront at all, let alone 3 months in advance. Also, the CBS All Access code that was inside the packaging of the mi box has actually turned out to be for one year. In my case the freebies have just about paid for the mi box itself. I am sure others have already pointed out that the mi box does have an IR receptor on the front and optical digital audio. The biggest drawbacks to me are the 8GB of included storage and the single USB port. I have solved the latter issue with a cheap USB hub. Vidyanand Sharma Can you confirm the CBS code is actually one year? Mine shows one year but hope they do not charge at the end of the month automatically. Michael Lynch No charge here and it's been over a month. razorsbk You can get it for 50$ on aliexpress. Cuvis That's the Chinese market version, that doesn't come with Android TV. razorsbk Thank i didnt know that and i was wondering why is so cheap. harryposter Who needs Android TV??? Nee Austin I'm enjoying my Mi. It works. In my world, I bought it as a $70 Chromecast Deluxe (since it's replacing a V2 chromecast). I think it suits that purpose very well. The comparison to a Shield, which is not in the same price ballpark, is probably only important for those who were actually interested in a Shield in the first place. I have an Amazon Fire stick that is almost never used. Amazon thinks they're too special (like Apple), and I refuse to encourage their walled garden by buying their "media." I still can't really tell if Roku is Chromecast compatible. I only find sites trying to make it be a Chromecast. For me, deal breaker. If Xiaomi doesn't abandon the product and provides updates, I think it's well worth the money. harryposter You make a Xiaomi what you want it to be, it's not a stupid Chromestick Andy Roid None of these android boxes can do Netflix in 1080p let alone 4k. Netflix doesn't allow it. You need a Roku or games console to get the high def streams, the android devices are limited to 720p Cuvis Devices that use Android TV (like this one) can. You're thinking of those shitty boxes by no-name companies that shoehorn standard Android onto a TV. harryposter You are a fucking idiot Andy, my Droid box does 1080p on Netflix and even 4k on other sources... And why do you need 4k netflix on your box if it's already available on your TV? Andy Roid Absolute bullshit. The box may output 1080p but Netflix will not supply it with a 1080p signal. You get 480p max which the box has to upscale. Netflix will not deliver HD video to a non-certified box harryposter Andy, all my android boxes are limited to 4K... Faheem Ahmed we need new nvidia sheild harryposter You need go to school first Richard Markert I have a shield and a mi box. Neither one is used for gaming, and they both do Netflix, Plex, vudu, Sling and YouTube exactly the same. Sure the fit and finish is better with the shield, but it better be - I can buy two Mi boxes for one shield. It's not, imo, worth a double price premium, though. Frankly, if the mi box had been out when I got my shield, I'd have two mi boxes. UberCrew For me it is well worth the extra price. The extra horse power is a great to have. Plus I get a gigabit ethernet port which is more reliable for streaming video and games than even AC Wifi, two USB 3.0 ports which provide more power and 10 x the speed of USB 2.0 ports which means less issues with newer external drives, and a microSD card slot for adoptable storage. For me that is worth paying the premium. For others the Mi Box may be good enough. Richard Markert Different people have different reasons. I don't have ethernet anywhere near my bedrooms, so I don't need the ethernet port. I don't use local media with it, so the USB 3 ports are glorified chargers. And I dont play games, so I don't need the storage. Tod Leamon I do actually have Amazon Prime on my Shield TV. UberCrew Me too. harryposter And? harryposter Because you pay for it El Shmoopo Two questions that always come up and are always hard to get an answer to 1. CEC support? Right now I can control TV, amp and Nexus Player with the stock TV remote, rather than juggling three of them or programming a universal. 2. Will system updates be available once Xiaomi's attention wanders? I've lost count of the "finally the android box that solves All The Problems" boxes that shipped with JellyBean 4.2.2 (or whatever) and are on it to this day. scottalias Amazon Video works fine. http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=3805509&d=1467860700 Horatio Illuminati Love the Mi box so far, but one thing that was really annoying for me was the 'Mi Box Recommends' tile on the home page. Luckily I found the solution here if anyone else is interested: https://www.androidboxreviews.co.uk/how-to-remove-mi-box-recommends/ Paul Rainwater I am suspicious of this Android version, does it have OTA updating, can I install APK files UKTVnow, Mobdro, IptvRstream, Terrarium TV, ShowBox and MegaBox (I no longer waste my time with KODI)? and badly want VOICE Search thats the only reason I would order this. Carolina Sundevils Doesn't stream Netflix or Amazon Prime very well. I'm taking mine back. Sibtain Norain Mi Box or Minix U1 Neo. Which one is better? Doris C. Valdespino I don't have a smart TV, will this work for me? Samuel Clemens Does any know if you can load the newest Xfinity TV app (post Oct 2016) on this thing? In other words does it qualify as an "Android device" in the twisted mind of Comcast. Or is Comcast still playing the "mobile device" game to protect its own X1 set top box? Dejan Bogdanović Does anyone have problems with the Mi Box remote control? Mine works for a while and then it stops. Sometimes it reconnects by itself after a while, sometimes it doesn't. In order to reconnect it, I have to remove batteries and put them back. Simply holding back + home doesn't help. Batteries are fine, a bought a new pack - the same thing happens. Any idea how to fix this? I bought the Mi Box from AliExpress so returning it in order to get a new one isn't really an option. James Hey Michael, thanks for this review. I didn't know about the screenshot key combo haha! I have a question. Can the Mi Box handle and play two (2) A2DP connections at the same time? I only have one here and planning to buy another one for my wife if the Mi Box can handle it. Thanks! steve rogers sans steroids You are very wrong about the nexus player. I've been playing hungry shark and unkilled on it for 2 years. No problems. O had kodi but deleted for the better showbox and cartoon 92nd apps. It has a full browser. I stay on the nexus player gaming and browsing , along 20th is flawless on it as well. Do a little more research before you mention the nexus player again. Ivan Wong Hi, is this Mi Box audio port can support TOSlink optical fiber audio cable? please advise. thanks joey gonza I have the Mi Box. It's fine for streaming . But, only has one USB port and is very picky with the stuff you hook up to it. It will not pair with my bluetooth mini keyboard. It drops connection with my SNES usb controller . It also is not 5.1 compatible. Still a good value at $69.99 because it does play Netflix at 1080P . Plays 4K but you will need a 5 GHZ wireless router. I think, the Amazon Fire is well worth it for $20 more. JustSumGuy after almost 6 months I give the MIBox 3s a score of "almost" the 8gb is too small and no sdslot. I recommend this be on your avoid list. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more if you have to. Szczepan Klimek I am wondering, can the Mi Box run a Google Chrome web browser? Can I use this to visit websites on my TV? When I got the Roku I was surprised it only supported apps but had no internet browser.

He suggested doing something that had never been done before and could potentially upend the $350 billion telecom market. "It can't be so difficult to build our own system," the engineer said, referring to the telecom equipment that sends data across cables and wireless networks, and which the engineer suspected could be made to operate faster and cheaper than the pricey equipment sold by big vendors like Nortel, Huawei, Ericsson, Cisco or Juniper Networks. The engineer was suggesting building the telecom industry's first "white box" transponder, made with off-the-shelf parts such as chips from Broadcom and Acacia Communications, optical equipment from Lumentum, and software from one of the many new networking startups cropping up these days. Facebook's director of engineering Hans-Juergen Schmidtke, who was among those on the couch that day, was at first a naysayer. "I was a little bit skeptical about it at the time," he recounted to Business Insider. As a former engineer at Juniper Networks, Schmidtke knew from experience that building telecom equipment systems was an expensive undertaking that involved hiring teams of specially trained engineers and sizeable R&D budgets.  "Building a system ten years ago was like building a new company," Schmidtke said.  Still, Schmidtke agreed to help this tiny group hack together a white box system at one of Facebook's famous hackathons. Three months later they had a working prototype. Six months later, on November 1, they announced it to the world as a real product called Voyager.  The product’s unveiling sent shockwaves through the telecom industry, putting gear makers on notice that the lucrative market they controlled for decades was about to get turned upside down — and not necessarily to their advantage. While the effort is essentially a side-project for Facebook, a social networking company whose bread-and-butter business is online advertising, the stakes could not be higher for the telecom equipment companies which risk seeing their specialized products reduced to interchangeable commodities and their influence diminished.  For the industry’s established companies, there’s unease about Facebook’s growing clout and its ultimate intentions. But in a sign of how serious Facebook’s foray is being taken, there’s already a recognition by some that the repercussions could be even more painful it they don’t adapt. Voyager has already been tested by Facebook and European telecom company Telia over Telia’s thousand-kilometer-telecom network. Plus, German telecom equipment maker ADVA Optical Networking is manufacturing the device and, as of a few weeks ago had nine customers trying it out for their telecom needs, a mix of big telecom companies and enterprises, it said. And Paris based telecom provider, Orange is also testing the device, working with Equinix and African telecom company MTN. "We pulled it off essentially showing that when a few engineers can build a system within six months, the world has changed," Schmidtke said. One person told us that Schmidtke, who is insanely proud of Voyager, has become a star in his own corner of the tech world. When he and his team "go to conferences, they treat him like a tech celebrity, like a rock band," that person said. From one cult to another Voyager was the first product, and a major proving point, for Facebook's young Telecom Infrastructure Project (TIP), a consortium led by Facebook and launched at the industry's worldwide gathering, Mobile World Congress, on February 21, 2016. Read More View photos Facebook Hans Juergen SchmidtkeMore (Hans Juergen SchmidtkeFacebook) TIP is a spin-off from a similar organization Facebook launched a few years ago called the Open Compute Project (OCP). Facebook launched OCP and TIP because it had to take control over the technology it uses to support over 1.8 billion people uploading billions of photos, videos and updates every day. It has been designing its own IT equipment for years, things like computer servers, hard drives/storage systems and data center networks. Its versions were cheaper to build and easier to maintain than standard gear made by companies like Dell, HP, EMC and Cisco, it says.  Lots of big internet companies build their own tech, including Amazon and Google. But Facebook is unusual in that it openly shares all the designs, literally gives them all away for free, inviting anyone at any other company to come work on them, with contract manufacturers standing by to sell it all. It's a concept called open source hardware. In this way, Facebook gets lots of help in maintaining and advancing its infrastructure. And the rest of the world gets access to tech designed to work in the most demanding circumstances, like at a huge internet company. OCP has radically changed the data center tech industry and those involved say it has created a cult-like following. For instance, when secretive Apple refused to join OCP to let its IT engineers collaborate with others, it's crew of network engineers quit their jobs. They turned around and launched a startup called SnapRoute and built network software for the OCP community, the story goes. Apple later joined OCP. SnapRoute wound up being the software chosen for Voyager. OCP created so much competetion for hardware vendors like Hewlett Packard and Dell that they opted to join the organization and embrace the white box concept. The alternative was to be squeezed out of selling their products to companies with the biggest and fastest-growing data centers in the world, not just Facebook, but Microsoft, Goldman Sachs and dozens of others. There was just one major area that had been somewhat left out of OCP's free and open source hardware revolution, the telecommunications part. That's the equipment that connects homes, businesses and data centers together across long distances, via undersea cables, wireless networks, and so on. View photos Facebook Jay ParikhMore (Jay ParikhFacebook) And the big telecom companies, those that spend millions of dollars a year on this gear, wanted in. They needed an OCP of their own, Facebook discovered when it launched its Internet.org, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's project to bring internet to underdeveloped countries. "As we were thinking about Internet.org and helping get more people connected, the idea was, we're doing this thing called OCP to help the data center community to build infrastructure that's more efficient, more cost effective, that's greener and more sustainable, more flexible. And we said, can we do that for the telco industry?" said Facebook's VP of engineering Jay Parikh. "Facebook, having learned from OCP, comes in and says, we can play maybe a catalyzing function," Parikh said, describing early meetings he and his crew had at Mobile World Congress. "We're investing our people and our dollars into technology that is going to solve these problems and we're going to contribute that technology, that IP [intellectual property] into the ecosystem so that you all can benefit from this." Voyager is one big example. "That's something we developed and it's like, wow, we actually solved a problem that a bunch of operators seem to be struggling with," he said. Signing on huge partners South Korea Telecom's CTO Alex Choi agrees that telecom operators like SKT want faster, cheaper and more open equipment and were inspired by Facebook to take it into their own hands. View photos SKT Dr. Alex ChoiMore (Dr. Alex Choi, CTO, Executive Vice President and head of South Korea Telecom's corporate R"The idea all started from Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg was always addressing the importance of connecting the unconnected," Choi said.  In 2015 and 2016, Zuckerberg came to the MWC conference, gave keynote speeches and hung out with top telecom executives. He wanted to know what was keeping those people off the internet. He discovered that bringing telecom services to far-out parts of the world "was too expensive," for telecom operators, Choi recalls. Facebook wanted to help bring the costs down. But developed nations in Europe, Asia and the Americas had the same problem. People are buying more devices, using more video. And with the Internet of Things, millions more objects are joining the internet daily, communicating over telecom networks. "There's a huge growing traffic demand. That means we have to install more base stations, find more sites, invest more in the fiber and the backbone and supporting IT infrastructure," Choi said. But telcos can't charge more to cover the costs. People are are pushing them to charge less, for unlimited data plans. View photos mark zuckerberg mobile world congressMore (BARCELONA, SPAIN - MARCH 02: Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg walks onto the stage prior to his keynote conference during the first day of the Mobile World Congress 2015 at the Fira Gran Via complex on March 2, 2015 in Barcelona, Spain.David Ramos/Getty Images) While Zuck didn't do the actual recruiting to get TIP off the ground, he "inspired people" Choi said. When Facebook executives approached him about forming the new organization, (including Aaron Bernstein, responsible for partnerships with mobile providers, and Jason Taylor, Facebook's vice resident of infrastructure who leads OCP), Choi liked the idea so much, he became the chairman of the TIP organization. It felt revolutionary. OCP has invented lots of cool new hardware for the data center and telecom operators had never banded together to build their own gear, he said. "Operators rely too much on the big telco incumbent vendors. We kept pushing the vendors to do more innovations, to do something to bring down their premium price tag. They are making efforts and making progress but not as fast as we want them to be. So what can you do? You explore other opportunities," he said. Deutsche Telekom's Axel Clauberg was in a similar boat. He first got in touch with Facebook in 2015 about participating with OCP's networking efforts. There had been a push for more telcos to join OCP at that time because Facebook has been helping usher in a new way to build computer networks. It takes all the fancy, complex features out of the hardware and put them into software. In the corporate network world this push is called software-defined networking (SDN). But it's happening in the telecom service provider world, too, where its called Network Function Virtualization or NFV. Facebook didn't invent SDN or NFV, but in the slow and conservative world of network engineering, OCP and TIP are radically pushing these concepts forward. OCP is proving the technology works even for a huge demanding internet site like Facebook or for a giant telecom network like AT&T. "We are facing exponential traffic growth," explains DT's Clauberg. "We needed to do something." And there's one more issue going on besides tight budgets and huge growth, he said: the war for talent. Decades ago, hardware and communications engineers went to the telcos to build amazing new things, like mobile networks. Then they went to the tech companies like Cisco to build the tech that created the internet. Today, they are going directly to the internet companies like Google and Facebook and creating new hardware so they don't have to rely on the vendors, he said. TIP gives them a way to access the smartest minds, without having to poach them. "When [engineers] come out of the universities, which companies are they looking at? In old days, it was the telcos, then it was the suppliers, now it's the internet companies. The funny thing is with OCP, you have all these parties working together. I envision achieving the same [with TIP]. So having players from internet companies, from startups and established vendors, and the telcos, working together on what the infrastructure of the future should look like." DT's Clauberg joined TIP as a founding board member, alongside SKT's Choi. This was a powerful first step. SDK and DT are two of the most advanced telcos in the world, role models for many others. Facebook also convinced Intel's Caroline Chan to join TIP, which was an easy sell. Intel is also a founding member of OCP. And TIP was off and running. But there was one surprise founding member of TIP: Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec. The brave choice of Nokia Telecom devices that can be put together with standard parts and software are deeply threatening to the multibillion telecom equipment market dominated by companies like Huawei Technologies, Ericsson, Cisco, ZTE, and Nokia. View photos Deutsche Telekom Axel ClaubergMore (Vice President and CTO at Deutsche Telekom AG Axel ClaubergYouTube/GEN15) And Voyager isn't the only product. TIP's OpenCellular project is working on an open source 4G LTE/LTE base station, the hardware and the software.    As SKT's Choi describes it, TIP wants to "democratize" the technology, making it easier for anyone to build, use, or modify. That means taking it out of the hands of the equipment providers who create proprietary radios and base stations today. TIP's impact won't happen overnight, explains analyst Rohit Mehra, vice president of IDC's Network Infrastructure practice. But the goal is clear: to overhaul the telecom equipment industry which he says is about a $350 billion market today, when factoring in software, hardware and services. "This is not the first time Facebook has done this. They've been somewhat successful with what they call OCP," Mehra says. "The Telecom Infrastructure Project is disruptive not just to telecom equipment makers but in some cases the telecom service providers. Though in some cases it helps the service providers because it intends to give them more cost-effective infrastructure." So TIP is, in some ways, threatening Nokia's main telecom business. But Nokia is a close partner of Facebook and the one telecom equipment vendor embracing TIP as a founding member and board member. Nokia's Laurent Le Gourrierec explains why, via an adaptation of Abraham Lincoln's famous quote. "The best way to predict the future is to invent it," he tells Business Insider. "You have all these equipment makers saying, 'The world is changing so let's try to hold on to what we know.' But the thing is that the world is changing anyway, so it's much better to take an active role in shaping the future." If all goes well, TIP and Facebook will actually help create new customers using new telecom services, those people in undeveloped nations that never had telecom or internet, Le Gourrierec believes. "So it's best to participate in the definition of new partnerships, new services in partnership with the existing actors in addition to the new ones," Le Gourrierec said. From spies to community members When Facebook created Voyager, Nokia didn't shake in fear. Engineers there thought, "Maybe we can learn something for this," Le Gourrierec said. But there are other equipment makers who are, technically, part of TIP too. Currently the organization boasts over 100 members from all facets of the industry.  But Choi, Clauberg and Le Gourrierec said that many of them have only been nervously watching the group so far. View photos Laurent Le GourrierecMore (Laurent Le Gourrierec, VP Strategic Partnerships at NokiaNokia) "They are not actively contributing," Le Gourrierec said. Obviously, the kumbaya concept of open source doesn't work well like that. Everyone has to contribute their ideas for a community to blossom. One way that TIP is encouraging them to jump in is a different approach to sharing intellectual property. Participants don't have to share all their closely held, lucrative ideas and secrets for free like they do with OCP, or with other open source organizations, like Linux. Each working group in TIP can instead decide to use an older, more established method for sharing, known as Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory Terms (RAND). RAND allows vendors to be paid tiny fees by everyone who uses their intellectual property as long as those fees are reasonable and the tech is made available to everyone without bias. The company can't, for instance, jack up the price to its competitors.  The TIP board members are also encouraging participation by telling members that TIP will lead to plenty of other new commercial opportunities, too, even if TIP successfully turns the hardware into low-cost generic white boxes. Teleco providers can instead develop new software that can be bought via lucrative subscriptions, similar to the software startups that have sprouted up around OCP. In fact, Nokia is already experimenting with a high-performance software product able to run on low cost, ordinary computer network hardware. It's geared toward businesses, not service providers, but it's a start, Le Gourrierec tells us. TIP is also encouraging engineers and companies to join by creating a "culture" working group that helps teach telecom engineers how to "work fast and break things" as the internet world does.  "One of things we learned in the last 1.5 years in working on TIP is people saying, 'How do you help me transform my culture and my team so that we can move faster?'" Facebook's Parikh said.  Telecom is a world that traditionally frowned on that. Working fast and breaking things could take down the network and get you fired.  The culture group has become a popular entry point for engineers wanting to check out TIP. They then bring these ideas back to their jobs. It helps some engineers become more open minded about sharing. For others, like Le Gourrierec, it inspires "a new sense of urgency," in his work at Nokia, he describes. Afraid of Facebook  We only heard one major criticism regularly lobbed at TIP: that Facebook is becoming extremely powerful. Maybe too powerful. After Facebook launched Voyager, Facebook dominated the gossip at the last Mobile World Congress, sources told us. View photos Facebook Voyager optical network deviceMore (Facebook Voyager optical network deviceFacebook) There's good reason to worry. Facebook is making equipment with TIP and OCP, it's got state-of-the-art data centers, it has a roster of talented engineers and it's also laying its own telecom cable, including a new record-breaking fast subsea cable installed with Nokia between New York and Ireland. It could snap its fingers and become a powerful telecom and cloud operator tomorrow, some people fear (and others predict) like Amazon did with Amazon Web Services or Google did with Google Cloud and Google Fiber. But Parikh said that Facebook has zero interest in doing that. "We aren’t operating any networks ourselves. We are trying to help the telcos solve this," he said. The idea is to "share" lessons and technology to "always benefits" the whole community. SKT's Choi just shrugs off the idea that Facebook is a threat, saying telecom operators have more to gain than to lose. "I can understand the concern. It's very much natural, because operators are always being disrupted," he said, especially by large American internet companies "like Amazon, Google, and Facebook." View photos Facebook OpenCellular access pointMore (Facebook's OpenCellular access pointFacebook TIP) "But in the long run, I strongly believe in mutual benefits," he said. He notes that because Amazon helped create cloud computing, there are brand new billion-dollar markets and "everyone benefits. I think the same thing will happen in the teleco sectors." Not everyone is convinced that TIP will succeed. IDC's Mehra cautions that it's a huge undertaking and the two biggest telecom equipment vendors, Ericsson and Huawei, have remained cool toward the project, for obvious reasons, he says. "TIP may see progress over the years. But the challenges are higher. They are working on four to five different domains of telecom infrastructure, each with its own set of technologies and own set of tech providers," Mehra says. All the board members of TIP admit the project is in its early days and could fail. It could fail to attract a community. It could fail to produce products the world wants to use.  But they believe it will succeed. "Today most telecos remain as the status quo but all the telcos leadership, if you ask them, they want transformation. They want changes. They want innovation. They have to overcome it by collaborating with Facebook and others," he said. "Again, witness all the innovations that have already happened in the cloud industry. We want to apply all those innovations to the telco industry, which will make operators happier and customer happier and for everyone, a win/win."  Related: For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available on iOS and Android.

Google's Dave Burke: The first rule of Fuchsia is you don't talk about Fuchsia Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/19 11:32am PDTMay 19, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 235 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares324 Android OS News People have been buzzing about Google's Fuchsia project, an open source operating system that popped up on GitHub a few months ago. Some have even speculated that Fuchsia could be a replacement for Android down the road. Someone brought this up at the Android Fireside Chat, and VP of engineering for Android Dave Burke replied by basically not talking about Fuchsia. Here's the full transcript of Dave's answer from the above video. How do you spell Fuchsia? Fuchsia is a[n] early stage experimental project. We, you know, we actually have lots of cool early projects at Google. I think what's interesting here is its open source, so people can see it and comment on it. Like lots of early stage projects it's gonna probably pivot and morph. There's some really smart people on it, people we've worked with who are great. and so [it's] kind of exciting  to see what happens. But it's definitely a diff-- sort of independent project to android. and yeah, that's basically it. So, there's not much there, is there? Basically, we don't talk about Fuchsia. There's only a little useful information, which will hopefully calm everyone down. The gist seems to be that Fuchsia is still very early, and it's likely to change a lot before it ever gets close to being a real product. And importantly, it's independent from Android. In that respect, it was a little weird to ask the Android team about Fuchsia at all. Tags Android Fuchsia io17 io2017 video subscribe ...

Fuchsia is to Android as Singularity was to Windows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(operating_system) needa A little off subject. Any news of assistant, or a decent GNow version on Chrome? Or wait for Fuchsia? David Hyman I can't wait for assistant to come to Chrome. I also really hope they bring android apps to chrome too, not chrome OS but chrome proper. Those two things would be awesome Spencer Google released the Assistant SDK recently so someone could probably wrap the Assistant into a Chrome extension 🤔 David Hyman I am hoping someone actually does that! In fact that's what I tried to do, but my code skills are awful! boop Android apps aren't built into Chrome on Chromebooks, but in the underlying Linux implementation, parallel to Chrome. So I can't see that ever happening. David Hyman They are in a container though so maybe it's possible! I'm gonna hold my breath just in case! Timbets Title gives an impression that it is an actual quote Artem Russakovskii If we added quotes, maybe. But otherwise, it's an editorialized title with a clear movie reference. Bartek Juszczak It still seems like David Burke is making the reference David Especially when the same reference has been used before by Googlers themselves when talking about Android. No big deal in the title IMHO though. Kellijerickson Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Teja Didn't you see Fight Club? Alvin I wouldn't say if I did. Peter Miller Yeah, but I, too, thought that the Google VP might had made a reference to fight club or at least said something like that he/Google won't talk about it or that its secret or whatever, but he simply answered that its an early project and that he and his team are not responsible for it. abc Yeah, but it was a very forgettable movie. Miku is Best Vocaloid Edwart Norton and Brad Pitt are the same guy. mola2alex Dammit, was going to watch it tonight, thanks a lot Artem Russakovskii That was a jerk thing to do. I deleted his comment. Zeek Hahahahahaha instinct I didn't think for a second that was really a quote. Mahdi Only time will tell... Stephen Sharp I'm glad they are independent. Would like to see Android continue using Linux as they are my two favorite things lol. Plus, Desktop Android + Wayland + Bash is all I ever need abqnm Ah, so like many Google projects, this one will also be schizophrenic. Nick Cannon What's the big deal? Fuchsia is a project that will be released in beta and Google will later kill off mola2alex Or have 5 of them existing all at once competing with each other with overlapping features and Target markets James Donut That's unlikely since they already invested alot of time and resources developing it. makapav Hangouts? Orkut? Google+? James Donut Orkut is replaced by Google+, Google+ is still maintained, as well as Hangouts h4rr4r Hangouts is living on borrowed time. It is losing sms support and duo and allo will replace it because they have more stickers. James Donut Nope, Hangouts will not fade away. Out of the 3 google message platform, it's the only one that has link to a google account (the other 2 relies on Mobile # as identification)... Btw, stickers can be easily added by google, it's not a big of a problem h4rr4r Tell that to Google. I keep trying to use Hangouts and they keep removing features. Stickers are dumb, I was mocking Google. Cheer Chunhao Nah not really, it will go pass the beta stage and be commercially available. Only 2 years later that they will silently abandon it. Lord Argyris Still looks like Vileplume. jm9843 "But it's definitely a diff-- sort of independent project to android." Translation: it's an independent project that will include binary compatibility with Android. And as such, may have the capacity to one day replace it. fahadayaz I heard exactly the same thing makapav He's basically scared of his job and has his fingers in his ears ;-) HiroRoshi Some tidbits about it here. IE, not Linux based. http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/Googles-New-Mobile-OS-Will-Have-a-Distinctly-Non-Linux-Hue-84535.html MeCampbell30 Meh, planning for the future of computing.

Adam Margeson His is more cohesive than Trump's. Trump's speeches tend towards a 3rd grade literacy level. But, yeah. The denial and deflection was just as apparent. Hexlattice Couldn't have put it better myself. And glad you saw what I meant by my op James Donut Android is the Present.... Fuchsia is the Future Denholm Willmer fuchsiapolice.com instinct YOU PIVOT. Jay Just like how they're not talking about their messaging problem. Dustin Boyd Clickbaity title? Check! What we've seen so far has been buggy and incomplete, to the point that I wouldn't even call it an alpha release. Why respond to hype with info that may change at some point before a proper reasonably solid release? Perhaps we learned nothing from all the hype surrounding Windows Vista's release so many years ago (WinFS anyone?) abc The first rule is that Fuchisa is crap that will either never be released, or like other Google products released and subsequently abandoned. I will enjoy the fanboys masturbating to it though. b0b Google science project abandoned in .... 1 .... 2 .... 3. Paul M Power consumption is going to be a problem - we'll need 1.21 jiggawatts to get back to the fuchsia. Lord Ravenor I wonder if this will just wind up being the front-end system for Google Home/Google Home with a display? Roh_Mish Knowing google, they might very well keep both android and fuchsia development going on in parallel in future too. Or it might be an eventual replacement for Android Go, Chromecast, google home, android Auto, wear and other non phone ventures from google. Considering how locked down and API centric all these products are google can eventually move away from android based OS to fuchsia for them since almost no native code from app devs are run on these devices natively (well except for go) and if done right could mean these devices get Bette reithout breaking any of the apps on these devices. It's hard for Android since unless you are willing to bring everything from Android back to fuchsia you can't run every app on it and if you do then this project is meaningless. h20ray https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9e27f15b4ed7d193926bea66197042bced4e97d0b9a96192923ebfe77c18661.png ddevito Bullshit.

After a nervous first 45 minutes, Liverpool eased to the victory that ensures they will play in the Champions League qualifiers next season. They fully deserve it for an erratic but often exhilarating season’s work, and you suspect there will be a glory night or two at Anfield in the competition next season. Congratulations to Liverpool and City, commiserations to Arsenal. Thanks for your company throughout the Premier League season, bye!

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.45am EDT 11:45 87 min “Shooooooooooot” scream the crowd as Lucas receives the ball 20 yards inside his own half.

Updated at 11.45am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.43am EDT 11:43 86 min Alberto Moreno comes on for James Milner, perhaps also for a farewell appearance. Lucas takes the captain’s armband, a nice touch. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.42am EDT 11:42 84 min The crowd urge Lucas to shoot every time he gets the ball. Instead he contributes repeatedly to a patient passing move, until the ball is moved wide to Milner. He sidefoots a terrific first-time cross that skims right across the face of goal.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.39am EDT 11:39 82 min Negredo lofts a very good pass over the defence for Forshaw, who watches the ball over his shoulder but then drags his volley wide of the far post. He probably should have scored. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.37am EDT 11:37 78 min Roberto Firmino comes off to be replaced by Lucas Leiva, the admirable old pro who may be playing his last game for Liverpool.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.30am EDT 11:30 71 min “If, as a keeper, you plant yourself in the middle at a free-kick,” begins Stuart Ives, “A) you blind yourself from the wall; B) often you’ll leave you weak side exposed.” Yes, fair point. What I meant, and conspicuously failed to say, is that I don’t understand why keepers plant their weight on one foot. That’s the real problem, not the positioning. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.28am EDT 11:28 70 min Lallana’s deflected shot is comfortably saved by Guzan, whose kick downfield stays in the field of play! (And goes straight to Lovren.) Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.28am EDT 11:28 69 min “Guzan can’t keep it in the field of play,” says Joe Pearson. “Honestly, how many has he kicked directly out?

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.25am EDT 11:25 67 min Firmino plays a slick one-two with Lallana on the left and dinks a clever, flashy little ball into Wijnaldum, who slashes an acrobatic volley wide of the far post. Liverpool have played some terrific stuff since the 45th minute, with the marvellous Firmino involved in almost all their best moves. Updated at 11.26am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.24am EDT 11:24 66 min Liverpool will be dangerous outsiders in the Champions League. Their big-game record under Jurgen Klopp is tremendous, and even the best European teams won’t enjoy being harassed under the lights at Anfield. The worry for Liverpool is how it might impact upon their league form, especially as their squad isn’t the strongest. Updated at 11.24am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.22am EDT 11:22 64 min Coutinho frees Firmino in the box. His first touch is fractionally heavy, and then he tries to flick it back to Wijnaldum rather than shoot. It was nice improvisation but a Boro defender came across to clear. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.21am EDT 11:21 63 min “Why do goalkeepers try and guess on free kicks?” says Hugh Molloy. “Just stand in the middle and you’ll save all but the best, stand on one side and play games and you can get beaten by mediocrity.” Agreed, it’s an odd and illogical approach. Peter Schmeichel often did it as well, especially in the Nou Camp. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.20am EDT 11:20 62 min “Third goal, and I still can’t relax,” weeps Matt Dony. “This is what Liverpool have done to me when playing lower-down teams.

Coutinho, in the D, flips the ball up and hits a low volley that is fingertipped round the post by Guzan. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.16am EDT 11:16 The goal came from a Middlesbrough corner. Liverpool broke, with five against two at one stage, only for Lallana to mishit his attempted pass. It didn’t matter because the ball was kept alive by Liverpool and Lallana burst into the area to receive Wijnaldum’s headed pass before sliding the ball across Guzan with his left foot.

Discuss. (20 marks). Enjoying (read: enduring) the stream.” I got 28 per cent in a Geography exam the morning after Man Utd beat Arsenal 6-2 at Highbury in 1990. The two were not entirely unrelated. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.10am EDT 11:10 53 min Firmino’s vicious volley is heroically blocked by Friend. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.09am EDT 11:09 That was a fine free-kick. Guzan and everyone else expected Coutinho to aim for the near side, the top-right corner; instead he wrapped his foot around the ball and whipped a bouncing free-kick into the bottom-left corner. Guzan might still have got there, but it was a lovely, disguised strike.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.06am EDT 11:06 49 min The early signs are that Liverpool won’t be sitting on their one-goal lead, which is surely the right approach. If this is 1-0 up after 85 minutes, it’ll be squeaky-bum time in excelsis. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.05am EDT 11:05 48 min Jurgen Klopp literally started beating his own chest when Wijnaldum scored. I have no idea what to make of that. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.03am EDT 11:03 47 min “Is It just me, or did Danny Sturridge look decidely grumpy to not be played in by Wijnaldum EVEN AFTER THE BALL CROSSED THE LINE?” says Drew Gough. “I picture him spending half time mumbling ‘shoulda been me’.” Oh, I missed that. Sounds quite out of character though. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.03am EDT 11:03 46 min Peep peep!

Firmino, with his back to goal, flicked the ball smartly round the corner to Wijnaldum, who surged into the box onto his own superb first touch and screamed a rising shot past Guzan at the near post. That came right off the sweet spot. Updated at 10.54am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.46am EDT 10:46 GOAL!

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.43am EDT 10:43 44 min Another nervous moment for Liverpool as Bamford breaks into the box on the right. He tried to abracadabra his way past Matip, with almost no room to play with by the touchline, and failed. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.42am EDT 10:42 43 min Manchester City have done their work: they lead Watford 4-0 and will be finishing third in the table. Ten-man Arsenal still lead Everton 2-0. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.42am EDT 10:42 41 min Middlesbrough are having an even share of the game at the moment. The nervousness around the ground is almost surreal. It’s Middlesbrough at home! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.40am EDT 10:40 40 min “Can you play Ally’s Army at half-time?” requests Alun Pugh. “Anfield: that’s the venue of the infamous Joe Jordan handball in 1977 that cheated Wales out of a place in the World Cup Finals. I was singing “Ally’s Army” and laughing all through the 1-3 Peru match. Not that Welsh fans hold grudges or are bitter, mind.” If you can’t bring up a grudge in an almost entirely unrelated match 40 years later, then when can you? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.39am EDT 10:39 39 min Some more relaxed, penetrative football from Boro. Friend meanders forward, plays a one-two with Gestede and then backheels the ball into the area for Bamford. He tries to make room for a shot that deflects behind for Boro’s first corner. Mignolet punches it clear. Updated at 10.41am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.37am EDT 10:37 36 min Lallana shoots unnecessarily and optimistically from long range, bringing another comfortable save from Guzan. The crowd are so nervous, and that has definitely started to affect the players, who are shooting way too often from distance. They just need to keep their nerve, there is loads of time and they should only need one goal. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.35am EDT 10:35 34 min Lallana almost makes something out of nothing, picking up a loose ball and surging into the area. Gibson tracks him all the way and concedes a corner, the first of the match. Excellent defending.

Coutinho feeds a gentle ball into Sturridge, who turns smartly and drives a right-footed shot just wide from 15 yards. Jurgen Klopp growls and punches the air at the fans, asking for more noise. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.32am EDT 10:32 32 min I’m at a loss to explain why Liverpool are playing so modestly.

You want to eat some of the best food of your life, on the road, in a car with the windows rolled down. You want to feel free. Unfortunately, when you have to eat gluten-free, travel is rarely that spontaneous. You never know if you're going to find much you can eat in a gas station off the highway (Fritos are gluten-free). Walk into a diner in the middle of the country and you might be met with confused stares when you ask to see a gluten-free menu. You're hungry. This trip isn't what you expected. Here are my five essential tips to ensure a great and filling vacation. 1. Make a plan. If you were once the kind of person to throw a backpack in the car and head out on the road without much warning, you're going to have to change your ways. You're not Jack Kerouac. You're going to have to plan ahead so you don't go hungry or get sick. Plotting routes on a map — oh, who am I kidding? The GPS on your phone — is important; knowing where you are going to stay and where you are going to eat is much more vital. The days of the annual guidebook to a region are probably gone. They're certainly not useful when planning where to eat without gluten. Before I go anywhere, I spend an hour or two on Google, researching gluten-free places in the towns we are going to visit. What are the restaurants that keep showing up? Are there any bed and breakfasts with gluten-free owners? Is there a family owned barbecue joint where they make everything from scratch? It might have gluten-free options. I make a list. Apps & Resources for Gluten-Free Travel To be honest, most of the GF apps are pretty poor, since so many of them point to chain restaurants. Not my thing! Find Me Gluten-Free is the best of the bunch. I completely rely on Google Maps for mapping GF locations. You can do all the work on your desktop or laptop and then your saved locations will show up on your phone. I also lean on some of the gluten-free forums on Rick Steves' — but it's only helpful if you're going to Europe! 2. Tap into social media. In addition to Google, I also take to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to ask. Gluten-free folks are always eager to help each other out. The best meals we've eaten on the road came from suggestions from readers of our site, not the guidebooks or official apps. You might also consider looking for "healthy living" bloggers wherever you're traveling. Check out their Instagram feed — if they post some good-looking gluten-free stuff (they almost always note #glutenfree), you can use the save function on Instagram to bookmark the spot.

If you're traveling by airplane, there will be nothing for you to eat once you board. (That's pretty much true for most people these days, gluten-free or not.) Pack your own grain salads, homemade jam bars, or even a couple of apples and packages of cheese. Airports are better at gluten-free options than they were a decade ago, but some of them are pretty barren. I always have a small bag full of snacks that last — granola bars, nuts, dried fruits, jerky, and popcorn or chips — in case I land in a place where there's nothing to eat. If we're traveling by car, we pack a cooler full of food in the trunk for the trip. Heck, eating is cheaper that way too.

The great thing about having a plan is that you can always veer off your plan. Think of it as insurance rather than an itinerary that is set in stone. We were driving between Missoula and Whitefish, Montana last year on a winter road trip. We stayed at a generic hotel with not much local flavor. When we asked the young guy at the front where we could eat breakfast the next morning, his face lit up. "Betty's Diner!" he said, excitedly. A young woman came out from the room behind him to say, "Oh yes, Betty's! It's great." The next morning, we drove by it on the highway that skirted the lake. Hungry, we pulled in. I scanned the menu, worried nothing would be gluten-free. When I asked the young server, she said, "Oh, it's all gluten-free. All of it." Turns out the owner has celiac, so she switched everything to gluten-free ingredients. That French toast was amazing. 5. Splurge on the good restaurants. The unexpected diner in Montana was a gorgeous surprise. Most times, however, the best restaurant in town is the likeliest place to have gluten-free food I can truly eat. Find the restaurant that uses local ingredients and changes its menu for the seasons. Extra points if the place is owned by the chef. When we're traveling, we either have picnics or a quite lavish meal. Hint: Breakfast is the least expensive way to splurge and fill yourself up for the day. Do you or someone you know have celiac disease? What are your best tips for making your gluten-free travels safe and delicious?

The current Google Pixel/Pixel XL will support Project Treble, possibly meaning longer support Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 8:03pm PDTMay 18, 2017 89 Plus 1 on G+ 220 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares383 Android O Android OS Google News Pixel Pixel XL There are a few reasons why your phone or tablet stops getting Android updates. One reason could be that the maker of your device's processor (e.g. Qualcomm or MediaTek) never updated the drivers for newer versions of Android. This is why no phones or tablets with the Snapdragon 800/801 chip ever officially received Android 7.0 Nougat, including the Nexus 5. Google announced Project Treble a week ago, which aims to solve this particular problem by separating the Android OS from the 'Vendor interface' (the part with all the low-level drivers and binary blobs). The vendor interface under Project Treble is also designed to be forwards-compatible, meaning that it shouldn't have to be updated for every Android update, in theory. During one of today's Android Fireside Chats at Google I/O, Dave Burke (VP of engineering for Android) revealed that the current Google Pixel and Pixel XL will work with Project Treble. Normally, only phones that ship with Android O will work with Treble, but the Pixel will be an exception. I'm excited to see if this will give the Pixel a longer support period than previous Nexus devices. Google has only promised two years of software updates (and three years of security patches) for the Pixel. Project Treble could extend that even further - we'll have to wait and see.

Paige Turner I'am freelancing on the web, finishing fundamental responsibilities which only demands from you computer system or laptop and additionally internet access and I couldn't be delightful... Six months have surpassed since i initiated this and also i profited until now altogether 36,000 dollars... Basically i earn profits around $80 each hour and work for three to 4 h every day.And great point about this job is that you can actually choose when to work by yourself as well as for how long and you receive money by the end of every week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Bala nice to read , but probably in the next 2 years the device will look outdated on all specs Corbin Davenport The point isn't to keep the Pixel competitive against other phones as time goes on, the point is to continue supporting the people that paid $650+ for it. JohnyNoLegs I feel like those same people will just upgrade in 12 or 24 months anyway. We are talking about one of the most expensive phones on the market. Stephen J Huh? We're talking about a phone comparable in price to every other flagship in 2016.. "One of the most expensive"? Maybe, but it is in good company. JohnyNoLegs Well in AUS it's the most expensive android phone you can buy right now. EowynCarter Well, I spent some bucks on my Nexus 6. But, paying for an expensive phone, one of my expectation is that it last a few years indeed. zepy3 Of course there will be the group of people that always want the latest phone. Though, if the iPhone market is any example there is a diverse group of people that hold off upgrading for up to 3 generations (6 versions of phones including the S models). Some purposely never purchase the latest generation too. There's a large group of people, myself included that would never ever spend $650, let alone the $800+ for the XL.Only to have it lose software support after 2 years, offering 3 years of security patches is all well and good but Treble being a real thing, longer life for the devices themselves is the only way I can ever justify staying with "Made By Google" phones. JohnyNoLegs Logically if you don't want to spend that much then you should get op3t or mi6 etc. Would be far better if you are pushing your budget/allowance just to think you are getting Google's best. Pixel is an over priced HTC 10 with less features. Trust me, I owned both. HTCthe1st&Best I had both too and I like Htc but even at best Htc will get you system updates in 90 of release which pixels get from day one and beta previews. I bought the pixel xl 128 because Htc never made big enough screens and the fast updates. I will still get the Htc U11 because I like the quality phones that Htc makes. I may even buy the pixel xl 2 when it comes out this fall but yes I would be buying it for the updates mostly and hopefully pixel xl 2 comes with 5.7 or 5.9 screen. If they get the screen to phone ratio better on pixel xl 2 they could get it to 5.9 and not be very much bigger than pixel xl at all. Hopefully they get pixel xl 2 to 5.9, but at least Htc U11 comes with an sd card slot which google could give a rats azz that people want an sd card slot they would rather make you pay $100 more for 128 gb storage that you wouldnt need if it had an sd card slot which with one 32 gb's is fine. JohnyNoLegs Updates are stupid on the Pixel anyway, all they do is break and fix things. Never had this many issues with a phone. I think the Nexus/Pixel line is a beta test, like a test to see if people would spend that much money on an android phone. Perhaps their next phone will be not only be better, but they might get out of the developer mindset and make stable, quality software. HTCthe1st&Best Let me guess you would spend that for a samsung though lol and be an operating system or two behind of the pixels and pay the same price. People that pay the same price for phones that do not get monthly security updates and that thost same phones take 8 months or more to get system updates that pixels already got are just fools buying nothing more than a name or should I say sheep... Knowledgeborn Allah They could hypothetically go hand-in-hand. If Google supports the devices for longer periods of time, it could (in theory, of course) help with long-term resale value. In many circles, people are more than willing to spend $400 on an iPhone 6, even though its specs are clearly outdated, as the device came out almost 3 years ago. If other Android OEMs don't implement that kind of support (and they most likely won't) while Google does, the Pixel could become a commodity that everybody flocks to, especially within the Android space. Bala Im using a pixel xl as of now , the device will run great for years even with nougat installed. Sure i would welcome the move for continued support but I highly doubt any android oem would do that ,for the sake of their business EowynCarter Unless they do, Apple will be the one to get my money. dcdttu Not to my parents! JohnyNoLegs And they will only accept the very latest builds from android, anything less and it's unusable! Dmitry Stepanushkin My dad uses Pentium 3 600 with 256MB RAM and Windows 2000, and it's the fastest PC in the world for him. So, yes :). JohnyNoLegs So he's running windows 10 by that logic then right? Dmitry Stepanushkin For his hardware Windows 2000 is so much better than Windows 10. If You look at numbers, it must be 200 times better at least :-). JG Well of course... 2000 > 10 and the bigger the number, the better, everyone knows that. That's why, for example, 1080p is considerably better than 4k, because both the number and letter are higher. JohnyNoLegs So no issue having no Android updates is the point EowynCarter There's more than just latest version. There are also bug fixes and security patch. JohnyNoLegs Security patches come to nearly all handsets anyway. Bug fixes are due to Pixel/nexus bugs anyay. raazman That's not the point. Nathan J So are many PCs that are still getting updates. Hell I spent something like $300 on my graphics card, and it's not even VR ready. Them's the breaks. But I still get updates from Microsoft. Imagine if computers cut you off after 18-24 months and then told you to buy a new one to be protected from malware and other threats. Never mind the whole Windows 7 crowd, who insist on using 8-year-old system software... Rod As a Nexus 5 user, I doubt that. Dre LOL sure. Duder12 Aww look. We have a Samsung user! Shelly-Man Vol 2 I hope so! Google love doing plot twists though. Dmitry Stepanushkin Yes, for example, they may create new OS and drop Android support :-). Eric Walker Every OS comes to an end Lateef Alabi-Oki 5 years of OS and security updates. That should be Google's commitment to its users and the environment. thebum232323 I concur Nathan J Damned right. If they want to charge iPhone prices, they should match iPhone support. Five years of updates and everyone gets the update regardless of how the manufacturer feels about your carrier or country. Really — and especially with Android, which is more open than the iPhone — your smartphone should just be a dumb piece of hardware that gets updates like your PC. For years and years and it's all the same. And I think that's what Project Treble is going for, if I understand the diagram correctly. If so, it's how I've been saying Android should work since 2012 or so. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... But, even if Google does keep the Pixel phones up-to-date for 5 years or so, a major issue they need to work out is availability. Keeping devices updated for longer doesn't help if people can't actually buy the phones. If they can fix both of those issues, then they'd have a winner. Nathan J It's HTC, they can only make so many. Nexus has always had supply issues though. I think if, next year, we get a Galaxy Pixel, Samsung will have no problems meeting the demand. Stock Android on Samsung hardware, now that Samsung has dug its way out of 2010 hardware design, is the dream. Lucas de Eiroz ™ Samsung would never make phones for Google again. They already are on the top of Android phones sales. Making efforts to produce phones in large scale to another brand wouldn't be a smart move. Nathan J Sadly, you're probably right... which is partly why I said it's the dream phone and not the most likely one. HTC has Pixel for two years, though, that's old news. Nobody wants LG making them as Android bloggers are allowed to talk about LG's bootloops (but, oddly, not HTC's). That pretty much leaves Motorola, as far as OEMs that make phones for the US market (as well as everywhere else). Jeff Coover They don't need to go with a company that makes phones for the US market. The used Huawei for the Nexus and there's no reason they can't do so again. I think it would actually be a good idea. Google could benefit by getting decent price on manufacturing from a company known to have quality manufacturing but that is not running on fumes. Huawei, or other company, would then make money from a new market without it cutting into their own sales. HTCthe1st&Best The Huawei 6p's were nothing but problems many were replaced with pixels by google under warranty. Huawei makes cheap junk which is why they never sell many phones here in the USA. HTCthe1st&Best But google wouldnt want exploding phones any way so neither would want samsung making any pixel line as samsung has enough problems with their own products like their note and washers that can cause physical damages to people using them. Jay Nexus didn't have an issue like this. Not for this long. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... The old Nexus devices may have had limited availability for a couple weeks at most, whereas the Pixel XL has been out of stock almost since its release last year! And, as crazy as it may sound, I saw more people in the wild with the Nexus 6P and Nexus 6 than I've ever seen with the Pixel. I have literally never seen anybody else with a Pixel or Pixel XL, and that makes their constant status of being "out of stock" more confusing than ever. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Keith Stefanec I got a Pixel XL 3 days after they came out! Knowledgeborn Allah That's great news, lol... What does that have to do with availability? If you can purchase a phone within its first week of release, that doesn't say much. I was able to get the Pixel XL when it first came out too. Try ordering one now. Let me know what you find out... 🙄 dogerRodger I skipped the 6 because it wasn't available until at least March Knowledgeborn Allah The Nexus 6? Seriously? 🙄 I find that a little hard to believe, primarily because the Nexus 6 was sold all over the place, not just on the Google Store website. I used to see quite a few people buying them well after their release from Best Buy and T-Mobile. They were displayed in almost every Sprint and AT&T store I went into. In fact, the Nexus 6 was one of the most 'available' Nexus devices ever made. I don't know where you were trying to buy yours, but you could've easily gotten one inside a store. dogerRodger The stores never had the color / size combo I wanted and the Google store was out of stock for months. By the time it was available where I could get what I wanted I'd decided to pass. Knowledgeborn Allah Are you talking about the Nexus 6, or are you referencing a different Nexus device? The Nexus 6 only had one size and, if I remember correctly, it only had two colors: blue and white. The first (and only) Nexus phones to ship at the same time in alternate colors and size configurations were the Nexus 5x and 6p, and I don't think those were sold in any retail stores other than Best Buy... In any case, you're talking about preferences, not availability. The Nexus 6 was stocked so highly when it launched that, when Google realized it wasn't selling in huge quantities, they cut the price almost in half after only a few months! By around the 6 month mark, it was already selling on Amazon for around $200. The carriers kept selling it long after that, though. Sites like eBay were practically giving it away for free. That's not the case with the Pixel at all. Google is still selling it for around $700, and it's not available in any carrier's stores other than Verizon - and, last time I checked, they're out of stock there too! Some people complained about having to wait 6 to 8 weeks to get the iPhone 7 and 7+ after they launched and sold out. People have literally been waiting for the Pixel to get back in stock for months before they can even order it. The details regarding that and whatever Nexus 6 delays there may have been aren't even comparable. dogerRodger the nexus 6 was white/blue. obviously the phone was one physical size but came in 32/64 for storage. stores that i visited only stocked blue/32. the white/64 i wanted wasn't available until at least march. that is a problem with availability, not preference. that phone sold out almost instantly and google promised new stock weekly just so people like me wouldn't give up. Jeff Coover I think that is because Nexus was mostly for developers and enthusiasts which make up a relatively small portion of people buying phones. So it was intentionally made in small amounts so they weren't left with a bunch of extra and it sold out fast as a result. I figure the enthusiasts are the type of people to want to get the phone as quick as possible but demand would drop sharply and make it easier to stock. Nathan J Not this bad, no. We're what, six months on now? This is basically unacceptable. But the Nexus phones all or at least recent ones had early supply issues that shook out after a month or so. Same with the iPhone, actually. Jeff Coover Google is the one designing the hardware though so the Samsung hardware would not come into play. Google is just using HTC as a manufacturer but they have little to no input on the design. That was one of the major differences between the Nexus line, where the hardware was designed by the partner company and the software by Google, and the Pixel line, where the hardware and software are done by Google. So really Samsung might be able to supply to the demand better than HTC but the device would be virtually the same no matter who Google pays to build it. needa I don't think Samsung is an ODM. Even if they are, we will see a Google design. TheScientists That's a nice dream, but we'll never see a Galaxy Pixel. Sammy doesn't need to do that, nor would they want to at this point. roberto.elena If Apple wants to charge Pixel prices, they should match Android features. Nathan J Touché! I could say that Apple has the dedicated fan base and they don't have to, but they're sitting real pretty at about 15% market share. I remember in the '90s, they had about about half that of the PC market and they were comfortable with that. Still, maybe Apple should look for writing on the wall. Like the app gap. They used to lord this over Android when it was in their favor. Now that it's not, we only hear crickets... You may have heard that Apple apps are generally better. This is barely a half truth. While iOS does have certain advantages (fewer devices and resolutions, mostly), I see a lot of abandoned apps in the App Store. Apps I used on both platforms have more features on Android. Like Telegram and OurGroceries — the latter of which I've paid for three times now — can't even figure out a dark theme on iOS whole they're present on Android. And as you may know, there's a sort of voluntary ignorance with iOS users to just kind of pretend everything is okay. Kind of like Android users who pretend Android flagships are comparable in performance to the latest iPhone. A lot of complacent printer on both sides. One reason I got an iPhone. I wanted to know firsthand and stop assuming. 13 months with iOS and I definitely prefer Android, I just don't have much faith in many Android phones. Eric Walker I think one thing he was trying to point out is that even though apple supports their phones for 5 years, after a few years the updates start to lack features that the newer phones are getting. I have first hand experience with this in the case of my iPad mini 1 which technically got iOS 9, but none of the improvements like the new notes app and a lot more things. abc lol. So Apple needs to come out with more malware, less updates, and shit support roberto.elena Enjoy your walled garden, where big brother Apple tells you what you can do with your device. h4rr4r The problem with this is Google and ARM. ARM lacks any sort of PCI like thing, so the kernel needs to know about hardware before boot. Google is a problem because they will not just force drivers into mainline. If Android used GPLed drivers none of this would be a problem. Michael Oghia Kudos to you for considering the enviornment miscfiles That would be great. The only downside is non replaceable batteries. Have you used a phone with a five year old battery? Lateef Alabi-Oki The oldest the Android device I use is the Nexus 7 2013. On Lineage OS, running Nougat, it flies. No battery issues either. As with anything in life, if you don't abuse your devices, and you take good care of them, they reciprocate the favor. miscfiles I've got a Nexus 7 2013 which is also fine, but I can't say I've used it much. My well used Nexus 5 battery was a shadow of its former self before it was two years old, and barely lasted me until lunchtime by 32 months - at which point I replaced it with a Pixel. I wouldn't say I "abused" it, just that I used it quite a lot. zepy3 It's almost as if phones suddenly were supported by software for 5 years, manufactures would have to innovate the hardware to last the same... *magic* :P miscfiles Maybe the long lasting battery tech I keep reading about will actually come to market one day. For five years of service, it'd need to handle 1,500+ charge cycles. Current batteries can lose ~20% in charge after only 400 cycles, and drop off even more steeply after that. A replaceable battery would be easier with today's technology. Lateef Alabi-Oki That's why I keep my devices always plugged when I'm not using them. My Nexus 7 sits on a wireless charging pad permanently when I'm not using it. I can still get a day's worth of battery life out of it. pfmiller My Nexus 10 on the other hand gets about 5 minutes of battery life when I unplug it. h4rr4r The only reason they lose capacity that fast is because of unusually high power density and poor battery management. If the phone never charged above 80% and never allowed a discharge below 20%, you hide it from the user by moving the 0% and 100% locations the batteries would last a lot longer. Phones are so thin these days you could add 1mm back and gain enough battery to implement that change. MJ You mean don't use your devices? I have a Nexus 7 2013 and still have a Nexus 5 which are both in mint condition. I am not a heavy phone user and the tablet is just used to watch Netflix on my TV. Neither battery is worth much now... My Pixel XL can last 2x as long as both together. I would say 5 years of security updates makes sense but 3 years of OS updates is more than enough. One who doesn't care to update their phone probably doesn't car about OS updates. Lateef Alabi-Oki Come on! It's not fair to compare the battery life of a device built on a 14nm chip to one built on a 28nm or larger chip. Of course, your Pixel has better battery life than your Nexus 5. Its SoC is twice as efficient. And I use my Nexus 7 every day. It's my living room companion. Although it is placed permanently on a wireless charging pad when I'm not using it. I don't know why there's an artificial delineation between security updates and OS updates. This is software. An update is an update. In fact, I hate the idea of yearly OS updates. It's mostly marketing BS. I wish Google would switch to a rolling 6-week updates for Android like they do with Chrome, Chrome OS and their Google services. I'd take small incremental regular updates every month over large OS dumps every year. This leads to much more stable and less disruptive releases for users, and fine-tunes Google's continuous integration and deployment process (which is a bloody joke on Android). MJ Thanks for writing a whole essay confirming new phones have better hardware which is why people upgrade. LOL If my Nexus 5 was getting the same battery life when I first bought it that won't be a problem (for me). Batteries deteriorate over time. You must know this... Yearly OS updates are marketing BS? Huh? Six week rolling updates would be more stable? Some Linux distributions do rolling updates so users can have the latest packages and they are NOT known to be stable and break things. Let's adopt this for a consumer product! #facepalm It would be so awesome for Android OEMs to be 10 updates behind now. I can't believe you compared development cycles of apps to operating systems. What's so disruptive when a new Android update comes out? Lateef Alabi-Oki Oh, I thought people upgraded their hardware just for the "lols". Here comes another essay. I used Gentoo Linux for years, it was the most stable Linux distro I'd ever used. In fact, it wasn't until 2 years ago that I switched my server to Fedora. As someone who's used rolling Linux distros, I can say from experience they're more stable. And there's one reason why rolling Linux distros are often more stable than non-rolling Linux distros, superior package management, and testing environments. Rolling Linux distros have extremely good package and dependency management systems. They're so good that's it's virtually impossible to update a package that can cause instability. In fact, an outstanding package manager is the most important prerequisite for a rolling Linux distros or update system. And it's something rolling Linux distros do better than their non-rolling counterparts. I don't want to write another "essay" on the benefits of rolling software updates. You can research the benefits of continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous deployments, or read a book like the Cathedral and the Bazaar for more insights. But research has shown that small, incremental, and continuous updates often result in stable software experiences than periodical code dumps. Why? Because the frameworks that ensure that software systems can be regularly and independently tested, updated, and deployed, also prove that the software being updated has been rigorously tested, is resilient to change and is robust enough to be introduced in any environment. Also small incremental patches are easier to test, manage, and rollback, than large code dumps. The benefits of regular, or rolling updates, are not even the updates themselves. The benefits are the culture it fosters. All parties have to buy into the idea. The testing and deployment frameworks need to be state of the art and on point. Updating software should be second nature and natural to all stakeholders (OEMs, carriers, developers, users). On Linux, nobody blinks twice when there's an OS or kernel update. Same goes for Chrome OS. Or even apps on the Google Play Store. But for some reason, there's always a level of anxiety when it comes to Android OS updates. There's a level of distrust, of angst, of confusion. And the source of all that energy comes from Google. So if Google's Android team can't figure out how to update an OS because they're scared it will break something, it means their build and deployment infrastructure is amateur hour. If it wasn't, we won't be having this conversation about OS and security updates. Meanwhile, my Fedora Workstation updated it's kernel at least 3 times alone in the last month. And that's not even counting how many times core system libraries and packages on it are updated every single day without a single hitch. So, yes, regularly updating an OS and its core system is neither magic nor rocket science. It's a software engineering problem that was solved decades ago. The fact that Google has failed to do it on Android is an embarrassment of the highest order to a company of the caliber of Google. And, even more, an insult the Linux community which their OS is based on, who elegantly solved this problem decades ago. Ammar That's the user's prerogative whether he/she wants to use a phone that way. HeyRadar On my Moto Z I can just keep swapping the battery Mod. needa Till those mods crap out on you. HeyRadar Right. And that's the beauty! I just buy another one and 10 seconds later it's like new. needa No doubt about it, the Z mods being used another year is a good thing. But I am talking about when you can't find one to fit your phone. Kind of like when you can only find a cheap chinese knockoff battery to go in our two year old phone. A battery that new... only has 80% of rated capacity. Happy that you are high on the hog over that moto z, but lets be realistic here. h4rr4r There is no such thing as a non-replaceable battery. They did not place the battery in your phone via teleportation. Batteries can all be replaced, just takes a tiny bit of effort. miscfiles Fair point, but I guess you know that I meant easily removable batteries, like my Galaxy S2 had. h4rr4r Sure, but no battery is really non-replaceable. To many people have learned helplessness. miscfiles I wouldn't expect "the average user" to take their device apart to replace the battery. If nothing else, perhaps Google could provide a reasonably priced battery replacement service. h4rr4r That is the problem right there. You expect helplessness from folks, since our society does, these people to decide they are helpless. You get what you expect. If an a young person in a third world country with little to no training can assemble your phone, if you can afford it odds are you can replace the battery. Screwdrivers, plastic picks and hair dryers are not complicated tools. The kids who do this work at your local mall got little to no training either. miscfiles I've replaced "fixed" phone batteries and USB ports in the past, and I agree that it's not at all hard to do with the right tools. However, I think I'm right in saying that even by opening the case, you've voided the warranty. Sure, nobody would know assuming you didn't make a mistake, but there's definitely room for error there. Would you expect someone like my fictional aunt with poor eyesight to manage those tiny screws and connectors? h4rr4r Why would you do that to a device under warranty? No one would, the warranty would cover the issue. I would expect your fictional aunt to either have glasses, like I do, or to have family members like you. In the worst case your aunt unlike 80% of the population might actually not be capable of replacing battery. However for most folks it is simply learned helplessness. Spencer Walker Sorry of you're rocking a nexus s from 5 years ago but get a new phone John Doe Yes, blame the user not company /s You have about 1.5 BILLION more users to notify LoL How else are people going to buy healthcare? https://youtu.be/wOh9BjQvcAs Spencer Walker While we're at it support the g1 7.0 or riots bitch h4rr4r We don't even get that. John Doe You know what, I was just thinking they can update the G1 to Android Go LoL Colin Richardson My PC is 9½ years old, and cost less than the Pixel phone.. Still getting OS updates.. Though, I do have to pay for an upgrade fee for each major version of Windows.. So maybe not the best analogy. HeyRadar I wouldn't have an issue paying for a new Android on a 3+ year old device. Especially my tablets. If people would pay that would give manufacturers reasons to update their drivers, etc. h4rr4r If drivers were in mainline you can bet your last dollar this problem would have already been solved. People not from the OEM could then roll reliable ROMS and sell subscriptions to them. wat what's 5 years of security updates mean when the not-so-easily replaceable battery starts severely failing after 1 year? ask any nexus 6p owner. Midnitte If any OEM could povide that, I'd probably switch and pay whatever premium they'd need to persuade Qualcomm with Francisco Franco Good luck sustaining a business model where you don't render your old devices obsolete in some way. Like it or not, that's the world right now. Only Apple can pull this off because of the iPhone's "sex appeal" and social recognition, in which people will change phones every 12 months because the newer is always better and more shiny. And also they only support a couple devices and their approach to hardware-software symbiose, which makes it WAY easier to keep supporting older chipsets. I'm not defending either, just commenting on the issue. Rod People will feel compelled to replace their devices naturally, because of better tech, features or due to damage/theft. Thing is, the better the phones become, it will take more time. A current flagship is good for 3 years. marcusmarcus2 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a240cc67aa6bf180000a358f45011d5a5208fd745ddeb341eae6003c46c4c095.gif RenatoFontesTapia If this is compatible with custom roms new devices will last forever :') Nathan J It should be. Right now, your custom ROM includes a lot of if not all the drivers and whatnot, or open source implementations of them. Custom ROMs on the Motorola Photon/Electrify had open source implementations that were bad at best. CM7 was fine, but jump to ICS and you give up your camcorder. Camera is fine, but shoot videos and, nope. Go to JB and you lost Bluetooth. Go to 4.2 and you lost Wi-Fi as well. There was a great CM9 (ICS) build, and we just got a third party camcorder app that could film at VGA, I think. It wasn't a deal breaker then. So yeah, if I understand this correctly, the drivers will all sit on another partition, and ROMs won't be able to touch them. They'll just update the OS. So yes, tl;dr you're absolutely correct, a phone could get updates as long as CM/whatever or whomever wants to support them. Should make their jobs a lot easier, too. In fact, it might spur on a new renaissance of custom firmware development as the bar of skills to develop a custom ROM is basically lowered. YaKillaCJ This could mean a huge change for custom roms. Devs wouldnt have to rewrite, hack, reverse engineer, splice blobs and etc for every major update.Granted they could for better results/cutting edge results but they wouldnt have to Dmitry Stepanushkin "The vendor interface under Project Treble is also designed to be forwards-compatible, meaning that it shouldn't have to be updated for every Android update, in theory." Cmon, Google and huge army of OEMs will find a way to fuck it up and make You buy a new device every 1-2 major OS updates :). Duder12 Yes because Google makes money when you have to buy a new Samsung every year instead of using the same one. fijisiv Did you forget about the Pixel phones? dizel123 Did you forget about the Pixel phones minimal market share and contribution to Alphabet's profits? Tr3ple What? Source? Or Stop spewing bullshit AbdulB1 google device certification program is expensive. D13H4RD2L1V3 I wonder if it being the only device so far to support seamless updates also has something to do with it. Kurt Gomez They had already mentioned this... "In fact, the new Project Treble architecture is already running on the Developer Preview of O for Pixel phones." https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html?m=1 klaus666 The security updates that we get every month list patches for drivers very often. Just search for "Qualcomm" here as an example: https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2017-05-01 If Qualcomm decides to stop releasing new security patches for a given SoC then Treble won't solve this. Thomas Bohn I don't get this. Treble should be part of Android O. Otherwise it is pointless. It should be about to keep phones longer which already exist and not about producing more waste. zepy3 They're not going to support any Nexus phones anymore because they want that brand gone, it's all about Pixel now (which sucks). It's highly unlikely any other phone maker will rush to install this on any previous devices as well because that removes their ability to say "hey buy this phone and it lasts 4 years!". It also reduces the number of devices they'll sell this year because why upgrade when your current phone is good for several more years? So yeah, it's a good point about reducing waste now but the incentive is to reduce waste in the future rather than in the present. saf1927 Hopefully it is the case. Then again, I'd simply buy a new phone every year anyway. YaKillaCJ Hmm, this sounds good buy curious as to its implementation. Can anyone weigh in on how this will work? What Im hoping for is that Kernel/Drivers will be on a separate lower partition thats independent of Android OS itself. Android will use APIs to access everything. The added benefit being that your Android OS can be updated independently of the kernel, much how custom roms on older devices achieve it. This is very well used in linux currently. Old/backwards compatible kernels can boot the latest distro. Same with Windows and its drivers. Albeit that these has limits as some hardware eventual wont be compatible but so long as the basic hardware functions, it can boot and function but missing features. If this is the case, about fucking time! YaKillaCJ Its about fucking time! Fuck a carrier, fuck the OEM, fuck the manufacturers and anyone else who stand in the way of updates. Excuse the language but it had to be said for all use enthusiast. Carson Saldanha No, carriers and OEMs still stand in the way unfortunately. Only this time though, Google has removed the necessity of SoC manufacturer input for updates. AbdulB1 but what about custom roms? YaKillaCJ Well sort of, this gets rid 1 of the, if not the biggest reason for delay. Now OEMs don't have to built the Rom at the kernel, blobs, etc level each major update. This works great for any device not under carrier grip. This the Custom rom community will thrive. OEMs can update devices on MTK is another example. Stylish Frenchie Haha so now luck for s8. Will be updated to 7.1.1 in 2018 and will stuck at 7.1.2 in 2019 xD Nuno G. "One reason could be that the maker of your device's processor (e.g. Snapdragon or MediaTek) never updated the drivers for newer versions of Android." STOP with that stupid excuse!!! Google if they want could make himself device's processor drivers for their phones!!! Microsoft does this, for old hardware, and Windows 10 runs on very old machines... Mike I think you don't understand how drivers are developed. In theory Google could develop drivers but they would waste a ton of time and you'd probably see the same issues that AOSP ROMs face with either degraded performance or some features not working to full potential. Microsoft does not do this actually, sometimes they get lucky and old drivers work with the new OS (Basically how Treble is going to work) but if you remember anything about Vista you will know that they definitely don't make their own drivers. saf1927 Stop spreading bullshit. EvilHowl You don't understand what is a driver Aaron Don't think he knows what a HOLE is, either. :) matteventu AHAHAHAHAHA Aaron https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3843fb66143823d7d717610685198ccf6e75383730360b0afe6b4488d180f267.jpg Eric Walker I don't think you understand anything Qolam Reza Rezaei There is rumor about htc u11 getting 3 major updates if it sells well ! It looks they are talking about the same thing . But you are saying it is normally for devices that ship with o and pixel is a exception , are u sure ? jonzey231 I doubt it'll extend Pixel life. But maybe the'll announce 3-4 years of support for the 2nd gen pixels. matej On which chat did they reveal this? TechGuy22 haha nah they want you to buy pixel 3 XXXXXXXL ddevito "Possibly". That's horseshit. Sink or swim. Either come out and commit to something for a change or people will leave and go to the iPhone. And honestly Google doesn't give a shit, hell their iOS apps work great, if not better, on the iPhone anyway. The last thing they WANT to do is support hardware, the iPhone is perfect for them. They just need to support APPS, not hardware, not the Play Store and not the OS. It's no coincidence their iOS stuff just works better. They HAVE TO support their hardware because (I think) they felt all other OEMs were blowing it big time. dizel123 Android Police is who said "possibly", not Google. So are you really asking Android Police to commit to something on behalf of Google? Or are you just talking horseshit? JD They work way better on iOS JATIN BANSAL Do custom roms like LineageOS create their own drivers as they support some very old devices? If so, why can't google create their own for nexus devices? matteventu Same reason why you can't build your own car and drive on the street but you can drive it in your yard. Adam Margeson You can build your own car and drive it as long as it meets all required regulations - turn signals, mirrors, windshield wipers (yet surprisingly the windshield itself is not a requirement where I live), emission restrictions, etc. To answer OP's question, no, they don't create their own drivers. I think they write compatibility interfaces so that the old driver will continue to work. Either way, they do continue to use whatever proprietary binary blob the device initially came with. Unless someone with more information wants to chime in? matteventu You can write drivers for a Snap800 to run Nougat and use in your own custom ROM/kernel. You can't write drivers for a Snap800 to run Nougat and SELL a device that relies on them (neither update a commercial to them). This voids Qualcomm's agreement. Adam Margeson I don't think any of us are asking about the legal/contract aspect. We're just asking about the technical side - "How do they do it?" Either way, the drivers are still closed-source. matteventu Have you read the first comment of JATIN BANSAL? Adam Margeson Do custom roms like LineageOS create their own drivers as they support some very old devices? Yes. I have. AbdulB1 Vulkan is not supported by qualcomm for sd800/801 Nomaan Nexus 9 doesn't have vulkan support either. AbdulB1 You are right but Qualcomm made that excuse to cripple Android 7 update for SD800/801 based devices. JD They don't. They try to port other driver blobs, make do with the open source drivers that may exist. Failing all of them they use a 'shim' or a middleware. Eg new drivers may directly support the new OS API, but the old won't, so the middleware/shim will try to translate it but it may not work as a software expects or has indirect negative impact eg poor battery life. Stadi "Normally, only phones that ship with Android O will work with Treble" Where does this information come from? And what's the cause of this limitation? So why can't something like an S8 have this once upgraded to O? lomsha Because Google Officer sweetchuck Now if they can just make venders make their interface an option. create812 Whether I decided to keep or sale my Pixel, it'll carry more value forward for me! rmkilc Will this put us to the point where an OS install binary or update binary will be universal or will they still be device dependent? needa It would surprise me if Google did extend it. They knew of this when they announced the two years. Why not say three years, or four years of updates? Not to mention the Pixel is their first dive into their own hardware. I fully expect them to abandon it as soon as they can. Nature of the beast. Rod How do you know they knew about this? needa They cant just think of it a week ago and say hey, this will be on Android O and will also work with the Pixel. ie, this has been in development for longer than a week. Rod Yeah, but Pixel's development started early 2016. Maybe they were devloped at the same time, but they weren't sure it would work and chose not to count on it. needa That very well might b the case. Had that thought run through my mind before I posted. And again when I saw your first. lol But it is the internet... have to stand my ground and cannot be wrong. Rod I forgive you Nomaan If treble isnt part of O builds for nexus 5x, 6p then sure there must be a reason they included it in Pixel. wade_county This is great for people who keep their phones for longer than 2 years. I've already come to grips to the OS update situation and just buy a new phone every year. I stopped caring about if my phone is going to get the next version of Android because the next phone I'll buy will have that new version of Android anyway. If anything, I care more about security updates than the next version. abc Extended support? For a Google device? lol. Good one. Be grateful if Google even makes Pixel devices three years from now. xtess3ractx What I don't understand is, why can't they just use the old drivers if they aren't updated?

As you probably know, there's an Apps sub-section in the Settings app with a list of all installed applications.

(Nicoleta Ionescu/Shutterstock) Renee Filippone Senior Business Reporter Renee is the senior business reporter with CBC News based in Toronto. She has spent a decade with the organization in a number of roles, including weekend news anchor, television and radio reporter, associate producer, program director and others.

The first page of results turns up articles about people scammed out of thousands of dollars after responding to fake job postings. Now, a Toronto mystery shopper recruiter says the people behind those scams are hurting her business by making potential recruits skeptical. Some even had the audacity to pose as her online. 'If I waited for there not to be a Facebook scam, I would never recruit,' mystery shopper recruiter Julie Anthony says. (Julie Anthony) "A lot of the time they will target legit company names and right now there is a scam under my company name," said Julie Anthony, CEO of Shoppers Confidential. When she reaches out to potential recruits, it often takes time to convince them she is legitimate. She has even had people call her to complain they had been fooled by a scam under her own name. Anthony said people are dismissing and avoiding her posts on social media. But using social platforms has become the only way to reach potential recruits in remote locations. "If I waited for there not to be a Facebook scam," she said, "I would never recruit."  'Mystery shopper' job scam defrauds Brantford woman of $6K Mystery shopper scammed $2K, man admits to fraud on phone Bank reconsiders, reaches deal with mystery shopper scam victim Her company has recruited tens of thousands of Canadians to be secret shoppers. They go undercover to check out service and cleanliness at places like fast-food restaurants or even five-star hotels. The recruits are paid to report back to the company on their experience. Most mystery shopping scams involve victims wiring money back to the person behind the scam. (Shoppers Confidential) This type of employment has become a major target for scam artists posing as legitimate recruiting firms and targeting victims on social media. Statistics collected by the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre show 204 job scams in just the first two months of 2017, with a cost to victims of $500,000. How it works The scam is common but fairly complicated. Someone poses as a legitimate business looking for recruits on social media or via text message. When they find a potential victim, that person is sent a cheque, told to cash it, keep a portion of the money for themselves, spend some at the business retail outlet they are being asked to evaluate and return the rest to the scammer. A few days later, the victim finds out the original cheques were fraudulent and they are on the hook for the money they just returned.    Falling victim to the scam "They do this for everybody though, it's not just me and it's not the first time," said Anthony. "I have people calling me saying, 'Is this Julie?' And they start talking about a cheque, and I am like 'I didn't send you a cheque. Oh no, what did you do? ' " Anthony said her office employees are often accused of being scammers online and that's why they created a video to explain how their business actually works. "I just want a megaphone and scream to the world: 'Cheques don't come for free in the mail,' " she told CBC News in an interview. The animated video points out that the typical pay for a mystery shopper is between $20 and $50, not the thousands promised by scammers. It also points to some red flags, like being paid before work is done or being asked to wire transfer money. "It's not surprising to me at all," says Evan Kelly, senior communications adviser with the Better Business Bureau of Mainland B.C. Employment scams were the No. 1 scam last year in the agency's list of the top 10 scams. "The mystery shopper and stay-at-home administrative assistant are the two fake jobs scams that are out there and typically they are cheque-cashing schemes," says Kelly. Victims are often out thousands of dollars, he says, and there is good reason for people to be skeptical, but he admits that can create challenges for companies doing legitimate business. "It becomes a communication issue. How does the business rise above that and that's the big hurdle they got."

I've always avoided using search in settings as I really hate permanent search history. Semi-related (Settings related, at least), it's nice that when you flip the Developer Options toggle off, it'll actually remove itself from the settings menu now. Diego S. Finally!!!!

Technology titans such as Schmidt, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, and Talk Talk’s Sir Charles Dunstone are the Rockefellers and JP Morgans in the modern America’s Cup era. But Wendy Schmidt is no dabbling socialite. Tonight’s "Eat Lionfish Throwdown" party is a cook-off in which chefs from each of the six competing national teams will prepare dishes made from lionfish. But this isn’t just an excuse to demonstrate cookery prowess; the real aim is to stimulate culinary demand for an invasive species that’s destroying Bermuda’s reefs.  And it doesn’t stop there with Schmidt. It never does. The family foundation created 11th Hour Racing to promote sustainable thinking around marine conservancy through sailboat racing. It’s a good example of the kind of joined-up thinking that’s emblematic of 21st-century technology companies. There is a camaraderie in a team on a sailboat that for me is a model for management of people in generalWendy Schmidt At the Throwdown, Schmidt will present the Guardian LF1, a US-designed fishing robot designed to catch lionfish at the extreme depth – 1,300ft – at which they hunt. It was used to catch some of the 200 lionfish consumed at the event.  "When the America’s Cup World Series took place here in 2015, we were invited to a friend’s house – he’s part of the Bermuda Underwater Exploration Museum," explains Schmidt, who has in the past decade learnt to dive as well as sail. "There were some conservation folks there and also a friend of theirs, Colin Angle, from  US robotics pioneers iRobot.  "We all sat around complaining about the lionfish. Some of the best spear-fisher guys were there as well. The conversation went something like, 'What can you do?' 'Well, maybe a robot…' 'Maybe we could help you with that robot…' 'Maybe we could help you fund development of that robot…' So one thing led to another." And that’s pretty much how it is with the 150-plus projects funded or part-funded by the philanthropy of the Schmidt Family Foundation. Wendy herself is cool, elegant, polished but  not veneered – and approachable. Passionate certainly, but pragmatic more so. It’s hard not to like her. "I try to think about how to redefine philanthropy," she says. "Broadly speaking, it is a tool to empower people. I believe – and my husband does too, as we’ve lived through it – that our world  is seeing an enormous revolution of technology and systemic thinking. I’d characterise us as proactive. We’re trying to do things differently from conventional philanthropy. We move more quickly; we throw a wider net."  11th Hour Racing is part of The 11th Hour Project, which concentrates its work around energy and renewables. Its logo was the first to appear alongside Sir Ben Ainslie’s BAR team logo when he launched his campaign to win the Cup.  Schmidt and Ainslie first met in San Francisco during the nail-biting 2013 event, when her role was to raise public money for the event to help fund the policing and the sanitation. "We promoted a scheme to rid San Francisco of plastic bottles during that event," she adds. (The city has since banned the sale of plastic bottles in public spaces.) The pair met again the following year, and now 11th Hour’s sustainability criteria shape everything Ainslie’s team does. But he’s not Schmidt’s first titled British sailing legend. In 2012 she launched the Schmidt MacArthur Fellowship Programme with Dame Ellen MacArthur, to help support MacArthur’s own foundation.  For someone so clearly comfortable around sailors, Schmidt was a late convert, growing up away from the coast in New Jersey. "We drove to the beach to get sunburned and sandy once a summer, and that was about it," she recalls. Schmidt graduated from Smith College – celebrated for alumni such as Gloria Steinem and Sylvia Plath. She then studied journalism and met Eric – "I edited his PhD thesis for him."  They bought their first boat together in 2007 from a friend in St Barts, and were soon hooked. It was inevitable sailing would become the channel for 11th Hour’s work and a metaphor for its method.  "Sailors I know from all levels have  an understanding of the power of the forces they are invoking," she says. "I call it a conversation with the wind. Sometimes it’s a nice one, and sometimes it’s very scary. "There is a camaraderie in a team on  a sailboat that for me is a model for management of people in general, because you’re really all trying to do the same thing and if anyone in your team is not doing a good job, for whatever reason, then everyone suffers."  Indeed. Since the election of Donald Trump last November, environmentalists worldwide have been on red alert, and although Schmidt concedes that there are now "headwinds", she has no plans to panic and return to port just yet. "I come from a place that’s optimistic," she says. "I come from a body of people inside the Foundation who see the world through that lens, and you’ve just got to take the knocks sometimes. I don’t believe anyone in the United States, whether they voted for the president or not, wants their water dirtier than it is now. I don’t think people want a world that is described  by turning the clock back 50 years."  America may be bearing away from environmental leadership but, with people like Wendy Schmidt at the helm, the increasingly tech-driven America’s Cup certainly isn’t.  11thhourproject.org Share this article Follow The Telegraph Follow on Twitter Follow on Facebook Follow on Instagram View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Editor's choice Gallery 20 May 2017, 9:40pm Gallery: Kendall Jenner, Pamela Anderson and Lottie Moss sparkle on the red carpet: the best jewellery at the Cannes Film Festival 2017 Gallery 20 May 2017, 8:00am Gallery: 50 summer-holiday essentials 18 May 2017, 9:00am Who are London's super-rich property buyers?

YOU do! And it’s all thanks to the internet. Brands are tracking online searches and social media trends to find out what we really want beauty-wise – then creating it for us… Celebrities are, of course. also major influencers, while the industry is also keen to tap into the Far East market for charcoal products. And seeing as we're all become obsessed with fitness, there's no wonder there's now a call for make-up you can wear while exercising and mindfulness-inspired beauty. Find out more... Nails Nails is an area where brands can react quickly to trending looks. Caroline Dawe at Barry M says, "Our new Molten Metals Nail Paint in Holographic Lights, £3.99, stemmed from the chrome manicure trend Kylie Jenner blew up last year on social media. We saw chrome and holographic nails trending on Instagram, so we went to our labs to create our own formula." The internet also helps brands react to practical beauty issues. Jeremy Lowenstein at Sally Hansen says, "By listening to social media, we found women feel their nails need a break, especially those who overuse gels, but they also don’t want to sacrifice colour. It’s been the driving force behind our new colour that cares while you wear Color Therapy polishes." £6.99 each in 38 nail-strengthening, argan oil-infused shades. Hair Hair launches are often influenced by Google search trends, says Dr Evans, innovation director at PZ Cussons. "We saw over 5 million hits on daily hair washing, for instance. Women are worried it’s bad for their hair, but also feel they have to shampoo daily as they’re exercising or living in polluted cities. Those search trends have led to Charles Worthington Everyday Gentle shampoo, £5.99, which uses a gentler technology, so women can wash daily without worrying they’re damaging their hair." Brands tap into lists like The Pinterest 100, which pinpoints trends with the highest search growth, such as #NoHeatHair. "In June, Redken is launching No Blow-Dry Creams, £17.50, (added to damp, just-washed hair to help it air-dry prettily) to cater for the demand driven by the #NoHeatHair trend on social channels," says Steve Shiel, L’Oréal Group Scientific Developer. Make-up Seen a make-up look you want to recreate at home? There’s an online tutorial for that. Not surprisingly, brands are keeping a close eye on which how-to searches are growing fastest and providing ways to perfect women’s most-wanted looks. "We’ve seen a consistent rise in Google searches for full defined eyebrows and how to fill in gaps in brows," says Kathryn Hill at Rimmel. "We’ve answered that with Brow This Way Fibre Pencil, £4.99, the UK’s first pencil with nylon fibres to boost volume and colour." Benefit, meanwhile, has taken note of ‘How To Do A Smokey Eye’ appearing consistently on Google’s 10 most-asked beauty questions and made it easier with They’re Real Duo Shadow Blender, £19.50. This cleverly lets women apply the base and the smokey contour shade in a single sweep. And don’t underestimate the power of make-up reviews you post online either. For instance, Smashbox doubled the size of the neutral shades when creating its Cover Shot eye palettes, £24, in response to online comments saying these were the colours that ran out first. Lifestyle trends are also feeding into make-up, with 1.5m #gymselfie hashtags on Instagram influencing new sweat-proof cosmetics, such as Sport FX, Tarte Athleisurewear (out June) and Primark’s Workout Beauty. Skin The natural trend shows no sign of slowing. "Searches for skin care are rising 31% year on year, and over half are natural-ingredient based," says Karen Flavard-Jones at Garnier. "Women are so conscious about what they’re putting on their skin now." That’s led to Garnier 96% Natural Origin range, from £3.49, which is free from ‘nasties’ and lists ingredients and their sources on the label. (Like, did you know that ‘caprylic triglyceride’ is from coconut?) Brands are also clamouring to meet our obsession with Asian beauty, with Pinterest revealing Korean-inspired charcoal as its fastest-growing skincare search. L’Oréal Paris has just expanded its Pure Clay range with a Charcoal Detox Foam Wash, £5.99, while Sanctuary, Zero Skin, Filorga, Erborian and Masque Bar have launched charcoal skincare in the past two months alone. On Clean Beauty Clean lifestyle trends have been THE boom area online, and beauty brands are tapping into our thirst for wellness too. Cult Beauty has started stocking ‘farm to face’ range Farmacy (using organic ingredients grown on the brand’s own farm), while Neom, Elemis and Elemental Herbology have new mindfulness ranges, which match you to the right mood-elevating remedy or scent. Vegan beauty arrivals for this year alone include Dr Hauschka make-up, W3LL PEOPLE at Cult Beauty, Spectrum’s vegan brushes, Pacifica’s vegan fragrances, Dr’s Remedy vegan polishes… Phew, who knew you were so influential?

Source: Supplied The job, if you're up for it, comes with bleak warnings of ongoing exposure to child pornography, animal cruelty, beheadings, violent deaths and ubiquitous dick pics. Uniquely gruelling, the role of social media moderator is not for everyone. Tucked away and hidden far from the shiny sprawling campuses of the tech giants in Silicon Valley, there is relatively little known about the business of social media moderation. What is certain is that it is a rapidly growing industry. Imagery and videos the moderators handled was "designed to entertain the most twisted and sick minded people in the world", according to a 2017 lawsuit filed against Microsoft by two of its moderators. Source: Supplied The mission of the few companies operating in this sphere is to scrub the world's biggest social media sites and mobile apps of all the things Mark Zuckerberg and his tech billionaire pals don't want you to see on your morning commute. An army of employees, mostly located in India and Philippines work fastidiously 24/7 to put the stoppers on illicit, illegal and disturbing content. It is a secretive business of non-disclosure agreements and tightly controlled information over who is working for who. An estimated 150,000 people work as social media moderators - more than double Google's head count and dwarfing the ranks of Facebook almost nine times over. Ciaran Cassidy, an Irish filmmaker, wanted to know what that world looked like. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at Facebook's F8 Developer Conference during April, 2017. Source: AFP He was motivated to investigate after reading a 2014 expose in Wired. Inside that story, written by an undercover journalist, two moderators working in the Philippines are flippantly discussing beheading videos. It jarred, the way ISIL's shocking terror propaganda had become banal for hardworking, lowly paid people who are exposed to the worst the internet can throw up. Wanting in was one thing, getting in was another. Cassidy told nine.com.au his requests to the big multi-national operators located in Bangalore - companies like Infosys, Oracle – were either knocked back or flat out ignored. He kept trying and eventually got access. Foiwe Info Global Solutions, a smaller player, but one of the first companies to set up in the moderation market, invited Cassidy to their Bangalore base. "There are people in India, Indonesia, the Philippines who sit in a warehouse who have to sift through this very stressing material to make sure that we don't," Ciaran Cassidy, documentary maker, told nine.com.au. Source: Supplied A trainer at Foiwe explains to a room of new recruits what they can expect to see in their role of social media moderators. Source: Supplied On that first morning, Cassidy and Field of Vision co-director Adrian Chen, plonked themselves down near an empty desk in the company's training room. The computer monitor spewed up a stream of flagged content. "A lot of graphic material was popping up on the computer and I felt quite awkward sitting there," Cassidy told nine.com.au. "You could see some of the stuff that might be coming across their screens, like child abuse and porn. And you're wondering how that would affect you." It causes an extreme psychological impact, according to two US-based internet moderators who filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, their employer, in January of this this year. The pair said having to watch child abuse, bestiality and "inhumane and disgusting content" over and over caused Post-Traumatic Stress disorder. The imagery and videos the moderators were confronted with were "designed to entertain the most twisted and sick minded people in the world", the complaint outlined. Microsoft, the two workers said, had not adequately warned them about what the job entailed. The Seattle-based firm rejected the claims their "wellness program" designed to support its moderators was insufficient. Facebook's roughly 1.7 billion users upload around 350 million images every day, and a deluge of 85 million new photographs and videos hits Instagram daily. Source: Supplied. Facebook's roughly 1.7 billion users upload around 350 million images every day, and a deluge of 85 million new photographs and videos hits Instagram daily. Zuckerberg and the tech elite are sitting on multi-billion-dollar goldmines and they don't want the user experience or public perception derailed by illicit content. "Most giant internet tech companies have these images, and their brand is bright and optimistic," Cassidy said. "Their employees sit on beanbags and they bring people together. The existence of content moderation is the dark side of that, and I think it's one that maybe they wouldn't be that welcome about a light being shone on. "There are people in India, Indonesia, the Philippines who sit in a warehouse who have to sift through this very stressing material to make sure that we don't." Going completely against the flow of its competitors, Foiwe allowed Cassidy and Chen to put their cameras wherever they wanted, and speak to any employees they liked. Cassidy found Foiwe's transparency was refreshing, and at the same time disturbing. "They didn't try and control us," Cassidy said. "I wondered what was going on in these bigger, shadier places. What's going on at all the places that wouldn't speak to us or allow us in? There may be a lot more disturbing material that people have to view." Clocks dialed into world's different time zones hang on the wall at Foiwe. The Bangalore company has clients in the Americas, Russia, Europe, Asia and India. Source: Supplied Young, well-educated and smart, Bangalore-native Suman Howlader, the chief executive who founded Foiwe in 2010, was one of the pioneers in India's social moderation industry. He told nine.com.au how Fortune 500 IT companies (Oracle, Infosys, Congizant) had recently set up huge social content moderation divisions in Bangalore. Howlader would not tell nine.com.au who his specific US and European clients were, but he did reveal the sectors: social media, matchmaking and dating, e-commerce and media companies. Most of Howlader's employees are Hindus; Arranged marriages are still commonplace in India, and even dating outside of marriage can be a delicate cultural matter at many family dinner tables, he said. Anyone wanting to work at Foiwe must spend one week being slowly introduced to the worst of the West's internet behaviours. They will then spend six weeks training to become a social media moderator. Foiwe's moderators typically assess around 120 images per hour. Foiwe's content moderators will typically assess around 120 images per hour. Source: Supplied "We do not force the moderators to look at each and everything. It is up to the comfort level of each moderator," Howlader said. Regular counselling, especially during the six-week training program, is essential to retaining workers, according to Howlader. He admits the attrition rate can be high. "We tend to hire computer science engineers who at a certain point at time will have spent a lot of time on the internet, to already be exposed to this kind of content online. That is the key," he said. Watching a fatal Russian car accident on YouTube can significantly distress some people for as long as a month afterwards, Lauren Monds, a psychology researcher at Sydney University, told nine.com.au. A lack of proper support for content moderators to mentally and emotionally decompress can lead to PTSD, depression, substance abuse, she added. Tourists outside the Google office in Mountain View, California. Source: AFP Monds explained that, without a coherent narrative, such as in the role of content moderation, the impact of being exposed to haunting and shocking imagery is amplified. If someone watches a dog being beaten with a stick but doesn't later get to see that animal being rescued by people then the experience and lasting effect is markedly different, Monds said. "It's quite an extraordinary existence," documentary maker Cassidy said after observing the moderators in action over the course of one week. "What I find shocking almost in a weird way is it is a very normal office environment. They're all regular people that everybody can identify with. They have the same kind of jokes in the canteen. "It could have been an office environment that wouldn't have looked out of place in Dublin or Melbourne or anywhere in the world."

Josh Miller/CNET Drones by Joshua Goldman May 20, 2017 7:00 AM PDT @ByJoshG Over the past couple years there's been a steady stream of stories about unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), aka drones, being used for deliveries. There was the Domino's Pizza delivery in New Zealand, the 77 7-Eleven drops to customers in Reno, Nevada, and Google parent company Alphabet's Chipotle burrito shipments to Virginia Tech students, to name a few. Click for more stories. Aaron Robinson/CNET Though these deliveries were basically public tests used to gather data -- and attract attention -- for the companies behind them, I can't help but think using such amazing machines for personal deliveries is a little ridiculous. Along with that, there are so many hurdles -- from airspace congestion and regulations, to payload weight and flight-time limitations, to weather conditions -- that it's just not efficient or economical when, in general, a single car, van or truck can accomplish much more. For example, Amazon's Prime Air service, currently in beta testing in the UK, is limited to customers within several miles of a shipping facility for packages weighing less than five pounds (2.3 kg). Not only does this limit what can be delivered and to whom, it's not even possible in the US with current FAA restrictions, which includes keeping the drone in line of sight while flying -- defeating the purpose of aerial delivery. OK, so delivering pizza isn't the thing that makes drones really valuable and cool, but here's what is: quickly delivering emergency food, medicine and supplies in disaster zones, to rural and remote areas, up mountains or out in the ocean. Delivery drones that can get where trucks and pricey helicopters can't will become indispensable. They're not only going to save time and money, they'll save lives. Safety first UPS partners for drone deliveries in Rwanda Drones delivering vital medical supplies to Rwanda will take to the skies in July 2016. UPS has partnered with drone company Zipline to deliver blood and vaccines. by Lexy Savvides 2:32 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Though not as attention-grabbing as burritos for college students, UPS and drone maker CyPhy Works staged a delivery from Beverly, Massachusetts to an island three miles off the Atlantic coast to deliver an inhaler to a child on the island. Likewise, delivery service Flirtey, the company behind the 7-Eleven deliveries, has also demonstrated how its drones can be used for ship-to-shore deliveries of life-saving aid to coastal regions. Land Rover's Project Hero combines a roof-mounted drone for disaster response with a new 2017 Discovery SUV and is currently being used by the Austrian Red Cross. Then there's Zipline, which is already making medical deliveries by drone to hospitals across Rwanda. Along with saving lives, commercial delivery drones are going to be able to keep things like utilities and manufacturing plants up and and running when systems need to be repaired or parts replaced. Instead of waiting days for a part to arrive, a delivery drone can be given a flight plan and sent on its way, all on its own. There are companies working on the commercial drone hurdles I mentioned earlier, too. On May 5, a Nevada UAV consortium set a record flying a fixed-wing drone nearly 100 miles for a package delivery using cellular connectivity. Similarly, Qualcomm has been running trials using 4G LTE networks to safely guide UAVs beyond visual line of sight and below 400 feet. What this will eventually mean is that deliveries will be more accurate and safer via a constant commercial mobile network connection between the operator and the drone, and those deliveries can happen at greater distances. And, NASA just announced new technology it developed for autonomous crash management to potentially help delivery drones land safely in highly populated areas should something go wrong. In the end, the technologies used in delivery drones are going to be the same regardless of their cargo. I guess I'm just hoping the next time you see a story about a drone delivering sunscreen, you sit back and think about how that same flying robot is capable of delivering so much more.

However once the update is downloading, there’s really nothing you do about it which can sometimes prove to be inconvenient. However in a report from Android Police, Google is making some changes to that and will actually allow users to pause system updates in the future. While it was initially thought to be an Android O feature, Google engineer Elliott Hughes posted on Google+ suggested that it is part of a change in the Play Store that was being tested internally before anyone really noticed, but presumably it should roll out on a wider basis with Android O. Hughes also clarifies that this feature won’t just be limited to huge system updates, but small files as well. However he states that this might not be so apparent since smaller files tend to download quicker, meaning that users probably won’t notice until it’s already been downloaded in which there would be no more point in pausing it. Either way it does sound like an immensely useful feature so if you do want the feature then keep an eye out for its availability in the near future. Filed in Cellphones.

Rematch of man vs machine in ancient game Dan Martin, Agence France-Presse Posted at May 21 2017 12:40 PM Share Save Facebook Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo will face the world's top-ranked Go player, China's 19-year-old Ke Jie, in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI . Ed Jones, AFP SHANGHAI - It's man vs machine this week as Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo faces the world's top-ranked Go player in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI. China's 19-year-old Ke Jie is given little chance in the three-game series beginning Tuesday in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen after AlphaGo stunned observers last year by trouncing South Korean grand master Lee Se-Dol four games to one. Lee's loss in Seoul marked the first time a computer program had beaten a top player in a full match in the 3,000-year-old Chinese board game, and has been hailed as a landmark event in the development of AI. AI has previously beaten humans in cerebral contests, starting with IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess grand master Garry Kasparov in 1997, but AlphaGo's win last year is considered the most significant win for AI yet. Go is considered perhaps the most complex game ever devised, with an incomputable number of move options that puts a premium on "intuition." Proponents had considered it a bastion in which human thought would remain superior, at least for the foreseeable future. AlphaGo's triumph fueled hopes of a brave new world in which AI is applied not only to driver-less cars or "smart homes", but to helping mankind figure out some of the most complex scientific, technical, and medical problems. "AlphaGo's successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered," Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, said ahead of this week's matches. AI's ultimate goal is to create "general" or multi-purpose, rather than "narrow," task-specific intelligence -- something resembling human reasoning and the ability to learn. SCI-FI NIGHTMARE  But for some, it conjures sci-fi images of a future in which machines "wake up" and enslave humanity. Physicist Stephen Hawking is a leading voice for caution, warning in 2015 that computers may outsmart humans, "potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand." Ke faces AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Ke is a brash prodigy who went pro at 11 years old, has been world number one for more than two years, and has described himself as a "pretentious prick". After AlphaGo flattened Lee, Ke declared he would never lose to the machine. "Bring it on," he said on China's Twitter-like Weibo. But he has tempered his bravado since then. Ke was among many top Chinese players who were trounced in online contests in January by a mysterious adversary who reportedly won 60 straight victories. That opponent -- cheekily calling itself "The Master" -- was later revealed by DeepMind to have been an updated AlphaGo. "Even that was not AlphaGo's best performance," Gu Li, a past national champion, told Chinese state media last week. "It would be very hard for Ke to play against it, but then again, Ke has also been working extremely hard to change his methods in preparation. I hope he can play well." Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid. The winner is the player who seals off the most territory. AlphaGo uses two sets of "deep neural networks" containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught -- having played millions of games against itself after initial programming.  Share Save Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Read More:  Google   AlphaGo   DeepMind   artificial intelligence   technology   /business/12/16/16/artificial-intelligence-creeps-into-daily-life /business/05/16/17/artificial-intelligence-to-give-humans-superpowers-says-ai-innovator /video/life/03/03/17/artificial-intelligence-in-ph-threat-or-tool LATEST NEWS MOST READ Sagittarius Mines denies links with finance chief May 22, 2017 Cayetano seeks faster passport processing May 22, 2017 'Anti-Distracted Driving Act' author wants to suspend law's implementation May 22, 2017 Cathay Pacific sacks 600 staff in major shakeup May 22, 2017 Jollibee apologizes for 'Versace on the Floor' viral video May 22, 2017 Mahindra takes a page from Celtics playbook, follows 'ubuntu' philosophy May 22, 2017 Teresa, naniniwalang mahal ni Cesar ang anak nilang si Diego May 22, 2017 Philippine minister starts damage control after Duterte's China war remark May 22, 2017 6 from University of Mindanao-Davao in top 10 of high school teachers' exam May 22, 2017 PANOORIN: Donita, moving on na sa hiwalayan nila ng asawa May 22, 2017 Duterte heads to Russia in blow to US May 22, 2017 Sanggol na tinangay ng kasambahay, nasagip sa N.

Rider sharing companies, such as Uber and Lyft have launched rental, leases and financing deals to have more drivers, but critics say drivers are paying high and even predatory prices. (AP Photo/Tae-Gyun Kim) Uber drivers have been complaining that the gap between the fare a rider pays and what the driver receives is getting wider. After months of unsatisfying answers, Uber Technologies is providing an explanation: It’s charging some passengers more because it needs the extra cash. The change stems from a feature introduced last year called upfront pricing. By guaranteeing a certain fare before customers book, Uber said, it provides more transparency. But it continued paying drivers using the old model, a combination of mileage, time and multipliers based on geographic demand. The difference between those two calculations could be the future of Uber’s business. Daniel Graf, Uber’s head of product, said upfront pricing couldn’t be summed up in a simple formula. Uber applies machine-learning techniques to estimate how much groups of customers are willing to shell out for a ride, calculating riders’ propensity for paying a higher price for a particular route at a certain time of day, he said. For instance, someone traveling from a wealthy neighborhood to another tony spot might be asked to pay more than another person heading to a poorer part of town, even if demand, traffic and distance are the same. Uber calls this “route-based pricing.” Uber began on Friday communicating the changes to drivers. It will start reporting the price a passenger pays on each ride, though it will stop breaking out its percentage of the fare. It will also send an updated terms of service agreement reflecting the new fee system to drivers. Route-based pricing is now limited to 14 cities where Uber offers its carpooling service. Graf said Uber’s pricing techniques had grown incredibly sophisticated. He oversees a team called marketplace at headquarters in San Francisco that’s staffed with economists and statisticians. Graf, a former Google and Twitter executive, sees financial engineering as a competitive advantage, one way that Uber can stay ahead of Lyft and other ride-hailing operators. “Google search is very simple to do; it’s very complex what’s happening behind the scenes,” Graf said. “The same thing here. Taking a trip is easy. To make this all work in a whole market, and sustainable, is really, really hard.” In the process, pricing became something of a black box for passengers and another source of tension with drivers. Drivers accused Uber of cutting them out of income they were entitled to and misleading them about its plans. During the last year, Uber had attributed price discrepancies to the uncertainty around estimating fares, even as it was experimenting with techniques designed to exploit the imbalance between what customers were willing to pay and what drivers would take. The Rideshare Guy, a popular blog among drivers, conducted a study in New York City published in May, finding widespread disparities between rider fares and driver pay. Workers weren’t happy. “It is immoral and unethical behavior,” said Chris Estrada, who drives for Uber in Riverside, Calif. Uber has faced a torrent of scandals this year, including a trade secrets lawsuit, sexual harassment allegations, a brief boycott over its ties to the administration of President Donald Trump and a video showing the chief executive officer arguing with a driver over falling fares. Two of the longest-running criticisms of the seven-year-old company are ones that are sometimes at odds: It loses too much money, and it pays drivers too little. The company told Bloomberg in April that it lost $2.8 billion in 2016, excluding its China business. In the case of upfront pricing, Uber may move closer to resolving investors’ concerns about losses but could alienate drivers along the way. “You know our numbers,” Graf said. “We do want to run and operate a sustainable business.” Uber said it wasn’t hoarding the additional revenue generated from route-based pricing but was reinvesting much of it into increasing the number of trips, subsidizing UberPool usage and paying bonuses to drivers. Christian Perea, who writes for the Rideshare Guy, said drivers would appreciate the added transparency about how much passengers are paying. “That is a big deal,” he said.

Microsoft is an investor in Uber. “It’s a very dangerous moment for them, but there are good economic reasons to do it.” Uber is a company filled with over-optimizers who will continue to tinker with prices in hopes of finding equilibrium. “If things are not balanced, we create levers to motivate people to make it balanced again,” Graf said. “There’s choices, right? Always. There’s never, ‘I have to use Uber.’” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business. Get twice-daily updates on what the St. Louis business community is talking about.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Follow these tips to widen your organic reach on Facebook This article was originally published on PR Daily in May 2016. If you want to make your head spin, Google „Facebook organic reach is dead.” It’s a one-way ticket to a world of irreconcilable opinions. „Abandon ship; organic reach is dead!” versus, „No, wait; Facebook is still a land of opportunity!” It’s more than a little difficult trying to figure out who’s right—especially because in a lot of ways, everyone is right (and everyone is wrong, too). Though there’s no arguing that Facebook has offered diminishing returns for businesses and marketers over the years, that’s a symptom of growth with any relatively young, increasingly competitive medium. That’s why I made the conscious decision to stop paying attention to both sides of the organic reach argument. Instead of allowing myself to be passive and feel helpless in the face of declining reach, I learned how to adapt to Facebook’s changes before they happen—and to refocus my strategy on statistics that affect my bottom line a lot more than reach ever did. Here’s how I shifted focus, and where you can start: Stay up to date on algorithm changes Facebook uses complex algorithms to determine how much organic reach to give your updates. If you pay attention, every now and then they’ll give you an inside peek at what they’re looking for. Facebook’s newsroom periodically shares news about upcoming algorithm changes, so savvy marketers can start adjusting their social media strategies ahead of time. Share the right kind of content, and Facebook might reward you with better reach. Post the wrong kind of content, and that reach could tank. For example, in autumn 2014, Facebook announced that it was going to start favoring link posts with images attached over photo posts with URLs in their captions. As of February 2015, link posts were getting as much as three times the organic reach of photo posts—and because I had adjusted my strategy months prior, I’d been reaping the benefits for a long time. If I hadn’t known, I might have been wasting my time and energy on posting the wrong types of content, as a lot of organizations were doing. Keep an eye out for Facebook’s announcements regarding algorithm changes, and you can stay ahead of the curve. RELATED: Join us at Facebook HQ for the Social Media and Storytelling Summit.] Watch your own data When are some of the best times to post on Facebook? Around noon? Just after dinner time? Weekdays, weekends? Actually, the best times to post on Facebook depend entirely on you and your audience; that’s not an answer you’ll find in a blog post. Instead of scouring the Web for tips about hot times to post, stay on your own Facebook page; that’s where all the answers are. Your page’s Insights tab will provide a wealth of information about your users, including the days and times when they’re online. You can also sort your posts according to which ones got the most engagement and which had the highest reach, so you can determine not just when you should post, but what you should post. I’ve found that these statistics exhibit some ebb and flow as my audience and its habits change over time, so I monitor them periodically and use my findings to continually refine and refocus my posting habits. Variables such as my ideal posting times and my most popular content aren’t always consistent, but by checking my statistics regularly, I can eliminate a considerable amount of guesswork and have an easier time posting when it counts the most. Ignore misleading statistics Statistic taken out of context can be dangerous, so think twice before listening to the wisdom of the crowd. Case in point: Most consumers say brand managers should post to Facebook just once or twice per day. Should you take their advice? Absolutely not. Consider that the average organic reach on Facebook is about 7 percent—a statistic that most consumers probably aren’t aware of. If you post only twice a day, you might be reaching about one-seventh of your followers at best. Facebook’s algorithms mean that most of your fans won’t see any given update you share. Depending on the types of updates you post, you could share 10 in a day and still reach only about half your fans. So although they might want to see only one or two posts from you in a single day, you would have to post significantly more frequently than once or twice to hit that mark. The solution I’ve implemented has been to save my social media updates and re-share them over time. This makes it easier to maintain a heavy posting schedule (posting as many as 20 updates per day, across different social media networks), and it ensures that every update gets multiple chances to find its audience. Why throw away a perfectly good Facebook update when 93 percent of your audience didn’t even see it? Keep these points in mind, and not only will you worry less about whether organic reach on Facebook is „dead,” but you’ll also watch your own organic reach improve over time.

With traditional sources of circulation and advertising revenues drying up, the world's biggest news brands are spreading their wings to grow digital audiences. One of the first places they have set up, producing local content for the domestic market, is Australia -- already home to some of their largest foreign audiences, and with a ready population of early technology adopters and keen news consumers. But with the market near-saturated, analysts say the foreign outlets, with their deep pockets and mostly free content, are eating into struggling local media's revenues. This has helped accelerate job cuts and belt-tightening at some of the country's main publishers -- Fairfax (Sydney Morning Herald, The Age) and News Corp Australia (The Australian, Sydney Daily Telegraph). The foreign publishers "don't require a subscription, don't have a paywall and the problem is that's weakening and disrupting all the existing players", media analyst Steve Allen of Fusion Strategy told AFP, dubbing them "foreign invaders". "So it's a nasty convergence of new entrants taking eyeballs away from the traditional mastheads and eroding their revenue base." - 'Rivers of gold' drying up - Advertising revenues are already under siege from Google and Facebook, with Morgan Stanley estimating last year they would suck up 35-40 percent of the total pool of Aus$13.9 billion (US$10.3 billion) in Australia. "The size of the (ad spend) cake is staying the same and growing by inflation at best. So for a new entrant to come in and take money, they take it off an existing player," media analyst Peter Cox told AFP. Fairfax Media said last month it was axing a quarter of its newsroom to save Aus$30 million a year in the latest round of redundancies Saeed KHAN, AFP "So that's what Google and Facebook have done... therefore there's not much cake left for firstly the newspapers, but now increasingly television stations as well." Local providers can no longer count on the "rivers of gold" print classifieds to boost income, with digital advertising not yet able to bridge the gap. Fairfax, a takeover target of US private equity giant TPG Capital and investment firm Hellman & Friedman, said last month it was axing a quarter of its newsroom to save Aus$30 million annually in the latest round of redundancies. News has also announced severe cost-cutting, while the country's third-ranked commercial broadcaster the Ten Network is on the ropes after posting dire half-year losses, citing poor advertising spend. A battle is also taking place to win readers. Fairfax, News and ABC are the most-read news websites in Australia, but Britain's Daily Mail, Guardian and the BBC -- which all have bureaus in Sydney -- are making inroads. The British titans were the fifth, sixth and seventh-most read according to March data from audience measuring service Nielsen. - Rich benefactor - RMIT University's Alexandra Wake, a former journalist, cautioned that although the foreigners have produced award-winning work, they could not comprehensively cover Australia because of their smaller footprint. The local media cuts meant they too would struggle to cover the country with the same depth and breath as they had in the past, she said. "The problem is of course, they (foreign media) have very different interests to Australian interests. "If we want a system of democracy as we currently do in Australia where people are required to be informed to make a decision, we need a variety of Australian voices actually telling us what's going on." Australia media graphic Laurence CHU, AFP Her plea to support public interest journalism is reflected in Canberra. Opposition politicians this month pushed for a probe into the role of government and laws in ensuring independent and diverse media. Other avenues of funding -- from philanthropists or non-profit organisations -- have opened up in the United States, where publishers are also struggling, but are less prevalent in Australia. One rare example is internet entrepreneur Graeme Wood, who helped the Guardian launch in Australia in 2013. "If (newspaper publishers) are to survive 10 to 15 years from now, basically they won't be publicly listed and they'll have a rich benefactor," Allen said. "News Limited have one (Rupert Murdoch) currently, Seven West Media (chairman Kerry Stokes) have one currently, but they won't last forever."

The Kodak DC-40 digital cameras’ bulky size was a disadvantage; Photographs courtesy: Sofie Lindberg Shares56 Marisha Karwa | Sun, 21 May 2017-08:00am , DNA Museum of Failure founder and curator Samuel West tells Marisha Karwa there's much to be learnt from failures than from success stories. And he's seeking examples of Indian innovations that bombed Samuel West is candid. The first product that he sourced for the Museum of Failure turned out to be, well, a dud. "I'd ordered the Harley Davidson cologne online, paying a lot of money for it. When I received the package, a small envelope, it turned out to be a tiny, little sample bottle," chuckles the museum's founder and curator. "I now have the real one at the museum." Sitting alongside the iconic Harley Davidson branded Eau De Toilette at the Museum of Failure in Helsingborg, southern Sweden, are products from such reputed companies as Apple (Newton MessagePad and Pippin), Google (Wave platform and Google Glass), Sony (Betamax), Amazon (Fire), Coca-Cola (Blak and Coke II), Lego (Technic Fiber Optic), Kodak (digital camera DC-40) and Colgate (beef lasagne – yes, beef lasagne!). It might seem perplexing to find products and services from the stables of some of the best-known brands and behemoths huddled under a tag that is corporate anathema, but that's precisely what the museum aims to celebrate. "Companies' and governments' fear of failure or being associated with failure makes it impossible for them to learn from the setbacks. The museum's mission is to convey that in order to not bungle up, again and again, we have to pay attention to our failures," says the 43-year-old. "Scientific literature is very clear that there is much more to be learnt from failure than from success." The fall down... Failure, explains West, is a deviation from the expected and/or desired result. For instance, when it was announced in 2001, the makers of Segway wanted it to reach 1 billion in sales quicker than any other product in history. "Its makers wanted the Segway to be to the car what the car was to the horse wagon," says West, a doctorate in organisational psychology. "Segway represents organisational failure. Despite its hefty price tag, the personal transporter has turned out to be a stupid little toy." A similar fate met Nokia's N-Gage model, which sought to combine mobile telephony with gaming but ended up as a clunky device for both needs. Another disastrous product, masquerading as a beauty product, is the self-explanatory Rejuvenique Electrical Facial Mask — an innovation that ditched common sense at the altar of vanity. The museum's oldest exhibit is a 1940s medical instrument called orbitoclast used for "a very, very popular neurosurgery called a lobotomy in psychiatric patients. The tool punched a hole in the person's skull, behind the eye, and destroyed the front part of the brain", according to West. He points out that companies accelerate their path to rock-bottom when marketing teams hype a new product as the next big thing and then fail to meet expectations. "Hyping up sets up a huge risk of failure. It's about finding a balance between promoting, marketing and then delivering." ...makes for tough lessons A failure to learn may well be because of a prestige issue, macho leadership style or the inability of a product team to challenge leadership or voice a contrary opinion. West points out that the aviation industry is a great example of learning from failure. "When an airplane crashes, they don't say, 'Oh foul weather, too bad.' They go deeper and do a thorough investigation. They don't just accept the first best answer," he says, and points to Sony's experience with the Betamax. "Sony failed because they didn't license the technology to other manufacturers. They also didn't form alliances with the entertainment industry. The competition, VHS, had more films than Betamax did, and they used that to their strategic advantage. But later, when Sony launched the compact disc, it first bought CBS Records to ensure that when the CD hits the market, they have a lot of music to put on them. And the CD is a huge success story." Hitting a home run West, who has been collecting failed products for the last two years, started actively doing so last year after he had a eureka moment at the Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb, Croatia. "That's when I realised that I could convey the abstract notion of learning from failure with physical products and items in a museum." Supported by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova, the 500sqm Museum of Failure will open to the public on June 7. While it currently has 70 exhibits — innovative products and services, there are none from South America, Africa, China or India. "I'd love to have failed innovations from all these places to have a more geographically representative collection," he says. "It's not strange that most products have come from the US, northern Europe, the UK or Japan. Historically, these are the places where most innovation has occurred. I hope your readers (in India) send me suggestions." Ask if the museum would put Helsingborg on the tourist map and pat comes the reply: "Am worried about the Museum of Failure being a failure because it's gotten so much global attention that expectations are very high! It's a risk!" Marisha Karwa Info Marisha Karwa enjoys looking for grammatical errors and hacking copies at dna. She also endlessly feeds her team with cakes and cookies.

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 21 May 2017 Varsity seats – to cap or not to cap? by sandra davie Looking ahead: Sunil Chandra, Google’s vice-president for operations and staffing, once said: ‘What counts for Google is not your degree, but what you can do with what you know.’ SOON after Education Minister Ong Ye Kung touched on capping university places, an interesting question was floated online: Should all Singaporeans who aspire to become university graduates be offered a place in the local universities – assuming, of course, that they can benefit from degree studies? Ong, who was speaking at a symposium in Switzerland, had said a country’s education system needs to be aligned with the needs of the economy. In Singapore, this would require capping the proportion of graduates, he said. The 40% cohort participation rate, he added, is the target that the government had pledged for 2020. By then, the ministry aims to provide enough places – over 16,000 places a year – so that four in 10 from each age group can study for a degree in the local universities. It also pledged to support another 10% of each cohort through part-time degree studies. And the Government has kept its promise. Four years ago when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the expansion, the university participation rate was 30%. This August, it will reach 35% or 15,900 places at the six universities. A 40% cohort participation rate is comparable to what many developed countries offer. But should we aim higher? Should we even have a cap? It is worth raising these questions because, at a time when the government is pushing for Singaporeans to keep on reskilling and upgrading so that they can reach their fullest potential, a cap seems counter-intuitive. Many netizens also asked if capping university places is elitist. They felt it would favour junior college students over polytechnic students because it is a fact that more JC students gain places in the local universities than their peers from the polytechnics. Last year, for example, two-thirds of the university places went to A-level holders, while one-third went to diploma holders. But to be fair to the government, the expansion of university places in the last five years has benefited polytechnic graduates more than their junior college peers. One in five poly graduates won a place on a degree course last year. Just four years before that, only 15% – about one in seven – did. That is because the bulk of the new places has been offered by SIM University, now called the Singapore University of Social Sciences, and the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), both of which were set up to offer niche degrees to polytechnic graduates. A polytechnic graduate with a diploma in game design had to previously head overseas to study for a degree in the same field, often at high costs. Now the DigiPen Institute of Technology, considered the Harvard for game design and animation, offers its programmes with SIT and students pay a fraction of the costs. The same goes for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and culinary science. Polytechnic graduates had to head to Australian or British universities to top up their diploma with a degree. Now they have the likes of Trinity College Dublin and the Culinary Institute of America offering their niche degrees here. As Singapore’s economy matures and becomes more sophisticated, there would be a need for workers with deep skills in diverse fields. And if more Singaporeans are keen and can benefit from a degree education, then the government should look at raising the participation rate further. But although I would argue for no cap, I agree with Ong’s point that the university pathway may not be the best route for everyone. As the minister said: In this age when information can be “Googled”, skills are what carry a premium, not degrees. Google has used data analytics for years to figure out how to hire people with the right fit. It found that there is no correlation between its good hires and the universities they come from or their grades. As the technology giant’s vice-president for staffing and operations Sunil Chandra once said in an interview: “What counts for Google is not your degree, but what you can do with what you know.” Ong had said Singaporeans “need to evolve, such that all occupations, crafts and trades – whether the skills are acquired through a degree education or not – are respected and recognised”. I agree. But if Singaporeans are expected to stop holding on to narrow definitions of success and broaden, even redefine them, then the government and employers must lead the way. - The Straits Times / Asia News Network.

Google's Dave Burke: The first rule of Fuchsia is you don't talk about Fuchsia Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/19 11:32am PDTMay 19, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 235 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares324 Android OS News People have been buzzing about Google's Fuchsia project, an open source operating system that popped up on GitHub a few months ago. Some have even speculated that Fuchsia could be a replacement for Android down the road. Someone brought this up at the Android Fireside Chat, and VP of engineering for Android Dave Burke replied by basically not talking about Fuchsia. Here's the full transcript of Dave's answer from the above video. How do you spell Fuchsia? Fuchsia is a[n] early stage experimental project. We, you know, we actually have lots of cool early projects at Google. I think what's interesting here is its open source, so people can see it and comment on it. Like lots of early stage projects it's gonna probably pivot and morph. There's some really smart people on it, people we've worked with who are great. and so [it's] kind of exciting  to see what happens. But it's definitely a diff-- sort of independent project to android. and yeah, that's basically it. So, there's not much there, is there? Basically, we don't talk about Fuchsia. There's only a little useful information, which will hopefully calm everyone down. The gist seems to be that Fuchsia is still very early, and it's likely to change a lot before it ever gets close to being a real product. And importantly, it's independent from Android. In that respect, it was a little weird to ask the Android team about Fuchsia at all. Tags Android Fuchsia io17 io2017 video subscribe ...

Fuchsia is to Android as Singularity was to Windows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(operating_system) needa A little off subject. Any news of assistant, or a decent GNow version on Chrome? Or wait for Fuchsia? David Hyman I can't wait for assistant to come to Chrome. I also really hope they bring android apps to chrome too, not chrome OS but chrome proper. Those two things would be awesome Spencer Google released the Assistant SDK recently so someone could probably wrap the Assistant into a Chrome extension 🤔 David Hyman I am hoping someone actually does that! In fact that's what I tried to do, but my code skills are awful! boop Android apps aren't built into Chrome on Chromebooks, but in the underlying Linux implementation, parallel to Chrome. So I can't see that ever happening. David Hyman They are in a container though so maybe it's possible! I'm gonna hold my breath just in case! Timbets Title gives an impression that it is an actual quote Artem Russakovskii If we added quotes, maybe. But otherwise, it's an editorialized title with a clear movie reference. Bartek Juszczak It still seems like David Burke is making the reference David Especially when the same reference has been used before by Googlers themselves when talking about Android. No big deal in the title IMHO though. Kellijerickson Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sl206c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Teja Didn't you see Fight Club? Alvin I wouldn't say if I did. Peter Miller Yeah, but I, too, thought that the Google VP might had made a reference to fight club or at least said something like that he/Google won't talk about it or that its secret or whatever, but he simply answered that its an early project and that he and his team are not responsible for it. abc Yeah, but it was a very forgettable movie. Miku is Best Vocaloid Edwart Norton and Brad Pitt are the same guy. mola2alex Dammit, was going to watch it tonight, thanks a lot Artem Russakovskii That was a jerk thing to do. I deleted his comment. Zeek Hahahahahaha instinct I didn't think for a second that was really a quote. Mahdi Only time will tell... Stephen Sharp I'm glad they are independent. Would like to see Android continue using Linux as they are my two favorite things lol. Plus, Desktop Android + Wayland + Bash is all I ever need abqnm Ah, so like many Google projects, this one will also be schizophrenic. Nick Cannon What's the big deal? Fuchsia is a project that will be released in beta and Google will later kill off mola2alex Or have 5 of them existing all at once competing with each other with overlapping features and Target markets James Donut That's unlikely since they already invested alot of time and resources developing it. makapav Hangouts? Orkut? Google+? James Donut Orkut is replaced by Google+, Google+ is still maintained, as well as Hangouts h4rr4r Hangouts is living on borrowed time. It is losing sms support and duo and allo will replace it because they have more stickers. James Donut Nope, Hangouts will not fade away. Out of the 3 google message platform, it's the only one that has link to a google account (the other 2 relies on Mobile # as identification)... Btw, stickers can be easily added by google, it's not a big of a problem h4rr4r Tell that to Google. I keep trying to use Hangouts and they keep removing features. Stickers are dumb, I was mocking Google. Cheer Chunhao Nah not really, it will go pass the beta stage and be commercially available. Only 2 years later that they will silently abandon it. Lord Argyris Still looks like Vileplume. jm9843 "But it's definitely a diff-- sort of independent project to android." Translation: it's an independent project that will include binary compatibility with Android. And as such, may have the capacity to one day replace it. fahadayaz I heard exactly the same thing makapav He's basically scared of his job and has his fingers in his ears ;-) HiroRoshi Some tidbits about it here.

Testing concepts, languages, systems, ect. Sounds prudent, I get it. Also sounds a long way off from being a tangible product. Hexlattice That response of his looks like the type Trump would give! Adam Margeson His is more cohesive than Trump's. Trump's speeches tend towards a 3rd grade literacy level. But, yeah. The denial and deflection was just as apparent. Hexlattice Couldn't have put it better myself. And glad you saw what I meant by my op James Donut Android is the Present.... Fuchsia is the Future Denholm Willmer fuchsiapolice.com instinct YOU PIVOT. Jay Just like how they're not talking about their messaging problem. Dustin Boyd Clickbaity title? Check! What we've seen so far has been buggy and incomplete, to the point that I wouldn't even call it an alpha release. Why respond to hype with info that may change at some point before a proper reasonably solid release? Perhaps we learned nothing from all the hype surrounding Windows Vista's release so many years ago (WinFS anyone?) abc The first rule is that Fuchisa is crap that will either never be released, or like other Google products released and subsequently abandoned. I will enjoy the fanboys masturbating to it though. b0b Google science project abandoned in .... 1 .... 2 .... 3. Paul M Power consumption is going to be a problem - we'll need 1.21 jiggawatts to get back to the fuchsia. Lord Ravenor I wonder if this will just wind up being the front-end system for Google Home/Google Home with a display? Roh_Mish Knowing google, they might very well keep both android and fuchsia development going on in parallel in future too. Or it might be an eventual replacement for Android Go, Chromecast, google home, android Auto, wear and other non phone ventures from google. Considering how locked down and API centric all these products are google can eventually move away from android based OS to fuchsia for them since almost no native code from app devs are run on these devices natively (well except for go) and if done right could mean these devices get Bette reithout breaking any of the apps on these devices. It's hard for Android since unless you are willing to bring everything from Android back to fuchsia you can't run every app on it and if you do then this project is meaningless. h20ray https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9e27f15b4ed7d193926bea66197042bced4e97d0b9a96192923ebfe77c18661.png ddevito Bullshit.

Some of them were previously present in Assistant, at least at some unofficial level, but now French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Japanese support will be arriving soon, and more languages like Italian, Spanish and Korean will be added by the end of the year. Google has been focusing a lot at this year's I/O with expanding the tools available in the Assistant, and it's great to see it spreading to more countries and platforms between the new languages supported and coming iOS support. There's no word on how Google Lens might fit into foreign language support, but the translation features in it will probably compliment the new language support very well. Here's looking forward to more info on when the added language support will land, outside of their current prediction of "this summer."

Our to-do had an erroneous comma, and I was in super-rush mode. Fixed! Rafael Freitas So Assistant won't be available on Portugal anytime soon, great job Google. 👍🏻 Ailín Ó’S Portugal is a small market for Google unfortunately. The only reason the Portuguese language is there to begin with is for the Brazilian market. Filipe Santos That's what I always said, Google only cares about $$$ and testing so they choose Br. Also, pt-br should be a damn language because they speak so freaking bad compared to pt-pt, they write the way they speak and they speak the way they think it's written, got it guys? I don't care if that country have 2 or 200 million people, most of them don't even know how to write or speak properly basic words. vyktorjonas Portugal population is currently 10 million, Brazil is 220 million, their decision is understandable abc More Brazilians speak Portuguese than Portuguese people. lol. enrico meloni When will Italian be supported? Never? Salvatore Iuzzolini By the end of this year Nuno G. Now with this, can we at last get Pixel sold on more play store countries?!? And Amazons, and so on... Ramsey I'm in UK with a nexus 5x and I still don't have Google assistant!!! Gblandro Brazilian it's not a language, I'm Brazilian. Here we speak Portuguese John Maverick They don't care. The Muricans think Brazil is in West Africa. Jim Fox Not true! We think Africa is a country! Dennis Fluttershy If Norwegian and Swedish can be two languages, If Croatian and Serbian can be two languages, Then why can't Brazilian and Portuguese be two languages? abc Same reason English and American can't be two languages. Dennis Fluttershy I mean, I know English is considered the same language, but they still could call it two different languages. Croatian and Serbian are called two different languages even though they're almost the same. Urdu and Hindi are the same language, just with two different scripts. (Serbian Latin and Serbian Cyrillic is the same language with two scripts). I see no issue in calling it just Brazilian. bejli Except that they are not almost the same (Croatian and Serbian). Try using the wrong one in other country. Dennis Fluttershy Um... my Serbian friend is using words that are showing up in the Croatian translations more than in Serbian translations. It works just fine. John Maverick For the Muricans now Brazilian is a language. Long live the third world. Álvaro R. Brazilian is NOT a lang!

[Update: O DP2 broke notification channels] Android O feature spotlight: Android tells you if an app is displaying a screen overlay 2017/05/21 3:30pm PDTMay 21, 2017 View All 56 Articles In This Series Downloading massive files isn't always convenient, especially if you don't have great Internet. And unless you've still got an unlimited data plan, letting the download continue while you're on the move without WiFi is just a bad idea. Google seems to agree, as Android O's second developer preview now features a 'pause download' button.   Pausing downloads on Android isn't exactly new; for instance, it's been in Chrome's built-in downloader since Chrome 50. It is extremely helpful, though. Imagine that you've got incredibly slow WiFi at home and you're trying to download a large OTA, but you have to head off to work, where there isn't any WiFi. Without the pause feature, you'd either have to leave your phone at home, or you'd be stuck in a whole loop of re-downloading the same portion of the update every night. Obviously, this is a somewhat niche situation, but it does show the practicality of such a simple addition. The 'pause download' button may also be restricted to larger updates. We didn't recall seeing it (or getting any tips about it) for the minor 0.019 update we saw the day before yesterday, but we did for the larger update that was sent out to fix the previous one for Nexus devices. This would make sense, as pausing a download for a ~50MB update wouldn't really be necessary. We're still finding little quirks in Android O DP2, so stay tuned. Update 1: 2017/05/20 2:29pm PDT Elliott Hughes, an engineer at Google, spotted this article and made a few observations in a Google+ post. Firstly, the 'pause update' button is actually part of a new Play Services update, though we're not sure which version exactly. Secondly, the feature isn't actually restricted to larger updates, as we'd initially speculated; it's just hard to notice on smaller downloads. And lastly, it turns out that interrupted downloads should have picked up from where they left off. So while my very specific example may not have been accurate, putting a visual cue to pausing/resuming is definitely helpful.

Ever since I've started using the S8+, pure Android seems really boring. You either need to root and use xposed which isn't available for nougat yet or flash a custom rom. Rod Or use it the way it is. Juliaekull Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Aaron Samsung user seem to think "boring" is a synonym for "not bloated". If you're a fan of Samsung that's fine. Every once in a while Google actually releases important upgrades under the hood and Samsung will always be way behind on updates because of all the bloat. Just saying. Vinayak Prabhu I'm a Google fanboy who has used just nexus devices for the last 5 years or so. I had to flash a custom rom on it to get the features which I want on my phone. Why can't Google look at other oem skins and see how much feature packed they are and at least cherry pick the useful stuff? I used to think Samsung phones have bloated stuff on them as well. But most of the apps can be uninstalled now and since of the stuff Samsung has bundled is actually useful. The screen, design and overall feel of the device is far better than any of the 3 nexus/pixel devices I've used. Is it as snappy as the pixel/3t? Certainly not. But the pros far outweigh the cons.. At least for me. Bidiminished And once in a while Google releases a feature that was found on Samsung phones or custom ROMs for years. Fingerprint scanner API, multi-window, quick toggles, privacy guard. Maybe a proper backup application, dark mode, ambient display, status bar brightness control and volume rocker music control in the future? Aaron The framework for backing up app data is there already, if that's what you're talkies about. App devs just aren't using it. Night Light is available on the Pixels, so there's dark mode. Ambient display and brightness slider are there, too. Google had been cherry picking features and ideas from OEMs and the custom ROM community for years. AOSP and Google's ROM may not have all the features available on other ROMs, but minus the stuff Google has already borrowed, how much of those "features" do people actually use on a regular basis? Bidiminished If the framework is there but not all devs use it then I reckon the implementation isn't good enough. We should be able to force the backup of data like TiBu or iOS. I find many of the features of non-stock ROMs be subtle but smart and useful. They're not big gimmick-ish features like S-Connect or HTC's dynamically changing home-screen apps but I do use them daily. E.g. double tap status bar to lock, status bar download progress. The improvements to stock android (PIxels don't run stock android) are making custom ROMs less useful but Google aren't fully there yet. saf1927 There's basically nothing I need root for. In fact, my Pixel XL still has a locked bootloader. My Nexus 5 does have a custom ROM, simply because otherwise it would be stuck on Marshmallow, whereas I wanted to get Nougat on it too. Anyway, if you like your Samsung device, good for you. However, most of the stuff from GraceUI/TW never gets traction, despite Samsung being the best selling Android brand. Fingerprint sensor? Before Android supported it, Samsung did it to copy Apple. Now, pray tell, how many apps actually decided to support their API? Once Google developed their own API on Marshmallow, major apps started to support fingerprint sensors. Samsung had quick settings before Android did, but which implementation is better? The one that can be customised by the user, with custom tiles, or one that only has a set of tiles that Samsung decides? There many other examples. Being loaded with 100 features doesn't necessarily mean you have it better. Meanwhile, while we can benefit from stuff like the autofill API with our password managers as soon as Android O is released, you'll be stuck on Nougat for probably six months or more. james fuston You're mocking Samsung for following Apple's lead, then praising Google for taking the same "wait and see" approach Apple does in the same paragraph. Interesting approach. saf1927 There's nothing wrong in copying, since Apple set the trends for pretty much everything. However, Samsung's approach to copying Apple always results in half-assed features with rudimentary functions. For example, many OEMs started making dust and water resistant phones, which Sony used to do years before them. I won't say they copied Sony, however, since they started doing that when it became mainstream. james fuston > There's nothing wrong in copying, since Apple set the trends for pretty much everything Apple generally waits until things have been around for at least 2 years before incorporating them. And with the existence of Samsung Pay and MST, I'm not sure how you think Samsung's are "always" half-baked compared to Apple. My name is…. I agree with you, but in this community you will be downvoted to eternity.. Google phones suck, no real iphone contest from Google. Tr3ple Have your used the pixel? It's the best Android phone I've ever owned or used, fuck that laggy bloated s7 egde I had smh My name is…. Ι own an 1+3, does it qualify? Pixel is way overpriced, i feel sorry for your purchase. Tr3ple Oh don't fell sorry, cuz I don't, like I said until you use it STFU, I know people with 1+3 that wishes they had a pixel. 3t is a great phone but nowhere near pixel, it's that simple. My name is…. I wouldn't touch a pixel, its a disgrace to buy that fugly phone at that price. I would be better off with an iphone at that price. You wouldn't know, of course, you are a fanboy so you stfu and don't bother me any more. Tr3ple I'm nowhere near a fanboy, as I stated before I had a s7 edge, your budget phone is nowhere near the pixel, I just give praise when it's due, and pixel is better than ALL the previous phones I owned, Samsung LG HTC iPhone one plus 1 etc.. use one than we can talk "fanboy". Foh Tuấn Ankh Let us know what's so great about it. :) Tr3ple Buy one ;) and see for yourself My name is…. Not all people are victims TegTronix™ Certified Dealer The OnePlus 3T has been proven to outperform​ the google Pixel XL in most tests. Well, besides the camera, but who the hell uses the camera so much in a phone? I'm sure 1080p is enough, nonetheless. 6gb of ram is a huge jump, and the OP5 is going to KO alot of phones, including the GS8+. Sorry, but the pixel wasn't that great, Nexus will never be replaced so easily. Vin Super Had one and it was pretty standard, besides the battery which sucked af. Couldn't even listen to music for one hour w/o losing 10% battery. Oh and it barely lasts one day. I was always at 20% or less when i finished work. My 3T today has still 37% left after 21 hours. I believe the majority here agrees that the Pixel Phones are overpriced and that's not even Google bashing. It is a fact. Same applies for Samsung, LG, Sony, Apple and every phone above 500 to 600$. You just pay for their so called innovations like Bixby, Force Touch and all that bullshit. But it is nice that you are satisfied with your phone. Nothing else matters in the end. Tr3ple Dk what you talking about my pixel XL 35% after 24 hours. But you're right nun sale matters :) and I doubt u had one, but good day sir. Vin Super What you doubt isn't important at all. I know i had one and it's not important if you trust me or not. My name is…. No, you cant compare Pixel phones to Apple/Samsung/LG and the rest and say all are overpriced. Pixel is way more overpriced and offers very little. At least, rest of companies offer something. Samsung offers edge screen. LG offers second wide Camera Apple offers 4 years of updates and incredible A10 + NAND Pixel only offers vanilla, its hardware is boring, its software is boring. Vin Super So we have a edge screen, the widest camera, 4 years of updates and A10 plus NAND. All of these, besides the 4 years of updates, are placebo features for me. Nothing what really differs in the usage between a premium and a middle class phone. You are right that they offer something, but nothing what justifies a price ranged between 700 to 1000$. My name is…. A10 and crazy fast NAND is placebo? 0_o Second wide angle camera, superfun to use is placebo? 0_o The minimum bezels and ultra premium design of Samsung is placebo? 0_o Bleeding edge tech dude, you can argue if its useful or not, but you gotta pay it. As an ex LG G5/Iphone 6s/S6 edge user, i found beauty and usability in all of those. thereasoner He's got a point. A10 will get you certain game apps open a bit faster and irrelevant benchmark bragging rights but not much else in the real world. Outside of opening some game apps my Pixel can match the iPhone or better it. Second lens is certainly not a necessity, more people will understandably value better low light performance and/or faster focus over a "super fun" toy. Lots of people are wondering just how they are going to hold the phones these days with such small bezels. Smaller is good, too small is not. There is great things offered in most all flagship quality devices these days and each has advantages over the others. It's not about what best anymore, there is no absolute best phone, only what's best for the user based upon that individuals wants and needs. thereasoner Pixels offers excellent performance, the best Android has to offer, even faster than the iPhone in common everyday smartphone tasks like the FP sensor, cameras, browser etc. It has excellent support, both for direct updates as well as live support 24/7 on the device itself. It has one of the highest rated cameras, free and unlimited full resolution storage with smart storage for video and photos, offers some of the latest features and tech available in VR and AI and has a solid quality build with fantastic displays. The Pixel 2 could use better water resistance, join the new trend towards smaller bezels in the design and perhaps add wireless charging since more companies are doing that now but to say that the original Pixel has nothing to offer over other brands is just ignorance to say the least! My name is…. "nowhere near the pixel" and my phone has same SoC, faster NAND, better battery life, is thinner and better-looking, has 6gb ram, charges faster and has better audio on headphone jack. Ignorance IS bliss. Tr3ple No you're the ignorant one, the pixel is smoother 6gb don't mean shit on a phone lmao, better camera, ufs 2.0, better camera, better battery, 1440p, faster updates , touch latency, etc lol, your CHEAP phone downstairs compare just let it go, only thin 3t has is the price and 6gb of ram lmao, ignorance is bliss My name is…. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a douchebag!!!! Tr3ple Naw you're the douchebag cuz your budget phone is not better than the pixel, it's ok, notice I put camera twice? Yeah Pixel destroys your budget 3t ;) My name is…. Get a life dumbass Tr3ple You fisrt dumb fuck Doby Gillis And you're it! Tim Harman I own a Pixel and even I have to agree with this! kabiluddin Trash like you who thinks your choice is the best choice and everyone should buy thing according to your choice needs to stfu. Your name is ....trash.... ( there I fill it for you ). Fayas I can see my Nexus 5X Screenshot :) :D Richard Gao Ah damn, I forgot to thank you. I'll add that now, haha. Fayas That's OK bro. Never mention. Finally got to know what I wanted. For a second I though that it would be Google Play Service function​. Since it's O season mind said it's big O stuff 🙂 Leonardo Baez I used the BETA program for android N and havent any major issues. What about O... its stable enough for a daily used phone? (6P) KT I've been using it on my 6p for the last couple of days since the launch and have not run into any issues yet. If anything battery life seems a bit better Leonardo Baez Thanks aliablow It lags a bit more than N sometimes in certain situations and I had one random reboot. Other than, stable enough for a daily driver. Leonardo Baez Thanks!! Fayas Using on Nexus 5X since DP2 has been resleased. Seems OK for me. But there are some random lagging. Battery life is awesome when the phone is idle. No bugs I found yet to interrupt daily use. Only random lagging at certain times. Leonardo Baez Thank you Ndubuisi Christian Odira I seriously think this has been around in some devices though I'm not sure if I have actually seen it in any device ;) From https://www.naijaandroidarena.com Follow Android Police 1.49M 470k 144k 116k Latest Deals 11 [Deal Alert] 2-pack Samsung fast wireless chargers $55 at Woot ($45+ off) 2017/05/21 10:52am PDTMay 21, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Here are 12 temporarily free and 6 on-sale apps for your post-I/O weekend 2017/05/19 12:59pm PDTMay 19, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Samsung Gear 360 1st gen down to $168.55 on Amazon 2017/05/19 2:06am PDTMay 19, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get a UE ROLL 2 Bluetooth speaker in Sugarplum for just $45 ($55 off) on Amazon 2017/05/18 8:12pm PDTMay 18, 2017 1 [Deal Alert] Celebrate the start of Google I/O with 9 temporarily free and 10 on-sale apps, plus both 0.10 Apps of the Week 2017/05/17 9:09am PDTMay 17, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

The Department of Parliamentary Services regularly releases six-monthly reports on MPs' mobile phone and internet spending details but usually deletes names and phone numbers. However the latest report for January to June 2016 included the mobile phone numbers of most MPs and senators, including many ministers. The only excluded numbers were those of the prime minister, treasurer, attorney-general and a few other senior figures. Former prime ministers Julia Gillard, John Howard and Paul Keating also had their numbers released. Instead of deleting the numbers from the documents, the font for the numbers was coloured white, meaning they could still be accessed using copy and paste. Department of Parliamentary Services chief information officer Ian McKenzie revealed to an estimates committee on Monday the report had been on the internet since December 22 last year and was only taken down in March when a journalist contacted the department. Mr McKenzie said 985 files had been downloaded from the Parliament House website but an unknown number of downloads would have occurred from Google's cache. The contractor, which receives $2500 a month to undertake the job, had since changed its procedures. "We believe sufficient controls are in place to ensure the incident not re-occur," Mr McKenzie said. MPs and senators had been briefed on the breach and some had changed their numbers. © AAP 2017 Politics Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 22 May 2017 | MYT 12:18 PM Uber’s new pricing model tests how much riders will stomach The difference between the calculations of rider fares and driver pay could be the future of Uber’s business. — Reuters Uber drivers have been complaining that the gap between the fare a rider pays and what the driver receives is getting wider.  After months of unsatisfying answers, Uber Technologies Inc is providing an explanation: It’s charging some passengers more because it needs the extra cash.  The company detailed for the first time in an interview with Bloomberg a new pricing system that’s been in testing for months in certain cities. On May 19, Uber acknowledged to drivers the discrepancy between their compensation and what riders pay.  The new fare system is called “route-based pricing,” and it charges customers based on what it predicts they’re willing to pay. It’s a break from the past, when Uber calculated fares using a combination of mileage, time and multipliers based on geographic demand.  Daniel Graf, Uber’s head of product, said the company applies machine-learning techniques to estimate how much groups of customers are willing to shell out for a ride. Uber calculates riders’ propensity for paying a higher price for a particular route at a certain time of day. For instance, someone traveling from a wealthy neighbourhood to another tony spot might be asked to pay more than another person heading to a poorer part of town, even if demand, traffic and distance are the same.  The change stems from a feature Uber introduced last year called upfront pricing. By guaranteeing customers a certain fare before they book, the company said it provides more transparency. But it hadn’t previously said how Uber was estimating those prices and continued paying drivers using the old model.  In an attempt to ease drivers’ concerns, Uber will start reporting the price a passenger pays on each ride, though it will stop breaking out the percentage Uber takes of the fare. The company will also send drivers an updated terms of service agreement reflecting the new fee system. Route-based pricing is currently limited to 14 US cities where Uber offers its carpooling service.  The difference between the calculations of rider fares and driver pay could be the future of Uber’s business. The company said it pockets what’s leftover and could parlay this mathematical framework into moving closer to profitability.  Graf said Uber’s pricing techniques have grown incredibly sophisticated. He oversees a team called marketplace at headquarters in San Francisco that’s staffed with economists and statisticians. Graf, a former Google and Twitter Inc executive, sees financial engineering as a competitive advantage, one way that Uber can stay ahead of Lyft Inc and other ride-hailing operators.  “Google search is very simple to do; it’s very complex what’s happening behind the scenes,” Graf said. “The same thing here. Taking a trip is easy. To make this all work in a whole market, and sustainable, is really, really hard.”  In the process, pricing became something of a black box for passengers and another source of tension with drivers. Drivers accused Uber of cutting them out of income they were entitled to and misleading them about what the company was up to.  During the last year, Uber had attributed price discrepancies to the uncertainty around estimating fares, even as it was experimenting with techniques designed to exploit the imbalance between what customers were willing to pay and what drivers would take.  The Rideshare Guy, a popular blog among drivers, conducted a study in New York City published in May, finding widespread disparities between rider fares and driver pay. Workers weren’t happy. “It is immoral and unethical behaviour,” said Chris Estrada, who drives for Uber in Riverside, California.  Uber has faced a torrent of scandals this year, including a trade secrets lawsuit, sexual harassment allegations, a brief boycott over its ties to the Trump administration and a video showing the chief executive officer arguing with a driver over falling fares. Two of the longest-running criticisms of the seven-year-old company are ones that are sometimes at odds: It loses too much money, and it pays drivers too little. The company told Bloomberg in April that it lost US$2.8bil (RM12.05bil) in 2016, not including its China business.  In the case of upfront pricing, Uber may move closer to resolving investors’ concerns about losses but could alienate drivers along the way. “You know our numbers,” Graf said. “We do want to run and operate a sustainable business.”  “We do want to run and operate a sustainable business.”  Uber said it isn’t hoarding the additional revenue generated from route-based pricing. The company said it reinvests much of it into increasing the number of trips, subsidizing UberPool usage and paying bonuses to drivers. Christian Perea, who writes for the Rideshare Guy, said drivers will appreciate the added transparency around how much passengers are paying. “That is a big deal,” he said.  As Uber experiments with pricing models, complexity could introduce new problems. “Society is more willing to accept wealthy people paying higher fares,” said Chris Knittel, a business professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But if the repercussion of lower fares in lower-income places is longer wait times, that’s probably what they want to keep an eye on.”  With such a dramatic change to pricing, it’s not just drivers Uber has to worry about upsetting. “They could really lose the trust of the riders,” said Glen Weyl, a senior researcher at Microsoft Corp who is studying Uber with the company’s cooperation. Microsoft is an investor in Uber. “It’s a very dangerous moment for them, but there are good economic reasons to do it.”  Uber is a company filled with over-optimisers, who will continue to futz with prices and hope to find equilibrium. “If things are not balanced, we create levers to motivate people to make it balanced again,” Graf said. “There’s choices, right? Always. There’s never, 'I have to use Uber.’” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested French researchers find way to unlock WannaCry without ransom Piracy is theft The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Olympics - Australia closer to sports lottery for funding athletes Family forced to live under flyover Extra ’toppings’ for 35th anniversary advertisement Latest News Amazon sets sights on UK grocery with checkout-free trademark Google woos developers to catch Amazon in digital assistant race WannaCry attack is good business for cyber security firms Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges Amid industry pushback, China offers changes to cyber rules: sources Most Viewed in Tech French researchers find way to unlock WannaCry without ransom Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges Did your package get dumped in transit?

Tiered seating surrounds the large central table and leaves little room for much else. It was the same in January 1836, but Michael Faraday had no choice. He left his cramped lab in the basement of the building in London’s Mayfair and set to work. He put a wooden frame, 12ft square, on four glass supports and added paper walls and wire mesh. He then stepped inside and electrified it. Faraday all but lived in the box for two full days. In that time, with electrometers, candles, and a large brass ball on a white silk thread, he explored the nature of charge. What he discovered transformed how scientists viewed electricity. But the cage itself was simply a means to an end, a way to insulate experiments from the outside world. It hardly screamed applications. Standing on the spot where the box was built, Frank James, the RI’s historian, gives the simple reason: “What was there to protect against electrical charge in 1836?” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Surveillance-safe ... a Faraday window bag Things have, as you would hope in nearly two centuries, changed. Today more than half a million sites found by Google refer to Faraday cages. They keep microwaves in microwave ovens and interfering radio waves out of hospital MRI rooms. Survivalists, with their knack for being distracted by peripheral threats, share tips on enclosures to block electromagnetic pulses that follow nuclear explosions. Companies offer Faraday bags, Faraday curtains and Faraday wallpaper that claim to stop mobile phone and wifi radiation, and shield devices from electronic snooping. In France, entrepreneurs are peddling radio wave-proof underpants. From the Netherlands comes a Faraday container that holds multiple smartphones. The aim is to break our gadget addiction and bring back good old face-to-face communication. It is fair to say that not every product Faraday inspired lives up to its manufacturer’s claims. Metal mesh hats, scarves, shirts, socks, ponchos, hoodies, gloves, capes and leggings are all sold as shields for electromagnetic waves. As happens with clothing items, they have holes for arms, legs, heads and bodies, where waves can stream in. “It’s not a new thing, but more and more stuff is being developed. My personal opinion is that it doesn’t do a lot,” says Frank de Vocht, a senior lecturer in epidemiology and public health research at Bristol University. “There will be a lot of leakage because it’s not a Faraday cage.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A 1962 lecture in Faraday’s science The market for the clothing has grown with recognition of electromagnetic hypersensitivity, or to unroll its official name, idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF). Those affected believe that ubiquitous electromagnetic (EM) waves are to blame for what can be genuinely awful symptoms. But studies point to another cause: placebo’s evil twin, nocebo. Just as positive expectations can turn a sugar pill into a painkiller, so negative ones can provoke real ailments. Metal mesh clothing is not the antidote. It reinforces the belief that electromagnetic waves cause illness and can make matters worse. In the Netflix show Better Call Saul, Jimmy McGill’s brother, Chuck, suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity, and turns his home into an improvised Faraday cage, using tinfoil and space blankets. An earlier TV reference came in the long-running drama Lost, which featured a time-travelling physicist called Daniel Faraday and inspired fan theories that the crashed airplane and parts of the island had acted as Faraday cages.

Photograph: Ben Leuner/AMC In the post-Snowden era, surveillance fears, or perhaps paranoia, has boosted another market for Faraday-inspired products. Metal-lined pouches for smartphones are sold alongside cases for laptops that block in and outgoing signals. Some might even work, though plenty fail to block the full range of phone signals, Bluetooth, GPS and wifi. They are not much help when you actually need to use the device. Once out in the open and powered up, there are endless ways to hack electronic gadgets. Rop Gonggrijp, a Dutch computer expert, showed what sorts of secrets can leak from computers on the radio signals that emanate from active components. He measured electromagnetic waves given off by circuits inside voting machines and found he could tell from 25 metres away when someone had voted. Worse, or perhaps better if you have a criminal mind, he could sometimes distinguish votes for different candidates, because the refresh rate of the machine’s touchscreen dropped when it had to display accented and other modified letters. When Gonggrijp sent the waves he picked up to a speaker, he heard a clear shift in tone when a vote was cast for the major Dutch party, Christen Democratisch Appèl. The Netherlands dumped the machines. As with clothes that claim to block radio signals, there is plenty of overclaiming around anti-snooping shields for computers and everyday gadgets. Ross Anderson, professor of computer security at Cambridge University, has been in the game for decades. “It’s almost all bullshit,” he says. “It’s one reason you might put your laptop with all its top secret stuff in a Scif [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility], rather than let the minister sit with it on a train.” A whole building can be turned into a Scif, which is a souped-up Faraday cage with extra protection to stop secrets leaking down phone cables, power supplies and the like. Or for the more cash-strapped, Scifs can be bought as kits and set up inside embassies’ rooms. Ideally, you soundproof the Scif and play loud rock music outside to overwhelm any audio bugs outside. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Smartphone safety ... a Faraday bag Down in the basement of the Royal Institution, Faraday’s old lab is now part of a museum. On the dark wooden tables and shelves sit generators and sundry gems, from the man’s travelling microscope and a bottle of Thames water (it was so polluted, an appalled Faraday wrote to the Times to warn the public), to what was once the most powerful magnet in Britain, created by looping wire around a link from a ship’s anchor chain. Faraday’s work on electricity paved the way for electric motors, transformers and dynamos, which are still with us in anything that’s electrical. But his true legacy is more impressive still. There can’t be many chemists who became successful while harbouring a deep dislike of such notions as atoms and matter, but in searching for alternatives, Faraday made some seminal breakthroughs. When he stepped out of his electrified cage in 1836, Faraday had shown that electricity was a force, not some imponderable fluid as many claimed. By the time he had shown that magnets could affect light and non-metallic materials such as glass, he was ready to introduce the use of the word “fields” for the first time, now a cornerstone concept in modern physics. To Faraday, science was a way to explore the wonders of God’s work. But his membership of a small Christian sect called the Sandemanians, set up in opposition to the state church, kept him at a distance from the establishment. He turned down a knighthood, and the presidency of the Royal Society twice, perhaps in line with being humble before God. But off the back of his wildly popular public lectures – it was the onset of his 1836 season of talks that forced him to dismantle his first cage after a mere two days – he still became a celebrity. He was one of the most photographed, painted and sculpted figures of the time, and when he died in 1867, a whopping tombstone marked his spot in Highgate cemetery.

Photograph: Science & Society Picture Library/SSPL via Getty Images Margaret Thatcher once called Faraday her hero and his story must have sat neatly with her politics. Born to a poor family, he apprenticed as a bookbinder, taught himself science and rose to international greatness. In a speech to the Royal Society, Thatcher declared: “The value of his work must be higher than the capitalisation of all the shares on the Stock Exchange!” She borrowed his bust from the RI and anyone visiting 10 Downing Street from 1982 to 1996 would have passed Faraday in the hall. She wasn’t the only one to gush. Faraday’s story was hopelessly romanticised. One author wrote that a beneficent fairy stole into his parent’s home in Newington Butts, south London, bent over his bed, and conferred genius on the sleeping infant. In an early bromance, John Tyndall, who performed pioneering work on the greenhouse effect, talked of Faraday’s “divine power” and how his “flashes of wondrous insight and utterances ... seem less the product of reasoning than revelation”. “In terms of scientific research, he outstrips all the popular scientists we’ve got around the place at the moment,” says James, who admits that his enthusiasm for the man so pervaded his home life that his children thought Faraday was the last day of the working week. “To be blunt,” he adds, “Brian Cox hasn’t made the sorts of discoveries Faraday made.” Topics Physics Chemistry Lost Better Call Saul features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?
