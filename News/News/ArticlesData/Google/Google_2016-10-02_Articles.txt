Kara Swisher: Today in the red chair is someone I've tried to get here for a long time, it's someone I've known for a very long time: Bill Gurley, general partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. He's invested in companies ranging from GrubHub to Zillow to Uber and serves on several board[s] of directors. Before he joined Benchmark in 1999, Bill worked at Compaq and spent four years as a tech analyst on Wall Street. Bill, welcome to the show. Bill Gurley: Thanks for having me. We have known each other a long time. Very long time. I knew you as an analyst, I think. Yes. I don't know if I knew you at Compaq, because I didn't cover Compaq. But I did cover, I remember, the CEO at the time. There's so much to talk about; I think people know you really well here in Silicon Valley, but some of our listeners don't. So walk through how you got to Benchmark. I wrote the story when you went to Benchmark, if you recall, in 1999 for the Wall Street Journal. You had been at another venture capital firm. How far back do you want me to go? Well, how did you get into [being a] tech analyst? Let's start with tech analyst and Compaq. I had a computer engineering degree in undergrad, and my sister was a double E [electrical engineering major] out of Rice and was employee 63 at Compaq, so I was exposed … Wow. Where did you grow up? In Houston. So yeah, of course. My father was in the space program, worked at Johnson Space Center. And Compaq was there, right? In Texas. Yeah, and her going through that obviously brought a lot of exposure into our family of being at a startup, and she was given options. And Kleiner was an investor. Oh yeah. I wouldn't have expected to have that exposure that early in my life. I also — like everyone you've probably had in this chair — had a Commodore VIC-20 and used to code out of magazines and stuff like that. I ended up at the University of Florida where I rode the end of the bench on the basketball team and got a comp sci degree. I went to Compaq, where I'd spent some summers, and worked there for a couple of years, and I found I was drawn to a broader calling. I started work on the third PC and it looked a lot like the second and the first. What did you do? I worked in a team that did problem solving. So when a new computer was coming to market, they'd put it into test and it would fail. And my team, we'd get thrown in a room with a logic analyzer — Like, "why isn't this working?" Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was fun. It was fun. This was the '80s, right? Yeah, this was '89 to '91. I remember AOL was on that one computer ... I can't remember. They were all small computers. I had a Prodigy account when I was working there, and I used to trade stocks. I ended up going to business school and then I started trading stocks — Borland went public during that time. And so this combination of being fascinated with technology, looking for a broader thing to do, and then getting interested in investing and tech and disruption, that kind of thing. So I went to business school, I thought about trying to get into venture at business school. I went and met with some Austin Ventures people who said, "Kid, you're way too young, go get 20 years of work experience." Right, because they had operators. That's what they said, yeah. Which is ironic, and I can come back to that, based on how we choose people at Benchmark now. But anyway, while I was at business school, everybody cracks open every Fortune and Businessweek and they read everything because they want to think they are professional business people. And so I was reading about all these amazing analysts at Goldman Sachs at the time, Dan Benton and people like that. And Rick Sherlund. And they were always quoted, like, opining, and I just got interested in it. You wanted to opine. Yeah, I went to Wall Street and just knocked on doors. Like cold, like what you read about. And got very lucky that [Credit Suisse] First Boston gave me an opportunity. Right, which was a big deal at the time. And then two weeks after I joined, Charlie Wolf was there covering PCs, and he announced he wanted to resign and back off. So I went into my tiny little apartment with no air conditioner and wrote a 20-page assessment of the PC industry. What did you tap away on? I don't remember, probably some kind of luggable. I'm thinking Kaypro, perhaps, around then. Trash-80. And I went in and begged for Charlie's job, and was very fortunate. Not only did Charlie share with me all his models, but two of the other ranked analysts, David Course and Dan Benton, who still comes to your conference every year, they gave me all their models and they've all left the field. Oh, where did they go? Dan and David when to the buy side and Charlie went into academia. They just like got out. "We're leaving." Wasn't that a signal to you? "Uh oh, I better get out of here?" It couldn't have been more fortunate, right? Because I moved up through the ranks very quickly. It's an opportunity. That's somewhat how I got my job at the Washington Post. People retired or left. So that was a big event. And then the other big event was at Stewart Alsop's conference, which Charlie helped me get into. Which was the big deal, Agenda. Oh man, you're standing at that first dinner, and there's Bill Gates and Larry Ellison and all this stuff, and you're like, "I'm just a nobody, this is crazy." But anyway, one of those first few years, they were selling a Palm Pilot. And it had the attendees’ contact information in it. Ahh, aren't you clever. And I had just started this newsletter called "Above the Crowd," which was a fax at the time. And so I was just like, "Oh wait, this is too easy." So I paid like $200 for this Palm Pilot and I spammed everybody … … with "Above the Crowd." It was a great newsletter. The most important people in the technology industry. Yeah, you've always been a writer. We'll talk about that soon. It came from the analyst days, because I had to write big, long reports. Absolutely. But they used to write reports a lot better then. There was a lot of people, you know, Mary, you, even Henry Blodget wrote some fantastic stuff, though it didn't end so well for him there. So then — I should hurry this along — so after three years of doing that, I was getting burned out. It's a tough job being an analyst. And I was thinking about going to the buy side and, in fact, had been interviewing with Capital Group in LA ... Right, that's Gordon Crawford. ... who I still have a ton of respect for. And Frank Quattrone called me ... out of the blue, and he had left Morgan Stanley on, I think, Good Friday in '96. We ended up sitting down and he said that he'd like me to join their new firm. And I said, "You know, I'm kind of burned out on this analyst thing." And he said, "Well, what do you want to do, long-term?" And I said, "I'd love to be a venture capitalist." And Frank said, "Why don't I move you to Silicon Valley? You can cover any sector you want, and I'll introduce you to every venture capitalist I know." Well, that's an offer. Yeah. What did he do, take your soul? [BG laughs] Frank kind of looks satanic, so did he say, "You must ..." You know, there are people that are super loyal to Frank and I'm one of them. And when someone makes a commitment like that and helps you get your dream job … And you worked for them. Yeah, I did. And we were very fortunate. We were lead-left on the Amazon IPO, which would be a famous trivia question one day. "Who took Amazon public?" Frank was in the middle of all this. Or else buying and selling companies. He was involved in a lot of that during that time. Yes, and [Jeff] Blackburn was the banker that worked alongside me who then went to Amazon. Before we get ahead of ourselves, what was that period like? Because I was here too. I remember these things. And at the risk of sounding aged, it really was an exciting time. Well, for me, it was my real first exposure to Silicon Valley. I'd been out here a couple times as a PC analyst, but the PC industry wasn't really centered in Silicon Valley. No, it wasn't. IBM and Compaq, and even AST was in Irvine. And Gateway was in Sioux Falls. So I didn't travel here all that much, and then I was just suddenly put here. Because internet, that's why. And by the way, that's the sector that I asked Frank that I wanted to cover, and of course I knew nothing about it, so I went and bought all those TCP/IP books and stuff, which I don't think helped me at all, but I read them anyway. And it was super exciting, you know? And I knew a few people. Like when Frank called me, I called [Roger] McNamee because he had been at T. Rowe, so he was someone I had known from the buy side. And there's a few others like Glen Kacher and some of the Tiger guys. So I called Roger and I said, "I don't know Frank." He's like, "Take his meeting immediately. You have to. This'll get you to Silicon Valley." So it's been great. Roger's always been someone that I've called along the years to help me think through decisions. Yeah, it was so exciting. Like I remember one of the first meetings was in a train caboose for CNET with Halsey [Minor] and Shelby [Bonnie]. And I knew nothing about media or advertising. Right. That doesn't stop many people. And Halsey was just remarkably upset that I wasn't getting it faster, and Shelby, God bless him, was just super calm and casual, bringing me along and teaching me. That was interesting. He used to call me in the middle of the night because he was like, "Why is my story on [page] A22 of the Wall Street Journal and Yahoo's on the front?" Or whatever. And I said, "You're lucky you're on A22, because I got you on A22 or else you wouldn't be there at all." But that didn't end well for Halsey. No. But I've stayed in touch with Shelby. I consider him a wonderful gentleman. Yeah. So then you shifted over to venture capital. I was with Hummer Winblad for 18 months and then came to Benchmark. So that was a big deal, I remember. That was like, gaaah. Like, "You left there?" And they were shifting at Benchmark at the time. Yeah, two weeks after I announced the Hummer Winblad position, Andy Rachleff cornered me at a conference and said, "Dude, why didn't you call me?" And quite frankly, I would have to say I was so fixated [on] being a venture capitalist [that] when someone started to ask me, I'd say, "Yes!" Yeah, take the first date. And they were a well-known firm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm still very close friends with John [Hummer]. I think the cultural fit with Benchmark is just [better]. Yeah. I remember tall, white guys, essentially. Well ... Come on. I sat across from them when they were talking about eBay. When someone approaches you that works for an equal partnership … because everyone else that's working their way into venture starts at the bottom with only a piece of the action, you’ve got to work your way up. Someone else's name firm. It's a pretty compelling offer when someone comes and says, "We want you to be one of us." Absolutely. And you were the tallest of all those tall men. But it did cause reverberations. Everyone was sort of talking, I remember, it was a big deal because you were sort of the bright young thing at the time. Well I guess now that I've been here something like 16 or 17 years, it's probably the right place. Yeah. And it was changing also. It was starting to shift. To a certain extent, the beginning of my venture career was a little bit like being near the top of a roller coaster: Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch. And then it just slammed down before I ever had a chance to really establish myself and build a track record. This was the end of the first internet bubble. And when I first arrived at Benchmark, it was like, "Nothing can go wrong." There was an IPO every week. And they had done eBay. And then, wham! Man, the door came down hard. So what was that like? Because you do write a lot about bubbles. You're like the worrywart of Silicon Valley. And we'll talk about that in the next section. But what was that like, as an early venture capitalist, when you have that happen to you? It's intimidating. I mean, I think for anyone that breaks into venture, years two, three and four, unless you're as lucky as, say, [Matt] Cohler with Instagram or Roelof [Botha] with YouTube, are just anxiety-ridden. People use the metaphor of children: You basically have a bunch of middle-aged teenagers with acne that are awkward and clumsy. And you haven't proven anything. That's if you do early-stage. And so it's a gut check. And it's really helpful — at least it was helpful for me at Benchmark with the equal partnership — there's just this kind of team orientation where, if you feel like you're struggling, people are getting beside you. Yeah, because they all have a stake in it. Yeah, they have a stake in you doing well. It's not an eat-what-you-kill kind of situation. Not at all. So what was your investment? My first investment at Hummer Winblad was a company called Employease, which was SaaS HR. Ah, early. Way before its time. It was like Workday, 10 years early. Or Zenefits. I was just visiting their offices. Very similar. Because we didn't charge the same way, but the same customer set. But it was the beginning of that idea. And ADP ended up buying it for 150 [million]. But we didn't make nearly as much money. And we made a huge mistake by choosing HR instead of sales, because HR is a corporate purchase by someone who doesn't have any authority. And sales is a credit card purchase by someone who has all the authority. So, hard lesson. So you did that. And what was your first at Benchmark? What were you involved in? It was Epinions. Epinions, oh my god. Was that a success or a failure for you? We ended up merging it with Dealtime, it went public, and eBay bought it for $600, $700 million. Yeah, so you feel good about that. But that was a hit company, and then sort of not. It was. It was covered in the New York Times Magazine, and then the bubble burst and then there was a founder split and … Explain Epinions for people who don't know. I remember you on the covers. It was always on the covers, that guy. Epinions was a big UGC idea at the beginning of the internet, which was basically to allow UGC reviews of anything and everything. And they started in the categories more like products. They did experiment with services. And the CEO was? The CEO was Naval Ravikant. Naval, yeah. That's right. An interesting story about him: We ended up splitting from him and there ended up being a lawsuit. And this was, I don't know, 16, 17 years ago. I'd always thought of Naval as one of the smartest people I'd ever met, but when someone sues you, you tend to get on the other side of things. And just this past winter, I was at a ski event that Chris Sacca put together, and he was invited and we sat down and talked for the first time in [ages]. Oh wow. And? It was great. Hugged it out? Yeah, it was awesome. It reminded me of why we worked together in the first place. But I regret that we spent 16 years not chatting. And he's obviously gone on to do some spectacular things. In the next section, we're going to talk a little bit about your philosophies, what you write about, because you write about bubbles and things like that. But what was your philosophy on investing then? What were you doing in the early days? And we'll talk later about how it changed. I think when I was on Wall Street. just devouring any book I could in investing philosophy — I think I bring a structured approach. You're almost academic in the way you think about it. And the way I think about it, which will sound trite, but I'm always looking for some kind of competitive advantage, like some type of unfair ability to compete in the marketplace. I don't get drawn to the kind of enterprise deals that are just, "Who has the better Salesforce, knock them down," kind of thing. People make money doing that. It's a valid approach. I remember the OpenTable scenario. We're meeting with Chuck [Templeton], and he's in, like, three restaurants, and we're like, "How could this ever work?" And you're like, "Well, it can work if we tip it into a network effect and then everyone has to buy it." And that's what played out. It's that kind of thing. So is that what convinced you? Like, what advantage do you mean? In that case, we were betting on the existence of a network effect. And people talk about network effects all the time, but you come up with ways to try and analyze whether it's possible or not. Will more diners lead to more restaurants, and will more restaurants lead to more diners? Are there ways to measure and study that? Or to implement the go-to-market strategy such that it exploits it as much as possible? So does your analytical approach hurt you sometimes? You're not the gut investor that some people are. It can. I think venture's really hard. And there's a lot of luck involved. And mistakes that you make — especially missing ideas — are ... it's called asymmetric returns. But if you invest in something that doesn't work, you lose one times your money. If you miss Google, you lose 10,000 times your money. You have to orient yourself toward — Bruce [Dunlevie] uses the phrase, "What could go right?" And you have to kind of think that way all the time. Oh, that's interesting. And you're more likely, being overly analytical, to talk yourself out of things. Right, right, that's what I mean. And so you have to twist your brain in the right way. Yeah, because you can think of all the wrong things, "What could go wrong?" Yeah. And by the way, the Google example is one that kind of fit that at the time. That was 1998, yeah. Excite was going bankrupt. Yup, they were. And Yahoo's stock had fallen from like 82 to 10. So search didn't look that interesting. And you had two academics and ... There's a venture rule book: "Don't back academics who insist on being CEO." [laughs] So there was a number of things that said, "Don't do it." But two of the smartest investors ever — … Sequoia and Mike Barnes ... — stepped up and did it. They also wanted a price that was seemingly ridiculous, obviously a very good investment. Did you pass on that one? We failed to pursue it. It's always important to state it that way. Because to say "pass" made it sound like we had a chance. I don't know if we had a chance. They presented to us and we failed to pursue it. And if we had, we would have had to compete with two of the best. Right. Absolutely, I remember visiting that garage, Susan Wojcicki's garage at the time. There were 25 employees when I met with them. And they were crazy, let's be clear. They were. And there were a lot of search things that had gone wrong. And Yahoo still was very strong. And, in fact, their big break was when they put Google on the Yahoo platform as the search engine. I remember. And it was a fatal error for Yahoo at the time, even though they got a big stake in it. Yup. So all right, when we get back we're going to talk about how you've developed as a venture capitalist and also some of your writings. Because you always create sort of a big old mess. Like, people start talking about the things you write, especially around bubbles. Recently you've been writing about bubbles, and you've written about them several times. You're sort of the voice of warning in the industry. When we get back with Bill Gurley of Benchmark. [ad] We're here with Bill Gurley of Benchmark, who I've known a long time. We're talking about investing, philosophy and writing about it. Now, you've been very public about your opinions. A lot of venture capitalists are super secretive. You haven't been. You were an analyst before, so you're used to writing and putting your opinions out there, and at various times you've caused sort of a kerfuffle talking about the bubble, right? At the top, where everyone's feeling good, you're like, "Just a second." Sort of like the aunt at a garden party sometimes, talking about how you had written about the trouble a-comin’. This was about six months ago? Yup. I would tell you — as a backdrop, and then I'll dive into it — that I have a philosophy that the very best entrepreneurs are disserved by bubbles. In other words, they would raise money at any time. When bubbles come along, almost anyone can raise money. And so it creates excessive competition, you get companies that are misbehaving and doing things that can disrupt markets. And so I've found, and maybe I'm just a contrarian, but I've found that like 1999 and 2015 were two of my least favorite times in Silicon Valley. Some of it I would tie back to just the behavior you see. You once said — I read something you wrote — you said, "Too much arrogance, too much bullshit will be the downfall of Silicon Valley." And it's interesting because that reminds me of a conversation I was having with Rachel Whetstone, who now runs comms at Uber. Shortly after we met, she said, "Do you watch HBO's ‘Silicon Valley?’" And I said, "No, I don't, I tried to watch the first episode and I didn't like it." And she said, "You have to watch it." And I said, "Why do I have to watch it?" She said, "The rest of the world is laughing at us." And I still to this day think half of the people in Silicon Valley don’t know that it's a parody. Ah, it's true. They like it. They like being paid attention to at all, I think. I'll give you another example of the kind of stuff that just makes me cringe. I was at an investor conference last year in Vegas, a private investor conference. That one, I know which one. Where everything leaks out. That private one. So unicorns are presenting, right? One after another. And I probably sit in on eight unicorn presentations, and five of them use the world "trillion." Now I don't think I had heard the word trillion in an investor presentation before that day. That's a big dream. But we had done something in the ecosystem to encourage this type of outlandish promotion — Going to the moon. — where you feel like you need to use words like trillion. And I think it's dangerous when we act like we have the right to disrupt everything or eat every industry, but we're not willing to play by the rules of profitability or GAAP accounting or being public. We look like entitled brats. And I think the end state, the really bad end state of that type of behavior, is we invite regulation from Washington that I prefer we not have. But I think that's possible if we play it too loose. If we play it too loose, if we talk about all these numbers ... Every three or four years, the [Wall Street] Journal has a story about the parties. I think they just recycle the same story, I don't know if it's so much the party ... What I was talking about in that quote was, I was interviewing an author who was writing about how innovation dies and how it's created. And someone asked me, and I said, "Well, it's going to be that. It's the same thing every time." And people discount risk slowly. Like they forget about pain and they forget about layoffs and they forget about that this is supposed to be hard, you need to profitable. And the younger generation, they're taught in very short time windows. So most of the entrepreneurs today weren't around in '99. So they've forgotten. They have no muscle memory of it whatsoever. There is also a mentality, though. If you have a depression-era mentality, you don't do anything, too. That's true, that's true. Absolutes on either end aren't going to get you anywhere. And, in fact, I would suggest that there are two types of entrepreneurs. There's the incredible operator who might be a COO, they hate these times. Because they can't promote. And then there's this hyper-promotional person that only comes to Silicon Valley when the time is right, and then they go away. And boy, those drive me crazy. You start to see the scammers. And you see it in the deal flow, so it goes from being 10 percent hyper promotional to 90. And I've even heard stories that I find hard to believe, but I've heard stories of reputable people in Silicon Valley, "You should overstate your numbers in your fundraising because everyone's doing it and everyone's just going to discount them anyway." If people are really doing that, it's distasteful, you know? Let's talk about what you wrote about the bubble. What were your main worries, and how do you look at them now? There was just an article in the Journal talking about how people are fixing themselves. Do you think that's the case? Somewhat, yeah. I mean look, the piece that Sequoia did, the deck that Sequoia did in ‘09 was extremely helpful to the Benchmark portfolio. Because you went into that next board meeting and everyone had kind of reevaluated where they were. And Katie Benner — who wrote that story that you're talking about — called me and said she started researching this topic and she started calling entrepreneurs, and some of the stuff I had written had inspired them to change their behavior. So that actually means a lot to me if that was a result. If we play these bubbles out, if we just get extremely promotion-to-the-end-state, then you have the type of crash you had in '01, which is complete wipeout. Like, 50 percent of people get laid off. And it'd certainly be better if we can avoid that kind of thing. Are you, as venture capitalists, sort of responsible and indulgent of these entrepreneurs? Because you have Mark — and you were talking about it, but Mark's knocked up the prices. You all knock up the prices quite high. I think everybody, to a certain extent, has to play the game on the field. I like to use the example of Hortonworks and Cloudera. So we're in this company Hortonworks, it's a Hadoop company. Cloudera raises $950 million from Intel. What do you do? You could sit around and say, "We're going to get to profitability," but you're not going to matter. You might as well lock the door and leave the building. So you're forced into a game of capital warfare that you may have not been ready to play. And so I don't know that any one person is responsible. Silicon Valley and venture capital have always been cyclical. And so there's something about human nature that causes us to be increasingly risk-seeking until someone comes along and really punishes everybody. There was that study in Iceland where the banks started taking risks — it's often men, I'm sorry to say, but women don't take the same risks. [Men] underestimate risk rather severely. Right, and there's tons of books that have been written on different types of asset bubbles. There's another contributing factor, I think, right now, which is [that] we've had low global interest rates for the past seven years. And I was fortunate enough this summer to meet Warren Buffett — Chamath [Palihapitiya] was the one that made that happen. But we only had one question each, and I said, "You know, in our industry we're seeing that low interest rates are leading to overt competition that's irrational." And he says, "You bet it is." And he's seeing it in his business as well, and I think it's played out in natural gas and all these other pockets. Real estate in Silicon Valley, right? All these asset prices, because with interest rates so low you just have people looking for yield, so money sloshes around. I always say there's not enough rat holes to shove it all down in Silicon Valley. It's true. I would have never imagined in my life as a venture capitalist that the biggest problem would be too much capital everywhere. So what do you do? Here you are, trying to compete with your Hadoop company and others, what do you do? Do you discipline yourself or do you just go along for the crazy ride? I write about what could go wrong in the hope that it might correct something, but I may not have been very successful at that. You play the game on the field, and the game on the field may be particularly sloppy. You're trying to outraise one another, which perpetuates the problem. You out-hype each other. Yeah. You try and spend more efficiently, even though everyone's losing way more money. And one of my biggest things that I've said about this current time is the risk we're taking because of the size of the losses. If you go back to ‘99, there were a whole bunch of companies going public and everything, but people were still moving towards profitability at $30 or $40 million in revenue. And this is way different. There's way fewer companies, whatever the number of unicorns is, but they're being given piles of money. Hundreds of millions. And burn rates are areas we've never seen before. And steering those back towards profitability, if capital ever becomes scarce, is going to be a really difficult exercise. So how are you going to do that? I don't know. "Put down that free kombucha shake right now!" And look, there's been some things that I think have been super helpful. Tomas speaking out on Kind bars and brick walls, and then you know, this summer over at Dropbox, Drew Houston went out, it looks like he did a press tour about cutting $35 million of perks out of Dropbox and did it in a way that he was proud of. And you've had the Evernote thing as well, where they've corrected some of that stuff. And seeing him as a leader talk about that as a smart exercise is awesome. And a sign, like some of the stuff that Katie wrote about, that we're moving back in the right direction. Do you ever feel you can do anything else to impact entrepreneurs besides writing? What would you write right now, if you were doing that essay? I've got an unwritten blog post about unit economics. One of the things that Silicon Valley does when it gets risk-seeking, which it did in '99 and now, is they invest in businesses with lower and lower gross margins. And that's riskier. And a lot of times those involve consumer products. And then what they do is they start selling them heavily discounted. And there's this old saying about selling dollars for 85 cents. But there's a truism to it. You can create infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85 cents. And if you give consumers more value than you charge them for, they will love you. And I remind entrepreneurs all the time that Webvan had the highest NPS scores of any company I've ever known. It wasn't that the consumer proposition didn't work, it was that the economics didn't work. They weren't charging enough for the service level. What's interesting about that is that conceptually, it was the right idea. A lot of things are directionally correct, but it wasn't working out on an economic basis. They should have been charging more money, basically. Anyway, we're in one of those time frames. Some of that's starting to get cleaned up. There's probably been more shutdowns this year than in the previous three. Or sales. Or sales. And layoffs. You're starting to smell for the first time. I've heard signs of some real estate correcting. I'm hopeful that it can be a soft landing. Historically, it hasn't been. Right. What could happen? Oh, what could happen? I mean, macro is really hard to get right. And Buffet and those guys don't even try. We've got an election, we've got so much going on. I think the European situation is probably a bigger hotbed. If Italy or something defects from the EU, and the kind of thing that could cause. China's GDP, a lot of people are worried about. I don't have enough knowledge to know whether that could be the catalyst, but it could be. We're talking to Bill Gurley about investing and the bubble and some of the things he's written about it. When we get back, we're going to talk about his current investments and some other thoughts that he has going forward. [ad] ************* We're here with Bill Gurley, the well-known venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who works at Benchmark. He's been involved in lots and lots of companies. He was an analyst before that, but he's one of the most high-profile venture capitalists, VCs, in the Valley. Today, the Journal had a piece about how you guys are doing pretty well. Little bit of smack-around of Andreessen Horowitz. How do you judge yourselves? It's difficult. The venture industry, as I mentioned earlier, you have to be very fortunate to fall on what people sometimes refer to as positive black swans, these break-out plays. And I think you could spend your whole career and do extremely well and never get behind one of the ones: A Facebook, a Google, that kind of thing. And it's almost impossible to predict ahead of time what's going to turn into something like that. And so it just creates a ton of anxiety. I would also say that it's an extremely cyclical business and so you might be doing well in '99 and really eating crow in '01 or '02. And so it goes up and down and it's hard. What we try and do internally is we keep track of what we're doing, what our competitors are doing and what are the deals or investments that we regret not doing. And we just constantly talk about it. What are the regrets? What are the investments? We'll talk about the ones you've done. Right now? It's the obvious ones. It's Airbnb, Pinterest, Slack, GitHub is one that we're fascinated with. I think the Collison brothers at Stripe are … Which you didn't do? Which we didn't do. I like them more than their business, but I really like them. Pinterest? On them, it's just like the thing I said about growth mindset. Like, learn-it-alls. They're nuts. They're just begging for information, which I love. I think with Pinterest it's just the size and scope. It got way bigger than we would have predicted. And the others? Slack, I think it's fairly obvious. It's a viral enterprise tool. And you didn't think that would be. Well, there had been Yammer. It was a pivot, it was a game company. Yeah it was, I remember. You can't kiss them all. And Airbnb, you know, Matt brought it in like his first week he had joined us. And we got caught up on one of our rules about ownership and redid it for a lower ownership. One of your rules. Do you think you should have rules? What are your biggest rules? You try to maximize ownership, take a board seat. There aren't that many [rules]. No academics in garages. You can get into trouble. And one of the games you play in venture is to know which rules to break at the right time. And so we constantly challenge ourselves. Like, "Should we maybe be dropping this rule at this moment in time because things are changing?" Does that make you the most insecure people on the planet? It might. It feels like it sometimes. Chasing the breakout. And when the close happens on one of those, it's actually a really perverse element of the venture industry. Like the moment that John Doerr and Mike Moritz closed the Google investment, which was probably all of a week and half, it was the biggest event in both those firms for over a decade. Yeah, without even knowing it at the time. And something had happened in a week and a half. And for a lot of those companies, and I'll include the ones we're in, if you worked there it probably would have come out that way anyway. So the seminal event was that closing event that was very quick. Right, and decisions were made quickly. Often on a instinct, actually. And in that case, like we talked about previously, most people's instincts would say, "Don't do it." So talk about what you did do. Obviously your biggest — there's a couple at Benchmark, but Uber is one of your big ones. I've talked to all of you about how that happened and various people, of course, take credit all the time and this and that. But it really was Matt and then you others there. And it went back and forth actually, initially. Having come out of OpenTable being successful, I was trying to think of other industries where, if you put a network on top of [it, that] would absorb waste and make it more efficient and more usable. And the thesis of cars had come up, and we had met with several taxi [startups] — there were actually taxi startups before Uber. And we had quickly come to the conclusion that doing it on top of taxi wasn't the right way to do it because prices were fixed, they’re oligopolies, there's regulation, and if anyone did it on town cars, we would pay attention. So that was a thesis we had internally when they popped up. Which was a town car kind of offering. Ride in style, whatever it was. Yeah, so we immediately cold-called them, and I remember meeting with Ryan and Travis at a restaurant and then I brought them [in]. This was before their seed round, and this is the part you're talking about about going back and forth. And they presented the company to us for the seed round and we chose not to do it at that point in time. And then for the next three or four months … What that like, Calacanis and Sacca were in that one, right? That's right. And then over the next three or four months Matt became, I think, the No. 1 rider on Uber. And as he's done many times in our partnership — … This is Matt Cohler ... — he came into the room screaming, "We have to do it! We have to do it! We have to do it!" And so we got aggressively in front of the series A. And what did you think at the time? What would happen here? Of the entrepreneur, Travis, and obviously Garrett Camp was involved and others. Between the time we looked at the seed and when we did the A, Travis had moved into the CEO position. At the beginning we were just studying him as an angel investor in the thing, and probably by the time the A came around he was the CEO. It was hard. Like I said, we had a theory that it could be like OpenTable. So you know, OpenTable was sold for like $3 billion or something. So I'd be inaccurate if I suggested we had a vision that it could one day cause people to question car ownership. I never had considered that. And what do you think of the person? He's quite aggressive. He is, he is. So Matt had known him for a while. I actually called Mark Cuban, because Cuban had been an investor in Red Swoosh, and they had ended up in a disagreement, yet Mark had walked away thinking Travis was remarkably professional even though they had different points of opinion, which I took as a positive. I like to think I knew how passionate he was. But I didn't. We were taking a chance. I'm remarkably thrilled, now that we're involved, to see a guy who's just so committed to what he does. Right, but some say too committed, too aggressive. Do you provide, "Slow this the hell down, stop arguing with people." You know, it's funny, in the book I mentioned earlier, "Grit," this woman Angela Duckworth had studied all these people that have been successful. And she claims, and there's a big TED video that's only six minutes which is quicker to watch than reading the book, but she says the key characteristic that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful isn't IQ, it's grit. And she describes grit as passionate perseverance. And on those two dimensions, I think Travis may be completely on the far rail. One of the board members described him as "remarkably all-in." You know? Yeah. But that can become abrasive and irritating, which to many it has. Completely understand. I do think that most VCs would probably yearn for most of their founders and CEOs to have some of this grit. Does that have to change, and do you have an impact on that? I think every one of the entrepreneurs that gets thrown into the limelight in the way that he has — And with failures before. He really did have a lot of trouble. By the way, I think those contribute to the grit. Oh absolutely, I think it's right at the heart of it. He spent so much time on these startups and one of them went bankrupt and one he sold for $20 million. And in the first one he sort of got screwed by his investors. Absolutely. And just years and years of trying. I often think that the grit is driven by some kind of obligation to the Entrepreneur Society of America. Because he knows how hard it is to be on one of the ones that's not working. Yeah, I felt it was rage. It was just like, "This one's going to work." And so you get on one that has the wind at your back instead of your face and you're like, "I'm going to play it for all it's worth." And I do feel like that's part of the motivation. So, just finishing up on Uber, obviously you're on the board, correct? Correct. When is it going public? You know, I don't think that we're going to be going public anytime in the near future because of all the issues that we just talked about. We have a large number of competitors, even with the deal done. Well done, by the way. Thank you. [Competitors] who are very deep pocketed, who have decided that their primary form of competition is not going to be like building a different app or a differentiated service or a different level, it's just price. And so there are intense subsidy battles going on. All over the world. All over the world. And those companies, when they approach investors, tell them, "Uber is going to go public, and then they're going to have to be profitable, and then we're really going to sneak up on them with these discounts." While that's the game on the field, and it's one that I find to be remarkably messy and ugly, I don't think it would be in our best interest. So raising more money is the way to go. I don't know if we need to. We have $9 billion in the bank and $2 billion of debt, which is the most any private company has ever raised. Does that frighten you? Yeah, but two things. One, I do think that it is one of the best product market fits that has ever come along. And as I've come to realize what's possible here, there is a real opportunity to literally change the face of America. You talked about that early on, I remember. Like car ownership has gotten way too far in our country. 2.3 per household. I agree. And parking lots. Houston has like 4.5 parking spots per car. And there's an opportunity to change it. You can actually lower housing pricing if you remove parking requirements. So we're doing deals now with developers and getting cities to approve them to have parking-free housing. It's definitely hit into a bigger trend. A bigger, more important trend. And if you survey people, Recode had an article about a survey, and even though the Recode article was a little dismissive, it said 8 percent of the people in the survey said that ride-sharing had a strong likelihood to impact car buying decisions. That's 8 percent. This stuff only existed five years ago. Yup, it's like smartphones, early on. Yeah, what will that number be five years from now? Absolutely, I don't drive my car anymore. I think it's a leading edge. I know a ton of people who have gotten rid of their cars. Does that ruin the idea of public [transportation]? I was at a meeting the other day talking about how private transportation companies do not take the place of public transportation. I think most of the ride-sharing companies, if you look at heat maps, and they've published some of these, have huge red areas around public transportation. So most of the effective public transportation, which isn't buses, it's the subways and rails, they can't get to that last mile. And there have been studies done that suggest they're symbiotic. That they actually drive more usage of each. So let's talk about — we're going to finish up in just a minute — what else are you in now that you think is very exciting? What makes you excited? A couple. I'd probably mention three. So, Nextdoor, which is a social network for the local neighborhood that's really starting to grow. Which also has issues around racism ... They've done a really good job of addressing those in the past couple of weeks. They're trying. It's like Twitter, it's humanity, right? Absolutely. Although mine is just horrible. Is there any black person who can walk down the street that's not suspect? I'm like, "Can you stop?" Yeah, they've just come out with a whole bunch of new programs on this front. I think some of the initial people that were upset have come around and sanctioned what they're doing. So I feel good about how they've done that. Tools are important. Why do you like that one? If you go back to like 2006, the local advertising market was like 110 billion. And many of the avenues people would use to microcast advertising were radio, newspapers, magazines. They've come under threat from digital disruption, and there's not a place for people to bring that out. I also think by having a social network in the neighborhood, there's lots of features that you can implement over time. We're starting to do some of those now. And also because we're not dependent on anyone. We're not an SEO company, we didn't build on the back of Facebook Connect, we built this out ourselves. Right. It's a bulletin board. It didn't work with AOL, with Patch, which was interesting. Well, Patch is more heavily content-oriented. They did a bunch of anti-intuitive things to make the liquidity come alive. Intuitive funds were from Epinions that had built the UGC network before. I'll mention two others. Stitch Fix is just an incredible company. She's amazing. Katrina Lake's one of the best I've ever worked with. It's right here in the city, most people don't know about it. Explain it. They've built personalized women's fashion. Although they're moving into beta on men's now. And I like to think about it — no woman that's buying fashion wants to think about it this way — but I like to think about it as Moneyball for women's retail. And for every woman that comes in, they fill out a 15-page questionnaire to suss out size, fit, style, whether it's for work or social, and then for every item, we measure 66 characteristics. And then there's a data science team that's over 70 people now. In fact, Stitch Fix is the No. 1 competitor of Uber for data science talent in Silicon Valley. Eric Colson, who runs that group came from Netflix and did all the recommendation stuff there. And so when a customer comes in to ask for a new Fix, which is an interesting drug metaphor, and this package comes to them, we have a predicted keep score for every item in our inventory. Which is a level of analytics brought to this industry that's maybe one or two orders of magnitude above what everybody else is [doing]. Did you know I covered retail for seven years? And one of the companies was hot, and then it wasn't, and I went to the CEO after — it was a teen company, these things go up and down — I said, "What happened?" He goes, "Pedal pushers. I picked pedal pushers and not culottes. And that was the end of me." [laughs] I'm like, "Why?" He's like, "I just guessed." It was really funny, I'll never forget that, "pedal pushers." And that's what retail's been. We're now working with merchandisers who have ideas. And they test the ideas against the algorithm instead of ever shipping them. And so it's really cool. There's an article written on her recently called "Moneyball Fashionista" that has the whole [thing]. Huh, interesting. There's all kind of interesting experiments going on in retail. Yeah, it's really cool. All right, you get one more. What else? I'd probably talk about HackerOne. Oh, I don't know that one. So Sheryl once said that the smartest thing Facebook ever did on the security front was start a bug bounty program. And bug bounty means you basically pay the hackers to find the holes before the bad guys do. Yeah there's all kinds of crowd-sourcing on this. Yeah. Microsoft, Facebook, Mozilla, there've been people who have done this before, but they all did it kind of holistically within their own firm. Alex Rice, who worked on these programs at Facebook, created a startup that will allow anyone to have a bug bounty program. So in like 18 months, we've got over 500 customers including Priceline, Salesforce, Uber, GM, Home Depot, the Pentagon. And they're all now running bug bounty programs. And then we have a marketplace of all the hackers and all the reputations and skill sets. And it's really cool. And I think you look at the problem, huge problem, most of the solutions are defensive where you're just throwing hardware and software. And this one's offensive, right? Because you're fighting the battle in front of them. I see, interesting. It's elegant. And Mårten Mickos, who ran MySQL, is the CEO over there now. Oh, that's a really interesting company. And he's awesome. So what is overhyped? What would I say is overhyped ... You can name names. Well, some of the categories that become difficult, I would say, in this type of world, are ones where capital can create this messy playing field that I'm talking about. And one of those where I think that's happened is in the online lending space. Aha, there's a lot of those. SoFi, others. SoFi and Avant have raised a billion dollars and Lending Co. went public, and there's OnDeck and Square, and it's like, if everyone just starts aggressively giving away money, it's hard to build a business, you know? And so those are the things that get dangerous. I would say that some of the ones where we over-choreograph are difficult. Like VR, because the big guys all pull out their R&D teams and their guns, so Samsung and HTC and Facebook, they're all at the table. Most big startup breakouts are where people aren't paying attention. As opposed to where everybody's got their guns lined up. Do you like VR? I think that the screen resolution is not there yet. And a lot of the demos to get people excited are on $30, $40,000 equipment. Right, exactly. And it's hard to use. And you put on the stuff that you can buy today and it's pixelated. I had a big argument with someone about this. And so I do think there's a risk that we run into what's known as a trough of disillusionment before you get a breakout because of that. What about current companies, I'll finish up with this. Twitter. I ask everyone. You know, I'm one of the biggest optimists about what's possible out of Twitter. Most people feel that way. Primarily because the most important people in the world are curating their persona there. And you can get them to do more work than they're already doing today. Yeah, it was interesting, because Mike McCue is a former board member who is running for the board. He said it's a bigger phenomenon than it is a company. Look, it may be. I think running businesses at scale is probably the most underrated activity in Silicon Valley relative to how hard it is, you know. How hard it is? I know you guys are all like, "It's so hard." I'm like, "I thought you're the smartest people on earth." Fair enough. I don't really care because you're all rich and smart. Fair enough, but what [John] Donahoe did at eBay is really really hard. And most entrepreneurs like to take potshots at big companies in a way that I think is disrespectful. What do you imagine will happen to it, then? There's always a chance that there's a sale process. I guess Ev [Williams] was rumored in the press yesterday talking about that. I think there's a lot of opportunity to kind of micro-segment around interest groups, because today the way the feed's oriented. If I love all country music, which I do — Me too. — if Ryan Adams happens to say something at the right time, I find it. I thought you could mine the feed and build a Techmeme for everything. And so there could be an alt-country newspaper that it’s pulling from, and you have a ranking table. I've talked to Jack [Dorsey] and the team about it. I hope one day they do it. I think it could lead to something. What happens to these companies? I think the problem is a smallish company gets a lot of attention because of journalists, and then it's sort of a narrative, the way Yahoo became. Yup. It's possible. And it gets sucked up into that. Yeah. It's possible, you know. There's a lot of heat, pressure. What is a mistake that you've made and learned from, as a venture capitalist or investor, anything. You talked about being too analytical and missing some of the instinctual stuff. Is there anything you did that you're like, "Oh I shoulda done it this way?" Or what do you tell entrepreneurs? The immediate thing that comes to my mind was the Google investment, because you can't make a bigger mistake. I was trying to think of another one since we already talked about that. That's a big one. But what went on there as an investor? As I mentioned, some of the external data points lead you to have some amount of skepticism. The product usage was already starting to happen. We were all using it in our office. It was a better product, so we can't blame that. And we were already talking about, "Oh you just do what GoTo did." So the business motto really wasn't a question either. Everyone was already saying that. I think it came down to the price at the time was remarkably high, and the team was remarkably self-confident in a way that would cause you to question whether they could pull it off. But they did. And I go back, I think the learning is that if you have remarkably asymmetric returns, you have to ask yourself, "How high could up be?" And then that "what could go right?" question. Because it's not a 50/50 thing on the judgment call. Like, if you thought it was a 20 percent chance at doing it, you should still do it, because the upside is so high. Right. What do you want to invest in? What interests you a great deal now? Like AI, everyone's either terrified with it or thrilled with it. I've been spending a lot of time looking at the health care space. Ah, you're going to wade in there. Well, I look at the technologies, I look at the smartphone, I look at what we've done with UGC plays, I look at what we've done even with Zillow and real estate. And I say, "Boy, this thing's really messed up, we ought to be able to fix it." Now, my first two years of looking at stuff has caused me to step back a little bit because it is atrociously complex. And the way that regulation works, the way that the payers, the company who doesn't even really want to be in the process ... They've made quite a thicket, haven't they? Oh, it's so messed up. There are some little signs of seedlings that it could become more of a payer situation. And we're an investor in One Medical, which I think is exploiting this. Like, "The customer wants to be treated like a customer, and they haven't been in this space." And if you implement something where they feel that way ... Well, you endure a lot. Oh god, it's ridiculous. It's so ridiculous. So health care. Anywhere else? AI? Yeah, we look at that kind of stuff. I tend to like the stuff that's applied in machine learning and AI, like a Stitch Fix, rather than building something to sell to somebody. The things that Amazon is doing in both e-tailing and AWS causes you to rewrite your entire rule set. And it is changing so fast that almost everything we've done in the past, we've got to reconsider. All right, last question. Are we in a bubble, Mr. Gurley? Mr. Anti-bubble? Are we in a bub-bull? I think certainly we have taken on more risk than we realize and there will be consequences of that. Because there's so much money in these things, nothing goes away overnight. And a few very well-known companies have already been recap, which means that the investors that were on the cap chartered zero. And you don't see that. The thing is still bumbling along. I'd like to see that, you can send me those. But I think there'll be more of that over time. More of that. And sales, too. Yup. And see the sales of things as they go, like LinkedIn and others. I think those are the signs of something profound. Yeah, I think those happen because, well, two things. I think when the markets stop going only up and to the right — prior to that, a lot of the unicorn entrepreneurs were thinking infinity is the top, and so all of a sudden you shake that a little bit and they get a little more reality. And the you might be able to bridge a bit with an acquire. So Bill Gurley's still worried? I am. But maybe that's my universal state. Yeah, I think it is. All right, Bill, thank you so much for coming. No problem, thanks for having me. recode_divider More From Recode Here’s the secret to Starry Internet’s plan to beam the internet to your house and break up the broadband monopoly Full transcript: Recode’s April Glaser talks drones on Too Embarrassed to Ask Recode Daily: Fake Facebook news is a danger to democracy, says Obama Do 'productivity hacks' really help you get stuff done?

The top three players accounted for 48.69% of the market in 2014. Google Inc. has surpassed the competition thanks largely to the expansion of their product line through product innovation and acquisitions, according to a new report by Transparency Market Research (TMR). A similar strategy is also being followed by IBM Corp., which has broadened its interests in the IoT field by acquiring Phytel to enhance the effectiveness and quality of personal healthcare. Apple Inc. is striving to extend its business through product enhancements. In June 2015, the company introduced a new version of OS X, which enhances the system performance and Mac experience.  According to the report, the global IoT market is expected to be worth $924.86 billion by 2021. On the basis of application, the industrial segment led in the past and will continue to be in a dominant position, accounting for 23.40% of the market in 2021. By geography, North America is anticipated to lead the global IoT market and account for 37.45% of global revenues by 2021. On the basis of technology, the Wi-Fi segment will continue to lead, accounting for 32.56% of the market in 2021. Technological advancements in the field of healthcare are an important driver for the IoT market. IoT is proving effective in enhancing the efficiency of the healthcare system and in reducing the cost incurred for patients. IoT also has the potential to cover economic expansionary phases and thus, governments across countries are investing heavily in IoT to enhance the comfort, convenience, and management of patients as well as healthcare service providers. This is improving the quality of life of people and thus, IoT will continue to remain in demand. IoT helps in achieving machine to machine communication and offers more efficiency and accurate results. Thus, optimal utilization of energy and resources can be achieved with the adoption of IoT. Additionally, costs can be saved through proactive maintenance programs which make use of IoT, thus driving their demand further. Security risks to pose a challenge Internet of Things devices can expose consumers to various security risks by allowing unauthorized access to a third person who could misuse sensitive personal information. Thus, there are many possibilities of vulnerabilities which can increase owing to the use of IoT. Moreover, a connected smart device may also be used to send malicious emails. However, with advancements in technology, the impact of this restraint is expected to reduce in the coming years. Over dependence on the IoT is another factor restraining the growth of the market. Minor glitches of a few seconds in IoT can ruin the entire process and cause several problems. For instance, if glitches were to occur in sensors in a car, the system could fail to provide vital information to a driver, possibly leading to an accident.  In the future, it is expected that an increasing number of devices such as televisions, cars, and refrigerators, among others, will make use of IoT and become smarter. These devices are expected not only to be equipped with sensors but also have internet connectivity for communication. This will help alert the user to a critical information. TMR predicts that the demand for IoT will increase significantly, driving the market towards tremendous growth.

For instance, if glitches were to occur in sensors in a car, the system could fail to provide vital information to a driver, possibly leading to an accident.  In the future, it is expected that an increasing number of devices such as televisions, cars, and refrigerators, among others, will make use of IoT and become smarter. These devices are expected not only to be equipped with sensors but also have internet connectivity for communication. This will help alert the user to a critical information. TMR predicts that the demand for IoT will increase significantly, driving the market towards tremendous growth.

By Jason Cipriani | October 3, 2016 -- 20:59 GMT (13:59 PDT) | Topic: Google Google's Daydream VR headset will cost $79. Google on Tuesday is expected to announce a healthy list of hardware products at an event in San Francisco, Calif. From two Pixel (not Nexus) smartphones to a Google Wi-Fi router, Google Home personal assistant, and 4K Chromecast devices, Google is also expected to announce its first Daydream virtual-reality headset. According to a report from Variety, Google's Daydream VR headset will cost $79. Also worth noting is the headset will reportedly be manufactured by HTC, the same company rumored as the manufacturer of the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Now, before you get too excited, keep in mind that price is in addition to the cost of the Pixel or Pixel XL smartphone required to use the headset. They'll presumably be the first two devices available with support for Google's Daydream VR platform.

Amazon Echo and Google Home: Where the real battleground lies Google destroys the Android fan myth that the iPhone is too expensive Daydream View VR headset available in November for $79 Google Home will sell for $129, launch partners include Nest, IFTTT Google Wifi aims to improve your home's wireless network Why pay a premium when every phone runs the same apps? Still, Google's Daydream platform will lower the barrier for those who want to experience virtual reality without purchasing a powerful gaming PC often required to run the HTC Vive or Oculus' VR dedicated headset. Google first unveiled Daydream during Google I/O, its developer conference, in May 2016. The Daydream platform is built directly into Android 7.0 Nougat and will allow Android developers to build immersive apps and games. Google's approach to VR with Daydream is similar to Samsung's Gear VR line, wherein a user places a compatible smartphone into a headset. The phone provides the display and computing power to drive the virtual-reality experience. Google is also requiring a handheld controller to move and interact within a virtual-reality app or experience, unlike Samsung's Gear VR headset, which relies on a trackpad on the side of the headset for interaction. Google created a set of requirements, including specifications such as processor speed and display quality, which a device manufacturer must meet in order for a phone to be certified "Daydream-ready". ZTE's Axon 7, for example, is Daydream-ready and priced at just $399. We will have a full report of everything announced during Google's hardware event, which kicks off Oct. 4 at 12 pm ET.

Unless you’re a huge Android and Google Nexus phone fan, you’ve probably wondered what all the hullabaloo is about. The long and short of it is that Google is about to launch two new smartphones on October 4. However, we’ll have to start at the beginning of the story to explain why you should be excited about Google’s new phones. The story takes us back to January 2010, when the first Google Nexus smartphone ever debuted. What’s a Nexus? It’s an Android phone made through a collaboration between Google and another popular smartphone manufacturer. You see, Google owns Android and it’s an open-source operating system, meaning any manufacturer is free to use it. It’s the big reason why it’s the most widely-used mobile operating system in the world. Related: Google’s Pixel phones get more details, fun color names ahead of launch But smartphone manufacturers wanted to make Android their own, and they did so with “skins.” These are essentially themes that change the look of Android. Samsung’s skin is called TouchWiz, HTC has Sense, LG has UX, and so on. Rumors suggest Google is replacing the Nexus phone lineup with the Pixel brand name The Nexus program is Google’s way of offering a “stock,” or pure version of Android to users. Straight from the search giant, Nexus smartphones and tablets came with a few pre-installed Google apps, but the main promise of the phones is fast updates. With so many variants of Android skins and smartphones, it’s difficult to force manufacturers and carriers to update devices to newer versions of Android in a timely fashion. With the Nexus program, Google didn’t have to deal with anyone else and could push the updates straight to the smartphones as soon as builds were ready — just like Apple does with iOS. The Nexus smartphones were never heavily marketed towards the average consumer. That’s changing this year, if you can’t tell by the sudden ramp in advertising from Google for its October 4 launch event. Rumors suggest the search giant is replacing the Nexus phone lineup with the Pixel brand name. Related: Hands-on: Google Allo It’s all under Google’s new vision to sell itself as a hardware company, under a snappy “made by Google” slogan. We’re expecting to see Pixel-branded smartphones, Google Home, a new Chromecast, Daydream VR, and more at the upcoming event. We can’t verify whether or not Google is retiring the Nexus name — and some rumors suggest Google may yet hold on to the brand for a Huawei-made tablet. Still, if Nexus is folding, let’s take a look at the company’s 14 devices, ever since it started the program six years ago. Nexus One (2010) Google’s first Nexus smartphone, the Nexus One, was developed in close partnership with HTC. The One had a 3.7-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 800 x 480-pixels. It was powered by a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage, as well as MicroSD card support. Its rear camera was the only camera, and it had 5-megapixels and a LED flash. While the device had a touchscreen with off-screen buttons, it featured a trackball that doubled as a color-changing notification light. The smartphone launched with Android 2.1 Eclair, and the last flavor it tasted was Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread. Nexus S (2010) Hot on the heels of releasing the Nexus One, Google partnered up with Samsung for the Nexus S. It was released toward the end of the year, and was the first smartphone to showcase Android 2.3 Gingerbread. The 4-inch device had a Super AMOLED screen with a resolution of 800 x 480-pixels. Its internals were akin to Samsung’s Galaxy S — it was powered by the Korean giant’s Exynos 3110 processor, had 512MB of RAM, and packed 16GB of internal storage. The Nexus S was one of the first smartphones to have a slightly curved glass touchscreen, and it was also one of the first Android smartphones to come with a near-field communication chip — the technology that enables frameworks like Android Pay and Apple Pay. The last version update the Nexus S received was Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. In our review, we gave the Nexus S a 7.5 out of 10. Galaxy Nexus (2011) Google stuck with Samsung for a second year to produce the Galaxy Nexus. Noticeably, the biggest change was the lack of physical navigation buttons — on-screen buttons were introduced in the new Android version, 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. The smartphone’s 4.65-inch Super AMOLED screen had a resolution of 1280 x 720-pixels, and it was powered by a dual-core processor from Texas Instruments, with 1GB of RAM. The Galaxy Nexus came with 16 and 32GB internal storage options and had a 1,750mAh battery. It sported a 5-megapixel rear camera, as well as a 1.3-megapixel front one — it could even film videos in 1080p. The phone was among the first to support Google Wallet, and the last version it received was Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. In our review, we gave the Galaxy Nexus a 9 out of 10. Nexus 7 (2012) The year 2012 was a busy one for Google — the company unveiled four Android devices, two of which were tablets. The smaller, Asus-built Nexus 7 was a hit thanks to its low $200 price tag and high-end build. It introduced Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, meaning it was one of the first devices to come shipped with Google Now. The 7-inch slate was powered by Nvidia’s quad-core Tegra 3 processor and 1GB of RAM. The tablet offered internal storage options of 8, 16, and 32GB, and also featured NFC. It was the first device to market the rebranded app store, Google Play. The last version update the tablet received was Android 5.1 Lollipop. In our review, we gave the Nexus 7 a 9 out of 10. Nexus Q (2012) A precursor to the Chromecast and the Nexus Player, Google debuted the oddball Nexus Q in 2012 to challenge Apple TV. The device was a flop, though, thanks to its high price tag for what it does. The device connected to speakers and TVs, and users could cast content from Google services like YouTube and Google Play Movies. Third-party support was not offered, which is another reason the device saw its quick demise. Nexus 10 (2012) The Nexus 10 was another Samsung-made device, and like its name suggests, it featured a 10-inch display. But what made the Nexus 10 stand out was its resolution — it was the first tablet to carry a high-resolution of 2,560 x 1600 pixels. While the Nexus 7 debuted earlier in the year, the Nexus 10 came alongside the Nexus 4 with Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. An event scheduled to showcase the Nexus 4 and 10 and Android 4.2 was canceled due to Hurricane Sandy, and after the tablet was released, it was consistently out of stock due to high demand. The Nexus 10 was powered by Samsung’s Exynos 5250 with 2GB of RAM. It does not have a MicroSD card slot, but offered storage space options of 16 or 32GB. The last version update it received was Android 5.1 Lollipop. In our review, we gave the Nexus 10 an 8.5 our of 10. Nexus 4 (2012) Google went with a new partner for the Nexus 4 — LG. The smartphone ran Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, and introduced Photo Sphere in the Google Camera app — this allowed users to take 360-degree photos of their surroundings. The Nexus 4 has a unique design thanks to its glass back with a spotted pattern. The 4.7-inch smartphone has a resolution of 1,280 x 768-pixels, and was packed with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB of RAM, a 2,100mAh battery, and 8 or 16GB internal storage options. Its rear camera carried 8-megapixels, whereas the front only had 1.3. It was rated positively thanks to its low-price and high-end specs. The last version update the Nexus 4 received was Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. In our review, we gave the Nexus 4 an 8.5 out of 10. Next Page 1 of 2 Page 1 Page 2

Elyse Betters4 October 2016Phones Google Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google's "Made by Google" event received a lot of hype and anticipation as it promised more than just a new product launch. It was in fact Google's chance to rebrand and reposition itself a serious contender in the consumer electronics space and to show it can compete on hardware as well as software. We expected to see a couple of new Pixel smartphones to replace the outgoing Nexus brand, more information on the company's Daydream virtual reality headset, a new Chromecast streaming dongle, Google Home wireless speaker with the Google Assistant built in, and Google's answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Wi-Fi.  Suffice to say, we got all that, and there was a lot to take in. Fortunately for you, we've rounded up everything that was announced on this page, but if you want to watch the keynote speech again for yourself, you can do. What is "Made by Google" about? Google advertised its 4 October event under the tagline "Made by Google". It's to show that Google is ditching the Nexus brand for its flagship smartphones and that it wants to place greater emphasis on hardware. Up until now, Google has sourced third-party manufacturers to make most of its products, for it to then install its software. What Google now wants to do is have more of an input into the hardware itself so it can fully optimise it to work with its software.  Where can I watch the Made by Google event livestream? The livestream started at 5pm UK time and finished at around 6.30pm. If you want to watch it all again to see Google representatives show how to use all the products and software announced, you can do so on YouTube or by clicking play on the video below. Google has also launched a new website specifically for the event. What did Google launch at the Made by Google event? Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones Bell Google unsurprisingly launched two new smartphones at the event: the Pixel and Pixel XL. The two phones were subject to numerous leaks in the days, weeks and months leading up to the event, so we already had a good idea of what to expect. Needless to say, both Pixel smartphones look incredible and we can't wait to get them in for review. The Pixel is the smaller of the two smartphones, with a 5in full HD AMOLED display with 441ppi (pixels per inch), while the Pixel XL gets a 5.5in 2560x1440 Quad HD display with 534ppi. Both screens are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and both get treated to full metal bodies with a glass panel covering the top third of the rear. This glass panel is where you'll find a fingerprint scanner. Both phones come with a 12-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and 4K video support and an 8MP snapper on the front. They'll both be available in three colours: Quite Black, Very Silver and Really Blue. The Pixel has a starting price of £599 while the Pixel XL will be more expensive, starting at £719. Both will be released on October 20. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Everything you need to know Google Daydream Google As well as outline its Daydream virtual reality platform in more detail than before, Google unveiled its own VR headset due for release in November. Google Daydream View is a similar device to other mobile headsets in that it houses a phone, but will only work with Daydream-ready handsets. At present that's just the Pixel and Pixel XL. It also differs from peers in that it is covered in material, not just plastic, for a more comfortable, less geeky feel. Whether that comes across is debateable as, from where we're standing, it looks a bit like a pair of socks, but at least it is different. The headset and dedicated remote control will retail for £69 in the UK, $79 in the US when they are available next month. The Daydream platform will also be adopted by other manufacturers when they introduce compatible handsets, so you will be able to find VR content more easily than before. Apps and videos will be available through a one-stop, dedicated hub. What is Google Daydream and when is it coming? 4K Chromecast Ultra VentureBeat With 4K video hitting the headlines it made sense for Google to jump on the bandwagon with a 4K Ultra HD-ready version of its Chromecast streaming dongle. What's more, it announced that there will be movies on its Google Play store that are in 4K to view on it. The Chromecast Ultra, which looks like the current Chromecast 2, will also stream UHD content with HDR and even Dolby Vision picture tech if needed. And other content providers' 4K videos will be compatible too. It'll be available from November in the States for $69. Current thinking is that it'll cost £69 in the UK, but might be a little lower. Google 4K Chromecast Ultra: Everything you need to know Google Home Google Google announced an Amazon Echo-like device called Google Home in May, and then at its Made by Google event, it announced when you would be able to get your hands on the speaker. Google Home is a Wi-Fi enabled, voice-activated speaker that works as a smarthome control centre and an assistant for the whole family. You can use it to play entertainment throughout your entire house, manage every-day tasks, and ask Google what you want to know. Google Home also acts as a Chromecast Audio receiver. The device itself has interchangeable bases available in various colours and finishes. Underneath that swappable shell there is a speaker that can playback songs and allow Google Assistant to talk to you. The speaker features dual side-facing passive radiators, which deliver full range, clear highs, and rich bass. At the top of the device there is a capacitive touch display with four LEDs. You'll use this interact with Home, like trigger the Assistant, adjust volume, etc. As for buttons, there are none at the top (just dual mics that listen for your voice). There is a single mute button on the shell. Google Home is able to filter and separate speech from noise and offers "best-in-class voice recognition", according to Google. A big part of Google Home is going to be Google Assistant that powers it. Like Amazon's Echo, it's going to offer a full range of services all powered by your voice and connected into a range of other services and devices. At launch, Google Home works with Nest, SmartThings, Philips Hue, IFTTT, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music, TuneIn, and iHeart Radio. Google Home is now available for pre-order in the US for $129. It will be in stores on 4 November. It's coming soon to the UK, Google told Pocket-lint, but it's not yet available to pre-order in the country. What is Google Home, how does it work, and when can you buy it? Google Wi-Fi Google Google has announced a new Wi-Fi router at its Made by Google event. Last year, Google introduced the OnHub router with TP-Link and Asus, but this year, Google has made its own device called Google Wi-Fi. Each base station looks like a Scandinavian-style, double-stacked hockey puck that Google described as a "visually subtle" disk. You can buy multiple routers to form a mesh network. You basically put several of these disks around your home to boost your network, allowing you to get Wi-Fi signal everywhere, from your bathroom to your basement. Think of Google Wi-Fi as an expandable system for better coverage. Instead of one router, multiple routers work together to deliver fast input to throughout your home, Google said. It's basically a modular system. Google Wi-Fi has a feature called Network Assist that allows it to actively manage and optimise your network behind the scenes so you don't have to adjust settings. Google Wi-Fi handles networking automatically, picking channels, etc, and it keeps the signal strong in every corner of your house by transitioning your device to the best router for less congestion and better speed. Google Wi-Fi will be available for pre-order in November in the US. It costs $129 for one base station or $299 for three and should ship in December. It won't be coming to the UK for now, but Google said it “hopes to make it available in the future". Google Wi-Fi router announced, pre-orders start in November Google Andromeda Android Police The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Google is attempting to fold Chrome OS into Android. Engineers at Google have reportedly been trying to combine the two systems over the past three years, with the goal of unveiling a single, unified operating system by 2017. Google 'Pixel 3' laptop running Andromeda OS planned for 2017 For instance, more recently, Android Police claimed Google will release a Bison/Pixel 3 convertible laptop in Q3 2017, while 9to5Google said a Nexus-branded, 7-inch tablet made by Huawei will arrive by the end of 2016. Both these devices will run a new OS called Andromeda, which is thought to be the name of Google's hybrid Android/Chrome OS. What is Google Andromeda? We expected to hear more about Andromeda at Google's event but sadly this wasn't the case. If rumours about devices running the new OS are true, we could see a separate event later in the year.

The company added some new apps infused with artificial intelligence to the mix. Quick Access in Google Drive on Android, for example, makes the files most relevant to a user's work accessible when Drive is opened. It cuts the time spent finding a file by about half, noted Prabhakar Raghavan, vice president for apps at Google Cloud Research. Machine intelligence also is incorporated into Google Calendar to help users allocate meeting times based on attendees' schedules, and to suggest available rooms based on previous bookings. Explore in Google Sheets uses natural language processing to translate users' questions into formulas and offer an instant answer. Previously, users had to write the formulas. Explore in Google Docs, another new G Suite feature, uses machine intelligence to make automatic recommendations of related topics to look up, images to insert, and additional content to discover. It's also useful for finding related documents in Google Drive. Another new G Suite app, Explore in Google Slides, dynamically offers suggestions for the layout of slides for presentations, saving more than 30 percent of the time spent on formatting, Raghavan said. The Team Drives capability lets teams share Google Drive storage. It helps with onboarding and offboarding of team members, retaining work done in the latter case. It lets team members share content ownership. Google previewed Team Drives with a few customers prior to launching the Early Adopter Program. Google also previewed Meetings for Teams with a few customers, and it too is available through an Early Adopter Program. It generates a short link and dial-in phone number for every meeting. Attendees can join from any device, even without an account or data connection. There are no downloads or browser plug-ins. Meetings for Teams can handle up to 50 video participants. It provides seamless integration into Google Calendar and offers instant screen sharing. The Enterprise Equation "The level of automation via AI is minimal," said Alan Lepofsky, a principal analyst at Constellation Research, but that is likely to change in future G Suite releases. "I would like to see more of Google Now-type functionality worked in, showing people the areas they should be focusing on at work as well as the things they can deprioritize," he told the E-Commerce Times. There's "nothing completely new about G Suite that would require additional training," Lepofsky noted. "Companies that currently use Google Apps for Work will be pleased with the updates that come with G Suite." New customers comfortable with a cloud-only solution "will find it very easy to get started," he added. Cutting deeper inroads into businesses might be where G Suite hits some roadblocks. "The biggest challenge for Google is in proving itself as a company that has enterprises as its focus when its portfolio and other range of investments suggests otherwise," pointed out Rebecca Wettemann, VP of research at Nucleus Research. "Google has taken a number of swings at the enterprise in past years, only to be quickly distracted by other projects with a clearly non-enterprise focus -- like YouTube," she told the E-Commerce Times. The Bigger Picture Microsoft recently announced it was infusing AI into its Office Suite, with new capabilities such as Tap for Word and Outlook. It also introduced a new group that includes its Bing and Cortana products in order to help infuse AI through its infrastructure, services, apps and agents. Microsoft currently is ahead in office apps. Further, "the first release of G Suite isn't showing the levels of AI integration that Microsoft showed at Ignite for Office 365," observed Lepofsky. Many vendors are investing significant sums to bring AI into their apps and productivity tools, Wettemann noted, so "simply putting AI into Google won't make its apps business more compelling to business decision makers." Personal productivity tools like Apps or Microsoft Office "have a broad reach across the organization," and adoption can be highly disruptive, she said. Companies considering G Suite "will need to see a professional approach to product road maps and releases, support and adoption efforts, to say the least."

We'll see grave environmental damage instead of progress. Fear of negative consequences will spur more positive actions. Trump probably will come around to a more moderate position.

Google Pixel phones, Daydream View and Chromecast Ultra: Everything Google just announced 0 Share: Phones by Lori Grunin October 4, 2016 10:39 AM PDT @LoriGrunin Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy With Pixel and Home, Google gets serious about hardware Google wants to rule your pocket and your living room with a suite of new gadgets, stuffed with the improved Google Assistant. Bridget Carey rounds up all the company's newly announced gadgets and discusses how Google is targeting Apple and Amazon. by Bridget Carey 2:47 Close Drag It feels like forever since the first rumors about Google's announcements for this event started cropping up, but now we can finally lay at least some of them to rest. Just joining us? Here's what you've missed thus far. The event opened with a cute video by the characters of HBO's "Silicon Valley." "Why wasn't I on the beta?!" That was followed by a summary by Sundar Pichai of computing since the first PC. "We're moving from a mobile first to an AI first" world." That means Google Assistant, announced at the Google I/O conference in May, with its voice queries, contextually relevant information and so on -- much like the most current version of Apple's Siri. Cue pitch about all Google's ongoing work in machine-learning-related tech. 35 Google's Pixel hardware event Going further requires getting it in the hands of users to see how they really interact, which it began with the release of Google Allo. Now Google Assistant comes to your phone and home. Rick Osterloh of the company's new Hardware group took the stage to explain how Google is well situated to meld hardware and software. A new family of home grown devices is the result. Hands-on with Google's Pixel and Pixel XL phones Lexy Savvides checks out Google's new Pixel and Pixel XL, both of which boast the Snapdragon 821 processor and sport a 12-megapixel camera. by Lexy Savvides 2:03 Close Drag First up, the phone: it's dubbed Pixel, which comes as a surprise to no one. There's a new material design with rounded icons and Google Assistant right on the home screen (where you probably can't get rid of it). In addition to being shiny, the phone includes: Google Assistant The camera, which it claims is the best ever. As you might expect from Google, its camera incorporates a lot more computational photography than most, such as a burst-shooting best-shot chooser (Smart Burst); HDR+, which works in any light and uses multiple short exposures for better exposures and has "zero" shutter lag and fast processing; and better-than-average digital stabilization. (We have a lot more details about the Pixel camera.) Unlimited Google Photos storage. Google Duo, the company's video calling app announced at Google I/O. Up to 7 hours of battery life on 15 minutes of charging. Android 7, Nougat. It automatically downloads and installs updates in the background. (I hope you can turn that off.) It has built in Google support chatting. Plus easy migration from iPhone! A new line of cases with photos. It comes in two sizes, 5 inches and 5.5 inches. They have the same hardware specs. They start at $649, AU$1,079 or £599, and are available for preorder in the US, Australia and the UK. Daydream View: Google's new VR viewer Google's new VR viewer is made from soft fabric for comfort and includes a touch-sensitive controller. 2:26 Close Drag Then Google moved on to virtual reality, with its new Daydream View headset. The platform was announced at Google I/O in May, a programming interface combining software, phone hardware and headsets. Today the company rolled out the first Daydream-compatible VR headset, the Daydream View, and a reasonably priced one at that: $79, £69 or AU$119 converted. Highlights: It uses a fabric cover for looks and comfort, it's 30 percent lighter than most headsets, comes in slate, snow and crimson colors and can fit over eyeglasses. Your phone drops in, auto aligns and auto connects. The controller has built in gyros sensitive enough for drawing, and it fits into the phone slot when not in use so you don't lose it. New Daydream apps include a "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" tie-in wand game; Star Chart, an educational astronomy app; a first-person space shooter game; movies in VR from the major streaming sites; and more. Google Play Movies, Google Photos, Street View, Maps and YouTube will have immersive Daydream support. It will be available in November. 12 Google Daydream is VR for everyone (pictures) Homeward bound. We weren't terribly thrilled by Google's OnHub router, which debuted about a year ago, but it's now turned into Google Wifi. It's modular, can work as a mesh in your home with multiple access points, and has built-in smarts to optimize the signal strength as you roam through your house. You can turn it off remotely, as well. Preorders start in November, but in the US only. It ships in December and will cost $130 for a single, or $300 for a three-pack. Playing catch-up with others in the crowded video streamer space, Google added 4K UHD support with HDR and Dolby Vision to its new higher-end Chromecast Ultra, for a not-terribly-onerous $69, £69 or AU$99. It's available in the US, UK and Australia. Google Play Videos will have content for it, it's faster than before with better Wi-Fi support and it now has an Ethernet port. 13 Smart speaker showdown? Google Home braces for battle with Amazon's Alexa First revealed in May 2016 at Google I/O, the company's developer conference, this virtual-assistant competitor for Amazon Echo finally arrives. Google Home incorporates all the features of Google Assistant, plus smart home controls. The microphones are optimized for better voice recognition, there's a way to turn the mic off, you can swap bases and Google says the speakers are great. Google Assistant features include intelligent voice-activated music-streaming playback, get answers to lots of questions, get traffic info and translations, summarizes information you need for your day (such as tasks and weather) and more. Partnerships with IFTTT, Samsung, Philips and Nest will allow Google Home to control home electronics. It can play and control media on TVs and home audio systems using Google Cast (Netflix will support voice control), and it's smarter about using multiple Home devices. Google Home will cost $130 -- with a free six-month trial of YouTube Red, the video site's ad-free service. You can preorder now and it will ship on November 4. It's US-only for now. A new Actions programming interface for Google Assistant will let third-party software developers access it to perform conversation-based app-specific operations and direct "do it" actions. There's a new embedded Google Assistant SDK for next year, so developers can embed the capabilities in their apps. And that's all, folks!

In the meantime, there will be no changes for current Webpass or Google Fiber customers, who will continue to get the same great services they love.”   He reiterated that Google Fiber’s “strategy going forward will be a hybrid approach with wireless playing an integral part,” noting that point-to-point wireless has shown to be reliable way to deliver high-speed services in high density environments.   Google has asked the FCC for permission to move ahead with plans to trial wireless broadband in as many as 24 U.S. locations, including New York City, Chicago and Atlanta.   Of recent note on the wired side, Google Fiber has opened up the sign-up process in the North Carolina “Triangle” area, starting in Morrisville.   Want to read more stories like this?

Heads up, business folk: Google today made a slew of work-focused announcements spanning its cloud, apps, and technical infrastructure solutions. For starters, Google's cloud platform—"our user facing collaboration and productivity applications"—is now known as Google Cloud. It encompasses all the company's cloud technologies and products: its "user-facing collaboration and productivity applications" (think, Gmail and Docs); machine learning tools and APIs; enterprise maps APIs; and all Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks that access the cloud. //Related Articles Business Choice Awards 2016: Cloud Computing Services Apps for Work, meanwhile, is also getting a new name: G Suite. And what's a new name without some new features? Docs, Sheets, and Slides now support Explore, which will deliver "insights, design tools and research recommendations so you can create better work, faster." A new Drive feature called Quick Access also aims to save you time by using machine learning to "intelligently predict the files you need before you've even typed anything." Finally, Google is rolling out its "Find and time" feature, already available on Android, to Calendar on iOS. On top of that, Google also today announced new cloud technologies and machine intelligence capabilities, along with eight new Cloud Platform locations: Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland, and Frankfurt.

Per TechCrunch, Google will put a $129 price tag on Google Home.   Also expected is a 4K upgrade to the Chromecast streaming adapter with a reported price of $69, about double the cost of the current-gen Chromecast introduced about a year ago. The image above is  purported to be the new Chromecast.    Google announced Daydream VR, its Android-based mobile virtual reality platform, in May, and is reportedly set to announce shed light on more detail, including the first Daydream headset and controller. Bloomberg said earlier that Google’s been lining up talent and apps partners in preparation for the debut.   Google’s also said to be teeing up a new whole-home WiFi platform that relies on multiple access points and a mesh-based system.    RELATED: Frontier, AirTies Make Home WiFi Connection   While these products/systems have been making inroads at retail, they are also becoming an increasingly important product for cable operators and other broadband service providers.    UPDATE: The leaks were very accurate.

It’s the first phone to have Google’s “Assistant” built in, Osterloh said. “We’re building hardware with Google Assistant at its core so you can get things done without worrying about the underlying technology.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that as Google advances its work, the assistant will improve. “Assistant will continuously get better as we make progress with machine learning and AI,” Pichai said. Added Google’s head of software management for Pixel, Brian Rakowski, “The assistant is incredibly useful when it’s built right into your phone. Whether you’re in the homescreen or any app you can always ask the Assistant for information.” Rakowski said the Pixel’s 12.3 camera was rated as the best ever for a smartphone. It’s integrated with Google photos, and Pixel owners get unlimited, full-resolution photo and video storage in the Google Cloud. The Pixel phone comes in two sizes: a five-inch display, and a five-and-a-half-inch version. Pixel will run Google’s Nougat operating system. The battery can charge quickly, said Sabrina Ellis, from the Pixel product management team. “Pixel can get you up to 7 hours of power with just 15 minutes of charging,” Ellis said. Google’s Daydream virtual-reality system comes built-in. The firm unveiled its Daydream VR headset Tuesday. Starting Tuesday, the Pixel phones can be pre-ordered through the Google Store, Verizon stores or Best Buy, and buyers will receive them by Oct. 20, when retail sales start. Only phones pre-ordered or bought in the Google Store are unlocked to accept various SIM cards. Phones purchased at Verizon stores or Best Buy are locked to Verizon as a carrier. The Pixel’s price starts at $649. The Pixel comes in “Quite black,” “Very Silver,” and a limited edition “Really Blue.” Also Tuesday, Google announced a new, modular home wifi router system, intended to allow users to deploy multiple devices to cover all areas of a home. “Traditional routers weren’t designed for the way we use wifi in the home today: we’re streaming, gaming, video chatting all throughout the house,” said Mario Queiroz, leader of Google’s hardware product management group. Pre-orders for Google WiFi start in November, and the devices will ship in December, Queiroz said. It costs $129, or three for $299. Google’s Chromecast streaming device, which has sold 30 million units, has been upgraded to “Chromecast Ultra,” compatible with 4K video, Google announced. At $69, the devices will be available in November. Perhaps the most eagerly awaited new Google product is the Google Home virtual-assistance device that the firm announced in May at its developers conference. On Tuesday, the company revealed more about what Home, which contains Google’s “Assistant,” and is voice controlled, providing computer-voice answers. Google has entered partnerships with Samsung, Philips, and Nest so people can use Home to control home devices, and will continue to add partners, said Google’s vice-president of product management Rishi Chandra. “We want to make sure we support as many home devices as possible,” Chandra said. The device can also answer questions, play music and TVs, and put photos up on the TV, Chandra said. Google has created “MyDay,” which lets users hear important daily information such as weather, traffic and their appointments, Chandra said. Pre-orders for the $129 Home device start Tuesday in the Google Store, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, and it will ship and become available in retail stores Nov. 4, Chandra said.

Google is facing criticism from within today following news that the company invited a prominent anti-gay activist to attend a Mountain View tech conference this Friday. What's more, The Guardian reports that Google went so far as to sponsor his visa — a move that has understandably rankled some of the tech giant's LGBTQ employees. Ezekiel Mutua is the head of the Kenyan film classification board, and in that capacity has repeatedly condemned homosexuality and worked to ban music and film that depict it. “Kenya must not allow people to become the Sodom and Gomorrah through psychological drive from such content,” he told Mamba Online in reference to a cover of the Macklemore song "Same Love" which addressed the queer community in Kenya. In a country where homosexuality is punishable by up to 14 years in prison Mutua's words carry weight, and the KFCB outlawed the music video in question. This is just one of many incidents involving Mutua's condemnation of homosexuality, and a person familiar with the matter told the Guardian that some Google employees are upset the company invited Mutua to attend the upcoming Web Rangers conference in Mountain View. Mutua, for his part, was all bluster about the matter — bragging in a now-deleted Facebook post that he got approval to attend the conference despite his anti-gay stance. "Because of my stand on moral values, including the banning of content promoting LGBT and atheists culture in Kenya, someone wrote in a local daily that I will never get a visa to the US,” he wrote. “Well, I not only got it but it came on a diplomatic passport and I didn’t even have to go to the embassy for biometrics or pay the visa application fee." However, despite Google's support, his celebration may have been a bit too hasty. Although he is already in the US, Standard Digital reports that the Kenyan Department of Immigration issued an order to revoke his diplomatic passport — saying he no longer qualified for one. The Web Rangers conference seeks to "promote digital literacy so everyone can use the internet to pursue passions, hone talents and develop skills or learn new things that matter." Mutua is not scheduled to speak at the event.

Thanks for checking out our new design, please let us know if you have feedback SFist is a website about San Francisco View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC Details Of Google's New Pixel Phone Accidentally Leaked by Jack Morse in News on Oct 3, 2016 12:45 pm Screenshot via deleted Carphone Warehouse listing. Jumping the gun on an October 4 official release date, Canadian retailer Carphone Warehouse posted technical specs and photos of the new Google Pixel phone to its website over the weekend. Although CNet reports that the company took the information down quickly, it was not before people had noticed, and, this being the internet, shared it widely. Much like Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the releases of which were also preempted by several leaks, Google is simultaneously putting out two versions of the phone. According to BGR's read of the specs, the Pixel and Pixel XL will mainly be differentiated by their sizes, and will share many of the same internal components. "Specs that are the same in both new phones include a 2.15GHz 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB/128GB storage, 12.3-megapixel camera (f/2.0, 1.55um pixels and optical image stabilization), 8-megapixel front camera, fingerprint scanner, USB-C support and NFC," BRG tells us. "Both phones will run Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box, with Google Assistant and unlimited Google Photos storage." And yes, these smartphones will have headphone jacks. The phones also appear to have a prominent "G" branding on the back (screenshots of which are below), suggesting the manufacturer doesn't want you to think of these as Alphabet phones. Google has so far declined to comment on the authenticity of the leak, and the intentionally vague Pixel website remains unchanged. Screenshot of deleted Carphone Warehouse page via Mashable.

Nothing is official, but one thing is certain: an Andromeda Box already exists and it runs the Google Brillo OS. Need proof? Here it is. Before reading on, please understand that we’re not suggesting this is what we’ll see at tomorrow’s event. Instead, we’re wishfully digging up dots and initiating a discussion about whether or not they connect. This is the Andromeda Box Below are renders of the Andromeda Box Edge, Andromeda Box Gateway, and the underlying Andromeda Box hardware. The images look more like screen captures from an 80s board game cover than marketing material, but these products are geared towards engineers and developers, not consumers. You’ll find these photos and more on AndromedaBox.org, which at first seems like a spam site, until you realized it is owned and operated by Marvell. Made by the company powering Chromecast The Andromeda Box was announced on November 2nd, 2015 by Marvell. The intro of the press release further explains the close relationship between this Andromeda Box, Google, Android, and the possibilities that lie ahead: Marvell Unveils Andromeda Box IoT Platform Made for Brillo and Weave Communication Solution Marvell offers end-to-end Andromeda Box platform integrating Google’s new operating system based on Android to help accelerate the development of IoT gateways and edge devices. Yeah, but Andromeda is supposed to be all about the marriage of Android and Chrome, not Android and IoT, right? Then consider these two facts: Chromecast was one of Google’s IoT “toe in the water” products Chromecast and Chromecast Audio are powered by Marvell’s SoC Doesn’t it seem odd that such a close partner would build a product called “Andromeda” a year ago and yet Google would hijack the name for use in their own separate initiative? Not quite. Andromeda is most likely Google’s internal code name, potentially borrowed from Marvell to signify the movement towards an Internet of Things solution that Google can finally bring to consumers. Google is an Andromeda Box partner Google hasn’t hid their participation in the Andromeda Box, listed directly in the partners section with a logo front and center. At one point the Andromeda Box was actually available for sale at SolidRun for $75 bucks. The everyday consumer would find no use in such a thing, but it’s interesting to note that there are (probably) people out there who already have an Andromeda Box. We haven’t heard from any. This is Google’s next big thing Google has wanted to become the fabric connecting your home for what seems like forever. Way back in 2011 we were wowed by Google’s @Home initiative, but even after acquisitions of Nest and Dropcam, not much ever came from it. Here we are 5 years later, wondering what happened. At Google IO 2015, Google announced Brillo and Weave, Android-based initiatives that were expected to revive the hopes and dreams of Android@Home. Here we are almost 1 year later, wondering what happened. Tomorrow, Google is expected to not only announce their Pixel phones but also on the rumored list: Google Home Google WiFi Chromecast Ultra Andromeda on Tablets Given that Marvell’s “Andromeda Box” conceptually intersects with all of these, we’re wondering if Google’s rumored “Andromeda” is merely the intersection of Android & Chrome, or something much more. Could Andromeda be the one system to rule them all, where everything is seamlessly connected to everything? Sure, Android and Chrome can enjoy their own special relationship in the world of Andromeda, but having your phone, computer, TV, garage, refrigerator, light bulbs, etc… all simultaneously interconnected without the proprietary complications of today’s IoT would be worthy of “Next Big Thing” status. Lest you think that is far-fetched, we remind you that Google’s SVP of Android thinks the event will be one of Google’s biggest announcements ever, likening it to the launch of Android itself. The Andromeda Box is like the dude’s rug… It really ties the room together. How many Google products and concepts can you spot in this video? This beautifully captures the Internet of Things promise we’ve been sold for so many years but have yet to receive. Will Google finally deliver it tomorrow in the form of Andromeda? Will Marvell and the Andromeda Box play any role? Or was this all one big coincidence tied together by wishful thinking?

It's called internally "Andromeda", according to reports by Android Police and 9to5 Google, and it's expected to become the singular platforms through which people access Google – so laptops, phones and tablets. These same reports also make mention of a hybrid, laptop-tablet device that will possibly be shown off during the otherwise Pixel phone-centered event, running the Andromeda OS. Also, why do we seem so sure that Google will have something to say about this Andromeda business? "We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today," Google SVP of Android, Chrome OS & Play Hiroshi Lockheimer tweeted on September 24. "I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016." That's why. So, let's get on with it, eh? Cut to the chase What is it? An Android-meets-Chrome, multi-device operating system When is it out? Current reports point to sometime in 2017 What will it cost? Likely nothing, as is with Android and Chrome If you ask us, either this was inspired by Andromeda, or this was the beginning What is Andromeda? First off, it's reportedly the code name for Google's oft-rumored-and-reported merging of its Android and Chrome OSes, the former being a phone and tablet platform and the latter one for its affordable laptop platform, Chromebooks. We've even seen the seeds of such a merging be sowed this year. At Google I/O 2016, the firm announced that Android apps would become available on Chromebooks, finally necessitating the odd-few Chromebooks with touchscreens. But, more importantly, this expressed Google's interest in marrying these two platforms together. Fast forward to today, and reporters expect Andromeda to offer the flexibility of a mobile OS in terms of an adaptable interface and sophisticated touch gesture support, but with the sensible – and more readily-accessible – file system and other niceties we've come to expect from our laptops. Android Police specifically claims to have heard from sources that Andromeda is the result of Google introducing Chrome features to Android, not the other way around. The outlet also suggests that the initiative to get Android apps running on Chromebooks is unrelated to Andromeda, but at the very least one had to inspire the other, whichever that is. We should count on seeing this piece of hardware more than a laptop What is the Pixel 3 – or Bison? In the same report, some of which has been corroborated by 9to5 Google's sources, Android Police details a device internally named "Bison", a hybrid computing gadget that's been already nicknamed "Pixel 3," or the de facto successor to the second Chromebook Pixel. However, that name barely applies, because the device is allegedly to not be marketed as a Chromebook, but as an entirely new approach from Google to computing. While the outlet did receive specification information from its source, it was quick to present them with a helping of salt based on when it expects Bison to release: Q3 2017. The Pixel 3 is expected to be a convertible hybrid, though some anticipate a detachable, that will come in two versions with 12.3-inch touch displays. Powering the device with be either an Intel Core m3 or Core i5 processor with either 32GB or 128GB of storage, and either 8GB or 16GB of memory (RAM). Also standard on what's assumed to be two models are, reportedly, two USB-C ports, a fingerprint scanner, 3.5mm audio jack, a bunch of sensors and stylus compatibility, with a Wacom pen sold separately. The device will also allegedly have stereo speakers, quad microphones and a battery that can last about 10 hours. Android Police also reports that the keyboard will be backlit, and the glass trackpad will use haptic feedback and force detection, similar to the 12-inch MacBook. The device is said to measure 10mm thin, which would noticeably beat Apple's thinnest laptop yet. Again, take these details with the appropriate dashing of salt, but the outlet also says to have heard that the Pixel 3 will start at $799 (about £622, AU$1,041), too. Sidenote: 9to5 Google expects the firm to release Andromeda on a Nexus-branded Huawei tablet as well, based on claims from its sources and evidence that Google has been testing the OS on a Nexus 9 tablet already. But, what will this mean for Google's hyper-affordable computers? Who knows... What could Andromeda mean for Android and Chrome? From what we're hearing, Andromeda seems to be Google's response to Microsoft and Apple's united platforms with one of its own. In turning Android into one of the main places from which Google's billions of users access the service and later capitalizing on that with Chrome OS in the classroom and workplace, Google itself has become the third major player in platforms. Again, from the sound of it, Andromeda is going to accomplish much of what Microsoft and Apple already have in Windows 10 and iOS-to-macOS Sierra Continuity, respectively, but in a very Google way. It's easy to expect access to Google's inimitable search and data-tracking at your fingertips, which it would tout as better than Microsoft's and Apple's, and an interface the changes based on the device from which it's accessed. Will this eventually mean the end of Android and Chrome? In name, most likely, but their principles would almost certainly live on – there's too much solid foundation not to build on top of it. Some predict this transition will happen gradually, and we're inclined to agree. The end result, likely to be seen long from now, will be just one platform for Google to worry about, able to push new updates and features to all versions at once, simplifying support as well as user understanding.

Citing “multiple sources” Roettgers states that the headset could be sold for as little as $79 USD (around $100 CAD). It’s unclear whether this means Google will be producing its own proof-of-concept device, or if it will be debuting a headset made in collaboration with a hardware partner. Daydream is Google’s attempt at bringing virtual reality to the masses by creating a universal platform that runs on hardware-certified VR devices, giving developers a viable VR platform to release apps, games and other software on. The headset will run using certain Daydream-certified smartphones as the screen, paired with the use of a handheld controller. Currently, the ZTE Axon 7 and Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe are the only devices released that are Daydream-certified. Minimum Daydream specifications include a Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM, 1920 x 1080 pixel OLED display and Android 7.0 Nougat. The headset’s main competition, the Samsung Gear VR headset, currently retails for $139.99 CAD. The main attraction of the 10/4 event is expected to be the launch of the Pixel and Pixel XL devices, but Google is also rumoured to be debuting a significant amount of other hardware and software, including a 4K Chromecast and Android-Chrome hybrid operating system purportedly called Andromeda.

I was kind of looking forward to comparing my Samsung Gear VR to Daydream VR. LeCanadianBacon 1920 x 1080 is the minimum requirement, which is 1080P.

The company is holding a hardware event on 4 October and has been marketing the whole thing under a "Made by Google" tagline, which suggests everything we see unveiled at the show will be Made by Google, rather than Made with Google like we've seen in the past. However, contrary to the speculation, reports indicate Google plans to announce two Pixel-branded phones made by HTC as well as a Daydream headset made by HTC. Variety has claimed the Taiwanese manufacturer is building Google's first Daydream VR headset, which is meant to be used in conjunction with either of the two new phones, and it could be sold for as much as $79. The report cited a source "with knowledge of the announcement". Google first announced its Daydream mobile VR platform last May at Google I/O 2016. It's basically an extension of the Android mobile OS. Daydream-optimized phones will enter a VR mode when inserted into a Daydream-ready headset, which are headsets that meet a certain spec criteria outlined by Google. Instead of waiting for third-party companies to launch their own Daydream headsets, which will work much in the same way that Samsung’s Gear VR headset works with select Samsung phones, Google has reportedly partnered with HTC to launch its own version. Google has actually teamed up with a number of companies to build Daydream-ready phones as well as Daydream headsets, Variety said. We're assuming it thought HTC was a good fit for its first-ever headset because the company already has experience making the HTC Vive headset that offers a more full-fledged VR experience akin to the Oculus Rift. Although Variety said the Daydream headset by Google and HTC should cost $79, Android Police first suggested the device would sell for around $80. Check out Pocket-lint's round-up to see what else Google has in store for 4 October.

We're assuming it thought HTC was a good fit for its first-ever headset because the company already has experience making the HTC Vive headset that offers a more full-fledged VR experience akin to the Oculus Rift. Although Variety said the Daydream headset by Google and HTC should cost $79, Android Police first suggested the device would sell for around $80. Check out Pocket-lint's round-up to see what else Google has in store for 4 October.

Google rebrands cloud services 'Google Cloud' and 'G Suite' Google this week said its cloud business now has a billion active users. To celebrate the milestone, the company reorganized its cloud efforts under the name 'Google Cloud' and rebranded Google Apps as 'G Suite.' Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) on 30 September, 2016 22:03 0 - - - - print email SAN FRANCISCO — Google has a dizzying array of names for its various of products and services. The company this week added another moniker when it rebranded its enterprise cloud business as "Google Cloud," which now encompasses all of Google's business cloud services. Google's affinity for changing and adding new names didn't end there. Google for Work, which is part of the new Google Cloud, received its second name change in as many years, to "G Suite." Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google Cloud, said the rebranding and repackaging will help the company organize its efforts around cloud computing, which she calls "the biggest IT transformation ever." The move could also help Google ramp up pressure on enterprise-cloud leaders, Amazon and Microsoft. Blair Hanley Frank Google Cloud chief Diane Greene speaks at a company event in San Francisco on September 29, 2016. "We've got well over 10,000 engineers working on this," including more than 600 who specialize in security, Greene said at a Google enterprise event in San Francisco on Thursday. "Google was started in the cloud. Google was built for the cloud." Google Cloud has 1 billion active users Google Cloud already has a billion active users, and 2 million businesses currently pay for G Suite and its family of apps, which includes Gmail, Docs, Drive and Calendar, according to the company. Google invested $9.9 billion in its cloud business last year and plans to invest another $12 billion by the end of 2016, said Urs Holzle, senior vice president of technical infrastructure at Google Cloud. The company's 2015 investment was "just shy of Amazon or Microsoft if you add them together," he said. Google says it's also baking more AI and machine learning into G Suite apps. For instance, the company introduced a new feature in Drive, called "quick access," that "uses your activity patterns to predictively serve up to you the file that you need," said Prabhakar Raghavan, vice president of Google Apps. "Explore," a new feature in to Docs, Sheets and Slides, automatically applies formulas to company data based on common queries from users. A retailer that wants to determine top-selling items on black Friday might use Explore, for example, according to Google. [ Related: Google goes all-in on enterprise cloud ] Customers in Google's early adopter program also get access to "Team Drives." The new offering is designed to help businesses "get away from the notion that content is owned and managed by individuals," Raghavan said. "We need to think of teams as first-class citizens and how they go about doing their work every single day." All of these new cloud enhancements mean Google must open more data centers. The company plans to set up new locations in Virginia, London, Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Sao Paulo, Frankfurt and Finland in 2017. "When you sign up to the cloud, it's a long-term bet," Greene said. "We're building a different type of cloud" by "moving away from virtualized hardware to scalable services and scalable data," Holzle said. "What used to be a purchase order now becomes an API call." Those changes transform how people use and manage IT, he said. Brand Post Top 10 Things to Love about Surface Pro 4 More from Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

The questions Europeans ask Google about the UK revealed 9:23 PM Tuesday Oct 4, 2016 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Spotlight Strange But True The Country Europeans have googled many questions about British people. Photo / Getty Images Britain is a nation of many mysteries, according to the Europeans who Google it. "Why are the British so ugly?" the Netherlands demands to know and "why do the English put milk in their tea?" inquires Hungary. Indeed, data from Google over the past year reveals the common searches made about the UK from users elsewhere in Europe - and the questions that surfaced aren't entirely flattering, Daily Mail reports. Germans have often typed the question 'why are the British so stupid?' into the iconic search engine, according to the data revealed by Search Laboratory. Italians ask why Brits are "dirty", Portuguese searchers home in on England and ask why English people are "crybabies", while Spanish users don't even dignify their views with a question, simply typing "the English are strange". Polish searchers are apparently confounded by our baking ingredients, demanding to know "why is British flour so strange?" and Austria should probably hang its head in shame for the question "is England a country or a city?" Other searches were somewhat more reasonable. The Danish have been asking why English judges wear wigs, the Finnish want to know why the Olympics refer to the UK as "Britain", while Lithuanians ponder as to why British people drive on the left side of the road. Last week, separate data was released about the most common searches made about all the countries around Europe. According to Google's autocomplete function, which uses algorithms to suggest search terms based on what you've already started typing, plenty of people write "Wales is better than England" in the search box. Tellingingly, the most popular statement about England was found to be, "England is confusing". It's tricky to test this for yourself, since the search engine will already be deeply personalised to you based on your browsing history. But it's amusing, if true, that so many people have typed "Scotland is not a real country" and "Ukraine is not a brothel" into Google. - Daily Mail Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Wyn Drabble: Xmas shopping made easy Trade Me can help you with your Christmas shopping.

Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 10.03.16. 10.03.16 Time of Publication: 5:29 pm. 5:29 pm Google Fiber Eyes A Bigger Chunk of The Airwaves Getty Images Google Fiber wants a better way of beaming the Internet into apartment buildings. On Friday, the company filed a document with the Federal Communications Commission arguing that the agency should ease access to a chunk of wireless spectrum that could serve the ambitions of Google Fiber, the company’s ultra-high-speed Internet service. The spectrum in question—the 70/80 Ghz band—is used by Webpass, the San Francisco broadband company now owned by Google Fiber (the acquisition closed today). Webpass uses this band to beam an Internet signal to the roofs of apartment buildings and condos, before stringing cables into living rooms. Google wants FCC rules that would allow it to use such technology on a much larger scale. Google Fiber is as a separate company under the umbrella operation called Alphabet, and according to some reports it is under pressure to cut costs—even as iexpands its high-speed Internet service and pushes entrenched companies like Verizon and AT&T toward similar services. A faster Internet is good for Google. Of course, it’s good for everyone. That’s why the progress of Google Fiber is worth watching. Webpass now uses a point-to-point wireless. It beams a signal to a stationary antenna, as opposed to something that’s always moving, like a mobile phone. The 70/80 GHz band works because it offers fast connections over short distances. Google wants the FCC to allow “point-to-multipoint” connections, which essentially act like clusters of point-to-point connections. Although these multipoint networks would still be made up of stationary connections, they could cover a wider area. Today, if Webpass or another company wants to build a point-to-multipoint system, it must register each link in the system. That means every node in a multipoint cluster would require a separate application to the FCC. What Google is recommending instead is the ability to register an entire area. The company’s filing came in response to a notice of proposed rule making from the FCC. As part of sweeping changes to enable 5G mobile wireless connections, the agency is considering new rules that Google worries would make it harder to register links in the 70/80 GHz band. Reading between the lines, it appears that Google is concerned that a change in licensing would slow any expansion of Webpass. Google’s comments also suggest that the company might be working on new technologies to take advantage of multipoint systems. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Luckily, that ends today. Many Nexus 6 owners have speculated that, despite being included in the Android Beta Program, Google didn’t intend to update the Nexus 6 to Nougat. That, of course, was not true as Google itself confirmed last month that updates would be coming “in a few weeks.” Today Google has finally made true on that promise, releasing both factory images and OTAs of Android Nougat for its behemoth smartphone. The new build carries the build number NBD90Z, includes the latest October 5th security patch, and weighs in at just over 850mb. The OTA is currently rolling out to all Nexus 6 owners, but if you’re feeling impatient, you can download the factory images and the OTA from Google’s site, linked below. Nexus 6: Android 7.0.0 – Factory Image Nexus 6: Android 7.0.0 – OTA With Nougat finally releasing on the Nexus 6, Google is one step closer to pushing this release to all Nexus devices.

Android 7.1 will debut in Google’s upcoming Pixel smartphones, and it’s centered around Google Assistant, an artificially intelligent bot that acts like a personalized, enhanced version of Google Now. Related: Hands on: Google Pixel and Pixel XL Google announced several new products at its October 4 event in San Francisco, including the Pixel, Pixel XL, Daydream View, Chromecast Ultra, and more. Google Assistant, which debuted on the messaging app Allo in September, will soon be in two other surfaces: the Pixel smartphones and the search giant’s $130 Amazon Echo-competitor, Google Home. It’s safe to say it’s a core part of the company’s future. But Assistant is not coming to other Android devices in the 7.1 update, at least not in the near future. In fact, Pixel smartphones have their own unique Android experience, much like how a Samsung phone has its own features compared to an LG phone. Still, there’s a decent amount to be excited about in 7.1. Here’s everything you need to know. When is 7.1 Nougat launching? If you want the latest and greatest Google and Android have to offer, you can pre-order a Pixel or Pixel XL now from Google’s website and Verizon. They’ll ship with the Pixel-exclusive features and Android 7.1 towards the end of the month. Android 7.1 Nougat launched in developer preview as part of Android Beta Program on October 20. “We’re continuing the model we used in N and earlier releases,” Google announced in a blog post. “We’re delivering the initial Developer Preview at beta quality for the Nexus lineup of devices.” Devices enrolled in the beta will receive the Android N developer preview “automatically.” Alternatively, it’s available for manual download and installation from the Android developer website. Unfortunately, the beta is only available for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and the Pixel C tablet. Google said support will be added for other devices “in November” followed by Android N’s final public release. The final release will come in December to the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C, supported Android One devices, and the Pixel and Pixel XL. It’s unclear when carriers and other manufacturers will roll out the update, but don’t expect it to be any time soon. Hardly any Android devices are running Android 7.0 Nougat. What’s coming in 7.1 Nougat? It may seem like non-Pixel users are getting the short end of the stick — particularly with the lack of Assistant-integration. Still, there are quite a few new features you’ll be able to access in the upcoming Android version update. image-keyboard-7002More Notably, App Shortcuts are back. The feature was briefly introduced during the Android Nougat beta program, but was scrapped. It mimics the 3D Touch features introduced in iOS 9 — press and hold an app icon to quickly jump into specific actions. Pixel Launcher supports the API, and more app developers will be able to for smartphones running Android 7.1. Apps can have up to five shortcuts, according to the Android Developers website. Image Keyboard support also allows developers to allow people to send content directly from the keyboard, like stickers, emojis, GIFs, and more. It’s unclear if this will be supported in Google Keyboard. Read More Night mode was initially mentioned as a part of Android 7.1 as well, but it wasn’t mentioned in the Android Developers website — it’s another feature that was dropped during the beta program of Nougat. The feature, officially called Night Light, removes blue tints from your smartphones screen at night to reduce the risks associated with the exposure before bedtime. Related: Goodbye, Google Cast! App gets rebranded as the more inclusive Google Home A lead Pixel engineer tweeted that the devices have much improved touch latency — which is also confirmed in the changelog. This means the delay from tapping the screen to receiving a response is likely much smaller than before — a feature iOS and iPhones have particularly excelled at. For the average user, though, it may hardly be noticeable. Fingerprint gestures are on the way as well. You’ll be able to swipe down your finger on the fingerprint sensor to pull down the notification shade, and swipe up to close it. These gestures will be opt-in. The very nature of how Android updates and  installed are also different. Updates will install similarly to the process run in Chromebooks — they’re installed in the background automatically on a separate partition. When your device restarts, it swaps partitions so you can use the new updated version. Daydream VR mode will also be supported in the update, as well as circular app icons, like the ones on the Pixel smartphones. A new Android on the Pixel Nougat on Google’s Pixel smartphones looks slightly different in comparison to other Android phones, like Google’s Nexus lineup. For starters, the notification drawer is black and the brightness slider is blue, as opposed to grey and a teal blue slider on Nexus devices. These color changes are meant to accent the Pixel with Google colors, and that includes the white, filled in navigation buttons. google android nougat oMore google android nougat oMore google android nougat oMore The Settings menu also features a similar black color accent, but you’ll immediately notice something new — you can swipe left to a new tab to access Google’s support team. You can start a phone call, or a live chat to resolve any issues you have with the device. There’s also a screen share option that lets the support representative look at your phone to make things a little easier. These support features are not included in Nougat 7.1. Pixel Launcher is also tied to the Pixel for now, and it includes a swipe up feature to access the app drawer, a new search and voice search icon, the date and weather on the home page, and a dynamic calendar date icon. The latter changes the date on the Google Calendar icon to match with the actual date. There’s also a wallpaper picker that improves the process of setting your wallpaper, along with adding more options. Google rebuilt the camera experience for the Pixels from the ground up, and so to entice consumers to try it out, Pixel owners will be able to back up the full resolution of their photographs and videos to Google Photos for free. This was already an option in the Photos app, but it would eat up storage in your Google account. Tying into the free back up feature, Smart Storage works in the background and automatically removes old backed up photos and videos from your device to clear up space. These are still backed up to the Photos cloud, so you don’t have to worry about losing them. Related: The battle of the entry-level headsets: Google’s Daydream View vs. Samsung’s Gear VR Speaking of photos and videos, the electronic image stabilization demoed at the event will be exclusive to the Pixel as well. This is a new video stabilizing method Google built into the Pixel’s cameras, and it offers smoother video playback. According to a changelog posted by Android Police, there are several “Pro” features from the Pixel camera that aren’t included in 7.1 as well — white balance presets, exposure compensation, Automatic Exposure and Automatic Focus locking, and viewfinder grid modes. Smartburst, which takes multiple photos and selects the best one, and hardware-accelerated HDR+ image processing are also only available on the Pixel. Google Pixel phoneMore Because the Pixel smartphones are “made by Google,” they allow for tighter hardware and software integration — similar to how well iOS is integrated with the iPhone’s internals. An Android Sensor Hub processor in Google’s Pixels feature “tightly integrated sensors,” including the accelerometer, gyroscope, cell, GPS, Wi-Fi connectivity, and more. Packaged in the box is a Quick Switch adapter, which makes transferring data from an iPhone to the Pixel easy and fast. The set up process for the Pixel also features a new look. But the biggest Pixel feature that’s not coming to Android 7.1 is Google Assistant. It’s tightly integrated with Pixel — just press the home button to activate the AI bot. You can ask it to help you with almost everything, from ordering an Uber to playing a song on YouTube, and more. A Google Pixel lead engineer tells Digital Trends that Google is “exploring” ways to bring Assistant to other Android devices, but it may take a while or may never even see the light of day. “Our goal is to make the Google Assistant widely available to users, and we’ll continue to launch new surfaces over the course of the next year,” a Google spokesperson tells TechCrunch.

Europe's competition regulator, the European Commission, is "intent" on changing Alphabet's business practices and levying "significant" fines, according to the Journal. Documents show the Commission intends to establish that Google and Alphabet have infringed EU antitrust rules, Journal reporter Natalia Drozdiak wrote. The report comes after Reuters reported that regulators planned to order Google to stop paying financial incentives to smartphone-makers to pre-install Google Search exclusively on their devices. Separately, Google may have to rank rival shopping services the same as its own, Reuters reported. Google told Reuters: "We look forward to showing the European Commission that we've designed the Android model in a way that's good for both competition and consumers, and supports innovation across the region."

The new group, run by Google executive Diane Greene, includes web-based work software such as Docs and Sheets, machine-learning and digital-mapping tools that other companies can rent over the internet, and Android phones, tablets and Chromebook laptops designed for office users, Google said in a statement. “It’s uniquely Google -- a broad set of technologies and products from all parts of the cloud,” Greene said at a company event in San Francisco. Google’s work software, renamed G Suite, has been around for years and is popular with individuals, startups and other smaller companies. While these programs have always been offered over the web, they weren’t delivered as part of a broader cloud computing service. Greene is combining them to offer a fuller range of services to companies looking to move applications and other work functions to cheaper, more flexible rented data centers. Google also said Thursday its cloud service now has more than one billion end-users, through the products and services that other companies run on its servers. And Urs Hölzle, Google’s longtime infrastructure boss, said Google had invested $9 billion on its cloud division over the past twelve months. He didn’t share revenue numbers. Greene’s new division has considerable ground to make up. Amazon’s cloud business generated close to $8 billion in sales in 2015 and posted a 58 percent revenue increase in the most-recent quarter. Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue doubled in the second quarter. Google is fourth in cloud services behind Amazon, Microsoft and International Business Machines Corp., according to Synergy Research Group. Microsoft also leads in work software still, and it’s Office 365 web-based software suite is popular. On Thursday, Google unveiled new locations for its rentable servers in Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland and Frankfurt. More regions will be announced next year, it said. Google also said it had picked up two new cloud customers, retailer The Home Depot Inc. and Pokemon Go, the viral mobile game. Over the last year, Google has pushed aggressively to woo larger cloud clients, which have in the past mostly gone to Amazon, Microsoft or used their own computer servers and data centers. Google also introduced a new customer support unit within its cloud division, called Customer Reliability Engineering. Google engineers will work closely with other companies’ operations teams to make sure important cloud applications run reliably, Google said. It’s a necessary upgrade. Despite its technical prowess, Google has faced criticism for not managing customer relations as carefully as competitors like Amazon. Greene, a Silicon Valley veteran and Google board member, joined the search provider full time in November to revamp its cloud and corporate software efforts. Since then, she has hired more sales and marketing staff and presided over several acquisitions, including the recent $625 million purchase of software developer Apigee. Greene’s early work has started to show up in Google’s bottom line. Parent company Alphabet Inc. reported in July that "Other" revenue rose 33 percent to a record $2.17 billion in the second quarter, driven by cloud and corporate software businesses.

The filter, spotted by the Financial Post‘s Josh McConnell, says “Best thing about Monday? Tuesday.” There’s also a Google Now tab peeking into the frame at the top right. The filter appears to be region locked, likely only showing up in the San Francisco area, where the event will be held. Interesting. Google has a Snapchat filter to tease the big event tomorrow. #MadeByGoogle pic.twitter.com/a6YjM6PGGa — Josh McConnell (@joshmcconnell) October 3, 2016 The event is expected to see the debut of its new premium Pixel smartphones along with a slew of other new hardware and software, including a 4K enabled Chromecast, a new Android-Chrome hybrid OS purportedly called Andromeda and a Google Wi-Fi home router. Announcements regarding Google’s Daydream VR project and Google’s AI products, Home and Assistant, are also expected. Google has been promoting the event more heavily than it has in the past, even going so far as to invite select lucky fans to attend the San Francisco event via Twitter DM. The event, which will be held at 12p.m. EST, will be viewable on Google’s YouTube page. MobileSyrup will also be covering the event live from Google’s Toronto-based event.

Bridget Carey rounds up all the company's newly announced gadgets and discusses how Google is targeting Apple and Amazon. by Bridget Carey 2:47 Close Drag It feels like forever since the first rumors about Google's announcements for this event started cropping up, but now we can finally lay at least some of them to rest. Just joining us? Here's what you've missed thus far. The event opened with a cute video by the characters of HBO's "Silicon Valley." "Why wasn't I on the beta?!" That was followed by a summary by Sundar Pichai of computing since the first PC. "We're moving from a mobile first to an AI first" world." That means Google Assistant, announced at the Google I/O conference in May, with its voice queries, contextually relevant information and so on -- much like the most current version of Apple's Siri. Cue pitch about all Google's ongoing work in machine-learning-related tech. 35 Google's Pixel hardware event Going further requires getting it in the hands of users to see how they really interact, which it began with the release of Google Allo. Now Google Assistant comes to your phone and home. Rick Osterloh of the company's new Hardware group took the stage to explain how Google is well situated to meld hardware and software. A new family of home grown devices is the result. Hands-on with Google's Pixel and Pixel XL phones Lexy Savvides checks out Google's new Pixel and Pixel XL, both of which boast the Snapdragon 821 processor and sport a 12-megapixel camera. by Lexy Savvides 2:03 Close Drag First up, the phone: it's dubbed Pixel, which comes as a surprise to no one. There's a new material design with rounded icons and Google Assistant right on the home screen (where you probably can't get rid of it). In addition to being shiny, the phone includes: Google Assistant The camera, which it claims is the best ever. As you might expect from Google, its camera incorporates a lot more computational photography than most, such as a burst-shooting best-shot chooser (Smart Burst); HDR+, which works in any light and uses multiple short exposures for better exposures and has "zero" shutter lag and fast processing; and better-than-average digital stabilization. (We have a lot more details about the Pixel camera.) Unlimited Google Photos storage. Google Duo, the company's video calling app announced at Google I/O. Up to 7 hours of battery life on 15 minutes of charging. Android 7, Nougat. It automatically downloads and installs updates in the background. (I hope you can turn that off.) It has built in Google support chatting. Plus easy migration from iPhone! A new line of cases with photos. It comes in two sizes, 5 inches and 5.5 inches. They have the same hardware specs. They start at $649, AU$1,079 or £599, and are available for preorder in the US, Australia and the UK. Daydream View: Google's new VR viewer Google's new VR viewer is made from soft fabric for comfort and includes a touch-sensitive controller. 2:26 Close Drag Then Google moved on to virtual reality, with its new Daydream View headset. The platform was announced at Google I/O in May, a programming interface combining software, phone hardware and headsets. Today the company rolled out the first Daydream-compatible VR headset, the Daydream View, and a reasonably priced one at that: $79, £69 or AU$119 converted. Highlights: It uses a fabric cover for looks and comfort, it's 30 percent lighter than most headsets, comes in slate, snow and crimson colors and can fit over eyeglasses. Your phone drops in, auto aligns and auto connects. The controller has built in gyros sensitive enough for drawing, and it fits into the phone slot when not in use so you don't lose it. New Daydream apps include a "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" tie-in wand game; Star Chart, an educational astronomy app; a first-person space shooter game; movies in VR from the major streaming sites; and more. Google Play Movies, Google Photos, Street View, Maps and YouTube will have immersive Daydream support. It will be available in November. 12 Google Daydream is VR for everyone (pictures) Homeward bound. We weren't terribly thrilled by Google's OnHub router, which debuted about a year ago, but it's now turned into Google Wifi. It's modular, can work as a mesh in your home with multiple access points, and has built-in smarts to optimize the signal strength as you roam through your house. You can turn it off remotely, as well. Preorders start in November, but in the US only. It ships in December and will cost $130 for a single, or $300 for a three-pack. Playing catch-up with others in the crowded video streamer space, Google added 4K UHD support with HDR and Dolby Vision to its new higher-end Chromecast Ultra, for a not-terribly-onerous $69, £69 or AU$99. It's available in the US, UK and Australia. Google Play Videos will have content for it, it's faster than before with better Wi-Fi support and it now has an Ethernet port. 13 Smart speaker showdown? Google Home braces for battle with Amazon's Alexa First revealed in May 2016 at Google I/O, the company's developer conference, this virtual-assistant competitor for Amazon Echo finally arrives. Google Home incorporates all the features of Google Assistant, plus smart home controls. The microphones are optimized for better voice recognition, there's a way to turn the mic off, you can swap bases and Google says the speakers are great. Google Assistant features include intelligent voice-activated music-streaming playback, get answers to lots of questions, get traffic info and translations, summarizes information you need for your day (such as tasks and weather) and more. Partnerships with IFTTT, Samsung, Philips and Nest will allow Google Home to control home electronics. It can play and control media on TVs and home audio systems using Google Cast (Netflix will support voice control), and it's smarter about using multiple Home devices. Google Home will cost $130 -- with a free six-month trial of YouTube Red, the video site's ad-free service. You can preorder now and it will ship on November 4. It's US-only for now. A new Actions programming interface for Google Assistant will let third-party software developers access it to perform conversation-based app-specific operations and direct "do it" actions. There's a new embedded Google Assistant SDK for next year, so developers can embed the capabilities in their apps. And that's all, folks!

IN this post, we'll round up everything you should expect to see unveiled during Google’s big October 4th press conference. DON’T MISS: Everything there is to know about Google’s new Pixel phones just leaked Pixel and Pixel XL The two new Google phones have been in the news for months now, and thanks to a carrier and a phone reseller we know pretty much everything there is to know about them. Formerly believed to be 2016 Nexus devices, the Pixel and Pixel XL are going to be the phones Google uses to combat Apple's new iPhone 7 lineup. They’re both high-quality flagship smartphones, featuring top-of-the-line specs. Expect them to be pricing in line with iPhones as well when they're made available for preorder — probably tomorrow, right after the show. The Pixels will have a custom version of Android preloaded, complete with brand new tricks and Google’s new Assistant. Google Home We know it’s coming, we know it’s called Google Home (pictured above), and we know it’s going to run Google’s Assistant AI software. Google Home is Google’s response to Amazon’s popular voice-controlled Echo speaker lineup. Tomorrow, Google will finally tell us how much it’ll cost and when it’ll start shipping. google-chromecast-ultraMore Chromecast 4K The Chromecast is another popular Google product and the company will launch a new version of the media player, one that will support 4K resolution. The new Chromecast 4K might not be an accessory you need right now, though. Google Wi-Fi Speaking of accessories, Google is also working a new router of its own. Called Google Wi-Fi, the device is supposed to improve Wi-Fi reception at home. The gadget might be Google’s response to Eero, and it could replace the nifty Google OnHub router users have loved so far. Daydream View Remember when Google talked about a new Android-based virtual reality initiative at Google I/O? The company called it Daydream and at the time, Google said that it would be available to customers who own upcoming high-end Android smartphones. Google is tipped to unveil the Daydream View this week, and the first device will likely work with the brand new Pixels. After all, you can’t use a VR headset made for mobile devices without one of those high-end smartphones in it. New Huawei (Nexus?) tablet The Nexus smartphones might be dead, but Google may still unveil a new Nexus tablet on Tuesday. Made by Huawei and featuring a display that measures 7 inches, the tablet may also run Andromeda in the future. Which brings us to… Andromeda Andromeda is the internal codename given to a new Android-based operating system that also contains plenty of Chrome OS features. It’s not clear at this time exactly what Andromeda has to offer, but Google might make Andromeda its one-more-thing announcement at the show tomorrow. Andromeda is supposed to give Google a better footing in the laptop and tablet business, where it might finally be able to better compete against Macs and Windows 10. Andromeda won’t be ready for mass consumption until next year, reports has said, which is when Google will launch a high-end MacBook killer.

Users who want to openly discuss racist conspiracies without being flagged by Twitter's online abuse team have developed slang to fly under the politically correct radar.  Racist Trump twitter has come up with a new coded way to share racial slurs w/ each other and avoid account suspension.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CtrmGpSXgAAYW2J.jpg:large It's being called "Operation Google" — a campaign to spoil Google's new set of anti-harassment tools, called Conversation AI, which come from a subsidiary of Google called Jigsaw that works to tackle the problem of hate speech on the internet. In response, 4chan trolls are using "Google" as a slur for black people. A full list of the slang and its targets was posted on 4chan on Sept. 21. It includes terms such as Skype, Yahoo and Skittle to mean Jew, Mexican and Muslim, respectively.  Source: Alex Goldman/Twitter Skittle, in this instance, refers to Donald Trump Jr.'s recent controversial tweet — a photo of a bowl of Skittles used as a metaphor for Syrian refugees. Trump Jr. posted the meme two days before the slang surfaced on 4chan. Using words that are innocent and unassuming at face value gives internet trolls a safe cover to spout racist theories without the risk of getting their accounts shut down for violating Twitter's rules on hate speech. When asked over email if Twitter is aware of this code (it certainly is now!) and what a user should do to flag this type of content, a Twitter spokesperson sent a link to the page describing its abusive behavior policy, along with a link to the Know Your Meme page on Operation Google. "You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease," Twitter's policy notes.  The alt-right has taken to using slang or code in the past to circumvent harassment policies. As Mic previously reported, white supremacists on Twitter use three parentheses around a name to identify and target Jews online. Alt-right trolls from 4chan are also responsible for turning the Pepe the Frog meme into a Nazi symbol, and the Anti-Defamation League added the meme to its online hate symbol database on Tuesday. While Twitter already has a reputation for its poor handling of abuse, 4chan's Operation Google campaign adds another level of complexity to an already challenging task for artificial intelligence. It'll have to detect hateful intention in tweets like these, which make no sense unless you know the context.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google looking into buying Twitter, says report By Michelle Quinn / October 3, 2016 at 11:33 AM Google has hired the financial advisory firm Lazard to review possibly purchasing Twitter, Bloomberg reports. Twitter’s shares, after sliding downhill from its peak of $69 in 2014, were up more than 4 percent Monday to $24.05. The list of possible Twitter suitors includes Salesforce.com, Disney, Microsoft and Viacom. Google, whose parent company is Alphabet, may make the most sense given that it has long struggled to create a popular social media platform. As Queenie Wong noted, interest in Twitter as an acquisition target picked up this summer when Microsoft bought LinkedIn. Twitter received interest from Salesforce and hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Allen & Co. to help with a potential deal, Bloomberg reported. Although Twitter has struggled to increase its user base in the era of Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp, it still has a lot to offer a potential buyer. There are 313 million monthly active Twitter users. The platform has become a critical tool for commenting on real-time news and events. But Salesforce’s interest in the company has baffled most observers. As I wrote in a column, Salesforce’s CEO Marc Benioff has long been a Twitter admirer and user: It is hard to find a way that Salesforce buying Twitter makes sense except love. Love of Twitter, for its real-time platform, its 24/7 river of opinions and news, its 10-year history of being the place many go to talk when something happens in their cities or in the world. In May, Twitter shares were trading at close to $14. With rumors of a possible sale, Twitter’s stock has nearly doubled, making an acquisition more expensive.

By Jason Cipriani | October 3, 2016 -- 20:59 GMT (13:59 PDT) | Topic: Google Google's Daydream VR headset will cost $79. Google on Tuesday is expected to announce a healthy list of hardware products at an event in San Francisco, Calif. From two Pixel (not Nexus) smartphones to a Google Wi-Fi router, Google Home personal assistant, and 4K Chromecast devices, Google is also expected to announce its first Daydream virtual-reality headset. According to a report from Variety, Google's Daydream VR headset will cost $79. Also worth noting is the headset will reportedly be manufactured by HTC, the same company rumored as the manufacturer of the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Now, before you get too excited, keep in mind that price is in addition to the cost of the Pixel or Pixel XL smartphone required to use the headset. They'll presumably be the first two devices available with support for Google's Daydream VR platform. More Google ​Google Pixel smartphones: Will specs, $649 starting price, assistant make 'made by Google' matter? Amazon Echo and Google Home: Where the real battleground lies Google destroys the Android fan myth that the iPhone is too expensive Daydream View VR headset available in November for $79 Google Home will sell for $129, launch partners include Nest, IFTTT Google Wifi aims to improve your home's wireless network Why pay a premium when every phone runs the same apps? Still, Google's Daydream platform will lower the barrier for those who want to experience virtual reality without purchasing a powerful gaming PC often required to run the HTC Vive or Oculus' VR dedicated headset. Google first unveiled Daydream during Google I/O, its developer conference, in May 2016. The Daydream platform is built directly into Android 7.0 Nougat and will allow Android developers to build immersive apps and games. Google's approach to VR with Daydream is similar to Samsung's Gear VR line, wherein a user places a compatible smartphone into a headset. The phone provides the display and computing power to drive the virtual-reality experience. Google is also requiring a handheld controller to move and interact within a virtual-reality app or experience, unlike Samsung's Gear VR headset, which relies on a trackpad on the side of the headset for interaction. Google created a set of requirements, including specifications such as processor speed and display quality, which a device manufacturer must meet in order for a phone to be certified "Daydream-ready". ZTE's Axon 7, for example, is Daydream-ready and priced at just $399. We will have a full report of everything announced during Google's hardware event, which kicks off Oct. 4 at 12 pm ET.

We may never know. UPDATE, Afternoon 10/5: A few hours after I wrote the apology below, David Ruddock from Android Police said Google confirmed to him that HTC was, in fact, involved in the design of the device, contrary to reports from yesterday that HTC was a mere manufacturing partner for a Google-designed phone: @saschasegan @iansltx yeah I'd say that if that's the quote, they're not being accurate. HTC's role was not strictly in being a factory. — David Ruddock (@RDR0b11) October 5, 2016 I'm confused at this point, and as Google doesn't talk to me, I'm just passing along what I hear. I'm going to close this thread and move on to more important questions, like reviewing what looks to be a really nice Android phone, when we get it. UPDATE, Morning 10/5: I got this one wrong, and I'd like to apologize. I based my column on leaks and public documents available before the launch, which showed the Pixel to be an HTC product, but I learned after the launch that the extent of Google's involvement was being understated at that point. I'm also impressed by Google's commitment to self-supporting the phone, something I didn't foresee. After the launch of the Pixel, sources and other press reports confirmed to me that Google was in fact involved in the design of the device from the beginning, and that it was not a pre-existing, re-branded HTC device. Why'd I get it wrong? While I have a lot of sources in the mobile industry who usually prevent me from saying dumb things, Google almost never speaks to me. The sources I did rely on foregrounded HTC's role, and didn't reveal the extent of Google's involvement. I am still frustrated that Google's sales strategy doesn't involve being sold through all four major US carriers, which has in the past been a requirement for a phone to become a sales leader. That said, I like what I see of the Pixel—especially the 5-inch model—and I'm hoping to get one in my hands soon. It could potentially replace my Galaxy S7. Original Story: Over the next few days, you're going to hear a lot of spin about "Google phones" and how the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones, which are presumably being announced at an event in San Francisco tomorrow, are "made by Google." Even the promotional URL is madeby.google.com. Google could very well create a solely Google-branded phone, entirely engineered by Google, with the help of a manufacturing partner that likes to sit in the background and just follow orders, like Apple does with Foxconn. And then it could sell that phone, everywhere, aggressively, making itself one of the leading high-end smartphone firms in the world. But Google isn't doing that. Google has participated in phone design for six years now with its Nexus line. The Pixel phones have been known for months now as the HTC Sailfish and HTC Marlin. HTC has a long history of co-developing and designing devices with partners. That includes Google's original Nexus One and the first Android phone, the T-Mobile G1. Notice that the G1 didn't have the HTC name anywhere on it, but that didn't make it a "Google phone." Really, the only difference between the most recent Nexus phones and the upcoming Pixel phones seems to be that the name of the manufacturer, HTC, won't be on the body of the device. The real shift from Nexus to Pixel, I suspect, isn't about how the phone is made or designed. It's in how Google wants to sell it. The Nexus devices were always first and foremost developer phones, giving developers a "clean" copy of Android on which to test apps. Pixel devices may be targeted at high-end consumers as well. But unlike Apple, Google still has a reason not to try hard to sell many phones. Why Google Won't Sell Too Many Pixels Unlike Microsoft on the desktop, Google's OEM partners have other places to turn. Microsoft can help drive Windows laptops forward with its Surface line in part because laptop makers don't have any other good OS options. They've tried Linux in the past, and they've seen few sales. They can't go with macOS. Consumers and businesses both want either Windows or macOS on their desktops and laptops. So manufacturers will put up with Surface as a competitor. Google's money comes not from hardware, but from services and data collection. Although "Android" is the global dominant mobile OS, that doesn't mean mobile firms need to go with Google's Android—the version containing all of the Google services and Google data collection. China has an entire separate "Chinese Android" ecosystem. BlackBerry and Samsung have both shown how BlackBerry 10 and Tizen can run Android apps, if necessary. In the mobile realm, Google's position is less secure than that of Microsoft in desktops. In part to keep its manufacturer partners calm, the Nexus devices have always been hard to buy, at least in the US. Yeah, sure, we've seen Nexus TV ads, but Google has never pushed them hard at retail. Most recently, Nexus phones have been sold online and unlocked only, when 90 percent of Americans get their (mostly Apple and Samsung) phones through wireless carriers. That gets Nexus devices into the hands of the developers and geeks who really want them, without rocking the boats of Samsung, LG, HTC, and other Android licensees. I can't see this changing with the Pixel, because Google's position is still insecure. //Related Articles 9 Cool Features Hidden in Android 7.0 Nougat Just Because We Want It, Doesn't Mean We'll Get It Why do we want a "Google phone," anyway? Google's products are best known for speed, simplicity, and clarity. (Although in real life, that isn't always the case: look at Google's hideous mess of messaging apps.) But to differentiate themselves, Android phone makers tend to fill their phones with cruft which slows them down. And nearly every Android device except Nexus gets updates late, if ever. At the high end, the only manufacturer close to Google's "stock" Android build that we can think of is Motorola. There's no sign the overall situation is going to change tomorrow. We'll see a good Android 7.1 phone with a lot of cool features that happens to look like an iPhone. It might even be an Editors' Choice. We won't see a heavily marketed, Google-designed phone available on all four major carriers with a sales push that unseats Samsung in the front of carrier stores across the nation. The Pixel phones aren't made by Google. They probably won't be sold in a new way. That doesn't mean they're bad. HTC makes great phones, and Android 7.1 will have great features. But if you're looking for a game changer, these aren't your Droids.

Google is expected to release Google Home, its much-hyped rival to the Amazon Echo, along with several other hardware products, at an event in San Francisco Oct. 4. Google Home integrates Assistant, a virtual assistant technology released earlier this year that is similar to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa in function. Assistant is designed to let users carry on what the company has described as a two-way dialogue with Google using conversational speech. Google Home is a small voice-activated consumer device that uses Google Assistant. It will let home users use normal speech to control things like their smart home lighting and heating systems and to set timers for various synced-up devices. It will also deliver local news and movie information, and provide weather updates. In introducing the technology at Google's I/O conference earlier this year, Mario Queiroz, the company's vice president of product management, said Home would give users continued access to Google inside their homes in a hands-free fashion and without needing their phones or tablets. "Google Home lets you enjoy music and entertainment throughout your entire house, manage everyday tasks more easily, and ask Google what you want to know," Queiroz said. Anyone in the family will be able to interact with Assistant and with Home by speaking to it, he noted. Google Home supports what is known as far-field voice recognition. In other words, the device is capable of recognizing and responding to spoken commands from across a room even with a lot of other background noise. Like Amazon's Echo, Google Home is also a Bluetooth speaker. People can use it to stream music from the web or from their mobile devices and to cast it to other Google Cast-enabled devices. Users can access their song playlists and podcasts from any online music services that they are subscribed to using voice commands, according to Queiroz. Google Home's support for Cast enables multi-room playback so users can listen to a song or podcast on speakers in multiple rooms. Google Home also lets home users stream and control video content from the web to a TV screen of their choice. "Just tell Google Home, and the content will appear on the biggest, brightest screen in your house," Queiroz said when introducing the product in May. Analysts see Home as giving Google an opportunity to make up ground that it lost to Amazon over the last two years in the market for digital home assistants. The Echo by most accounts has been an unexpected hit for Amazon. Between its launch in November 2014 and June of this year, Amazon is believed to have sold some 4 million Echo units at just under $200 per device. "The launch of Google Home with Google Assistant up-levels Google's play as a virtual assistant," said Julie Ask, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, in a statement. "[It] is a natural extension of Google's path toward becoming the agent that sits between brands and their customers." The product could deliver unprecedented business value for Google. But the company will have its work cut out making an impression in the consumer virtual assistant market, she said. One big problem is that Google does not have a strong record of selling anything direct to consumer. "The Google Assistant is likely to be the driving force behind Google's hardware moves," said Thomas Husson, a vice president at Forrester. "The end game for Google is to embed its intelligent agent to power conversations into multiple vertically integrated services like Mail, Search or Maps and into multiple devices like the new Google Home."           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   Google, Intel to Collaborate on Cloud, IoT Technolgies Social Media Sites Take Risks When Blocking Speech They Don't Like Google Seeks To Make Job Searches Easier With New Cloud API Snapchat Files for IPO, May Go Public Next March Google, Facebook Move To Curb Ads On 'Fake News' Sites                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

In case you haven't been keeping track, you may ask, "When is the Google event?" Well, the Google Pixel event time is 9:00am PT (9:30pm IST) on Tuesday, and Gadgets 360 will be covering the event live from San Francisco - so stay tuned. So, what should you expect from Google's October 4 event? As Gadgets 360 reported back in August, Google this year has a very different game plan to promote its Android mobile platform. The company has set up a unified hardware division under the former President of Motorola Mobility, Rick Osterloh, and the fruits of that labour are due to be unveiled.Google is doing away with the value-for-money Nexus lineup, and is instead looking to offer a premium lineup of smartphones that will compete head-on with Apple's iPhone series - with the aim of enjoying the same highly-desirable status in the market. Innumerable leaks since have corroborated our report, with Google anticipated to launch its Pixel series of smartphones with two offerings - the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. Of course, the Google October 4 event will see the launch of more than just the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. The search giant is expected to launch its Google Home smart speaker - a competitor to the Amazon Echo - that was unveiled at Google I/O 2016 will be powered by Google Assistant, the company's re-branded voice-based virtual assistant that will replace Google Now. Alongside, other products are also rumoured, such as the Google Chromecast Ultra - a 4K video dongle - apart from the Google Wi-Fi smart router, which is said to be the next iteration of the OnHub router. The Daydream VR platform that was unveiled at Google I/O this year is also expected to make an appearance, with its first hardware - the Daydream VR headset - due to be launched. All of these hardware products have received their fair share of leaks in the past few months, revealing several details. On the software front, Google is also anticipated to unveil what's internally said to be called Andromeda OS, the long-rumoured and oft-deniedmerger between Android and Chrome OS - the company's Chrome-based operating system for laptops and PCs. This merger is thought to be what Hiroshi Lockheimer (SVP of Android, Chrome, and Google Play) was hinting at with this cryptic tweet that Google's October 4 event is going to be as significant as Android's launch 8 years ago. While the first hardware to run the merger, which would finally bring Android to the PC category, isn't expected at the event - a developer preview is anticipated at the Google Pixel event. Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones Coming back to the Google Pixel phones - as we mentioned, a lot is already known about them, and, thanks to leaks by UK retailer Carphone Warehouse and two Canadian carriers, we not only know what they will look like, but also their near-complete specifications. Since then, Verizon also briefly listed the smartphones, revealing even more details. Both smartphones appear to be identical in design, with only size separating them. Both Google Pixel and Pixel XL will run on Android 7.1 Nougat at launch, and come with the already leaked Pixel Launcher - the differentiation that Google CEO Sundar Pichai is thought to be referring when he said this year's Nexus lineup would be Google's opportunity to be more "opinionated" with its offerings. They have been spotted in Black and White colour variants, with another rumour pointing towards a third Gold offering as well. Live Cases (seen below) are also anticipated, using imagery from Google Earth and Google Trends. The Google Pixel is expected to sport a 5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) Amoled display with a pixel density of 441ppi, and Corning's Gorilla Glass 4 for protection. It is said to be powered by a 2.15GHz quad-core Snapdragon 821 SoC with 4GB of RAM. The Google Pixel is listed with a 2770mAh battery. The Google Pixel XL on the other hand is set to feature a 5.5-inch Quad HD (1440x2560 pixels) display with a pixel density of 534ppi and once again bearing Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection. Once again, it's said to be powered by a 2.15GHz Snapdragon 821 SoC coupled with 4GB of RAM. The Google Pixel XL is said to come with a 3450mAh battery. Both the Google Pixel and Pixel XL were seen to come in 32GB and 128GB built-in storage variants, and notably, microSD card slots were also listed - though expandable storage seems unlikely if one considers none of the Nexus smartphones bore this feature. Both the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are also set to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera and an 8-megapixel front camera complete with optical image stabilisation. A feature called Smartburst is also rumoured, similar to Apple's Live Photos. The smartphones are also said to sport fingerprint sensors on the rear panel. As for software features, the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones will come bundled with the Pixel Launcher, the Google Assistant, Google Allo, and Google Duo apart from the regular Google apps. The smartphones will also come with unlimited photo backups at full resolution via Google Photos. As for pricing - the Google Pixel is expected to start from $649 (roughly Rs. 43,200). Coming to the most recent leak, the Verizon listing of the smartphones, we learn that Google may introduce a Blue colour variant as well. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones are also listed to feature something called 'Google Magic', and while this may just be marketing jargon signifying the Google touch, it could also be a new feature. Google Home, Google Wi-Fi, Chromecast Ultra, and Daydream VR headset Details on these fronts are a little scarcer. The Google Home smart speaker (seen above), the Google Assistant-powered rival to the Alexa-powered Amazon Echo, is expected to be priced at $129 (roughly Rs. 8,500). That's $40 cheaper than the Amazon Echo. It is expected to be the central hub of home automation, with compatibility for IoT products like Samsung's SmartThings, and other third-party devices. A single Google Home app is also expected to be released, similar to Apple's Home app, which will control all compatible home automation and IoT products from a single point, apart from controlling all Google Cast devices. As for the 4K Chromecast Ultra dongle (seen below), it's said to be nearly identical to the current Chromecast 2 dongle, but feature the new Google 'G' logo and do away with the Chrome logo seen on the present iteration. Apart from supporting 4K streaming capabilities, it is anticipated to also support HDR. It's said to be priced at $69 (roughly Rs. 4,600), and also sport a hardware on/off button. Coming to Google Wi-Fi or Google WiFi (the naming is a bit unclear at this point), it is said to be smart router like the Google OnHub, but also create a unified network unlike the previous offering. A "mesh" or "modular" technology is also expected to be incorporated, allowing the network to expanded over a great area. It is also said to be priced at $129 (roughly Rs. 8,500). Finally, we come to the Daydream VR headset (seen below), which is expected to launch alongside a wireless motion-based controller unveiled at Google I/O. Like the more basic Google Cardboard, the Daydream VR headset will be powered by the smartphone, and not sport any sensors on board. A much more polished effort without any of the flimsiness associated with Cardboard, it will work only with Daydream ready smartphones running on Android Nougat, optimised for minimal latency and higher refresh rates. It is said to be priced at $80 (roughly Rs. 5,300). We discuss what you can expect from Google's October 4 event, featuring Pixel smartphones, Andromeda, and more on Orbital: The Gadgets 360 Podcast.

Google will unveil its answer to Amazon's Echo at an event on Tuesday, the New York Times reports. The Google Home device, which looks like an "air freshener," is expected to go on sale later this month (Editor's note: the link could be paywalled; alternate source), the publication added. The Google Home is powered by what Google calls Assistant, which uses "artificial intelligence" to understand what users are saying and respond conversationally with the best answers. "Amazon is the accidental winner here," Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business at New York University, told the paper. "Amazon got there first, which is superimpressive, and it has been a huge hit." From the report: Google is a leader in natural language processing -- the ability to turn spoken words into terms that computers can digest -- and its search engine is the starting point for how most people get answers on the internet. In fact, the company says 20 percent of Google searches on mobile phones are done by voice. So why didn't Google create an Echo-like device before Amazon? In part, Google was hindered by a balkanized structure that prevented different groups within the company from working together, according to four current and former employees. Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., had a large team working on voice search but its focus was on an app for smartphones. The company had a separate team working on the Android operating system, which runs on smartphones, tablets and internet-connected home devices, and they were building virtual assistant technology into mobile devices.Google is also expected to launch two new smartphones, expected to be called Pixel and Pixel XL. Earlier today, both the phones showed up on a retailer's website, revealing their specifications. The Guardian reports: The leaked images show two sizes of the phone -- a regular and "XL" version, USB-C fast charging, a new interface, video calling and the Google Assistant, which first launched within the company's Allo messaging app. Both devices will have 32GB or 128GB of storage, 4GB of RAM, Qualcomm's latest 821 processor, AMOLED screens, fingerprint scanners on the back, an eight-megapixel selfie camera and a 12-megapixel camera on the back with optical image stabilisation, according to the smartphone retailers listings which have since been removed. amazon google ai ← You may like to read: → Facebook Launches Marketplace On App, Takes On eBay and Craigslist Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Ask Slashdot: Would You Recommend Updating To Windows 10?

It listens for the keyword (default: "Alexa") and only processes queries following that keyword. Inquiries should be send to the best source of that information, not all to the company that made the device. This is not feasible within a reasonable price point. You can't do full voice recognition and semantic analysis on $149 worth of hardware.

Signal processing is handled with dedicated hardware. A simple database stores samples, rules, and weights, as well as references to the user's details and shit like their calendar or email. The database can live in local storage or in an sd card. Storage space isn't an issue though access speed may be (don't include a cheapo class 4 SD card).

Well, the folks at Sony are here to help you with that. Ahead of the release of Inferno, starring Tom Hanks, sleuths in the making can take part in a “three-week race against time” via a series of interactive puzzles. Participants will have the opportunity to decipher clues, solve riddles and get that much closer to the movie with the “Inferno Journey Through Hell” interactive experience. Each week, head over to the website to solve three new puzzles boasting the circles of hell theme depicted in the movie. Using the best of Google (Google Maps, Gmail, Google Search, Google Play, Google Docs, Google Cultural Institute and YouTube) and social media, find the hidden clues and win prizes including an Italian getaway. Even better, they’ve enlisted the help of Dan Brown to create difficult puzzles that will have you wondering just how in the heck you’ll be able to solve them. “Dan Brown is a master of creating suspenseful and intellectual mysteries that are known for interweaving classic references to art and history while also using hidden codes and symbols,” Elias Plishner, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Digital Marketing for Sony Pictures Entertainment, said. “For the first time, Dan has collaborated with the studio and our partners at Google to develop an online puzzle-based challenge that is filled with his signature brand of entertainment. The ‘Inferno Journey Through Hell’ will lead fans through many fun twists and turns while also giving them the chance to win some pretty spectacular prizes.” Gameplay starts today and will continue through to the film’s release.

Comment It has been nearly a year since the Nexus 5X smartphone was launched. On Tuesday, October 4, Google is expected to announce new smartphones – and possibly more – at an event in San Francisco. The new handsets won't be branded Nexus and won't have the clean, stripped-down version of Android that Nexii owners have come to expect. So, nearly a year after doing the first review of the 5X, how well has possibly-the-last of the Nexus line held up? Full disclosure: Google loaned journalists covering the launch the handset for a year, and I've made it my main phone for the duration. The results have been largely good, except for the past month, but some failings have become apparent as well. Sticky fingers The basic hardware of the Nexus 5X has held up pretty well, helped in part by the fact that it never leaves the Speck case it came with. The white plastic backing, despite almost never seeing the light of day, has managed to pick up some ingrained dust that got into the case over the year, but still looks remarkably clean. The microphone and speaker on the front of the device have also remained unclogged by dirt and grime, despite the phone spending a lot of time in a back pocket and a seldom-cleaned backpack. Getting jumbled around with keys and pens in said sack hasn't damaged the screen at all, and the Gorilla Glass has done its job well. But the same can't be said of the screen's oleophobic coating, which has degenerated badly. Manufacturers cover the outer layer of most smartphones with a thin layer of material that repels fats and water – it differs slightly between manufacturers and Google hasn't confirmed what it uses. This stops fingers smudging the screen and gives the handset a nice slick feel, but with the Nexus 5X this covering wore off in six months or so. It's possible to strip off the protective coating using alcohol wipes, but in this case simple wear and tear has left the handset needing a clean every few days to get rid of smudge marks. There are commercial kits to replace the coating, but you'd think it would have remained intact longer on a phone designed to last for years. The same problem appears to have hit the camera house in the back of the device. Just holding the phone brings the fingers into contact with the camera, since it's just above the fingerprint sensor, and that did mean having to clean the lens before shooting. Possibly the most impressive thing about the new phone is battery life. A day's use is easily handled and, if you're careful about keeping battery saver on and apps in power-sipping mode, two full days is realistic. Add-ons The only other damage seen after a year of heavy use was to the Speck case. Frankly, you need a case with the 5X, as it's a slippery little bugger, but the rubberized fittings on the case have started to wear away or tear off in the last month or so – not Google's fault. Some wear and tear While we're on third-party kit, it's worth noting that switching to USB C, the only port supported by the 5X, is also a big shift from a usability standpoint. USB C has a number of real advances – better data rates, faster charging, and no more finding the right way up for the port – but there is a downside in availability. Google ships the phone without a cable allowing the phone to plug into older USB ports, so you're stuck with power point charging and your old kit won't work. On a road trip last Thanksgiving this quickly became a problem, not least because no electronics stores had the right cables or chargers. This is more of an issue with the newness of the connection, however stores are still not stocking much in the way of Nexus-compatible connection cables, and some of the ones you find online are downright dangerous. A Google engineer has done sterling work testing third-party cables, but the 5X does mean yet another cluster of redundant charging kit left lying around. Other than these issues the phone hasn't had a serious fault, and the battery life remained as good as ever. That is, until Nougat came along. Nasty Nougat One of the best things about a Nexus phone is that you get security and operating system updates well ahead of everyone else – typically within a week of announcement. Unsurprisingly, Google looks after its own, and receiving the monthly update from the Chocolate Factory is very reassuring. It also meant that Android Nougat came down as an update within a few weeks of it being released – a sizable download, and one that promised some major improvements. At first things looked very good. Battery life was slightly better, there were some nice editing tweaks for the interface, and apps seemed to run slightly more smoothly. However, after a month or so this changed. The battery life, once over a day, now fell down to under eight hours. At the same time, data usage went through the roof, with the operating system taking up a big volume of both battery and data. Judging from the Google support boards, this isn't an uncommon problem, with a fair few users having similar issues. Thankfully the problems weren't terminal – factory reset managed to fix the issue. But that still meant a few hours set aside to reauthenticate all the apps and get the full complement of ebooks and music back on the device. Pixel power Based on the past year, I'd stand by my review last year, finding that the Nexus 5X is a good-enough device for a decent price. It's the last of its line and on Tuesday a replacement will be announced. The Pixel line will kill off the Nexus brand, and it's widely rumored that the new phones will come without the stripped-down look for Android. Instead, a software overlay will be added – for better or worse. Certainly, the spec on the new handset looks slightly better. More RAM is going to be handy, since the 5X is at the near limit of its memory when loaded up with apps, although battery size is pretty much the same on both the old and the new units. Under the circumstances, the 5X isn't going to get dumped any time soon. The hardware is still working fine, and with a new oleophobic coating it'll be good for a year or so yet. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 61 Comments More from The Register Apple, Google auto auto woe 6 Comments Anti-theft kill switches in smartphones just got a little less creepy US peeps now get more control over tracking and remote wipes 19 Comments How Google's Project Zero made Apple refactor its kernel MacOS, iOS task threading was open to hijack 25 Comments Virtual reality is actually made of smartphones From the HoloLens to the PlayStation VR, all VR kit is descended from the first iPhone 48 Comments Google: If you think we're bad, you should take a look at Apple Ad monster whines to EC about antitrust probe into Android 41 Comments Google scraps its Project Ara modular smartphone wheeze Software-focused firm backs out of hardware idea 43 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Updated October 3, 2016 11:13AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Smartphone Pixel Nexus Android Snapdragon Mobile Tech Personal Tech Top Tech News More details about the new phones replacing Google's Nexus line have emerged just ahead of the company's big launch event tomorrow. Over the weekend, a trio of sites published -- and then unpublished -- images and product listings for Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, expected to make their debut October 4. The phone details, listed online briefly by Canadian telcos Bell and Telus and by UK retailer Carphone Warehouse, show the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL will be available in at least two colors -- black and white -- and appear positioned to compete against C Both phones will feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 processor, a 12.3-megapixel camera and 4 GB of RAM, and will be available with either 32 GB or 128 GB of storage. Both will also run Google's latest version of Android, 7.1 Nougat. Google Assistant, Fast Charging Rumors about what might replace Google's Nexus line have been circulating since earlier this year, when the company brought on board former Motorola president Rick Osterloh to lead a new hardware division. Google released its first Nexus phone in 2010, and has partnered with several different original equipment manufacturers since then. While the prematurely posted Pixel listings did not include price information for either the Pixel or Pixel XL, previous leaks have said the Pixel is likely to carry a price-tag of $649, which means the larger phone will probably cost even more. Other specs revealed for the new phones show the Pixel will have a full-HD AMOLED, Gorilla Glass 4 display and a 2,770 mAH battery, while the Pixel XL will come with a QHD AMOLED Gorilla Glass 4 display and a 3,450 mAH battery. Images published on Carphone Warehouse show the phones will also feature a reversible USB Type-C charger that supports fast charging, delivering "up to 7 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes." In addition, the images highlight the arrival of Google Assistant on the new phones. Announced at Google's I/O developers conference this past May, Google Assistant is an intelligent software persona that provides conversation-based answers and help to users. New OS or Platform Announcement? Scheduled to begin Tuesday, Oct. 4 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time, Google's livestreamed event is also expected to feature several other product announcements. Among the products likely to be unveiled are 4K Chromecast, Google's new Daydream virtual-reality viewer and Google Home, a smart-home device that's been widely compared to the Amazon Echo. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Play, also hinted at some potential new operating system news in a recent tweet. Posting on Sept. 24, Lockheimer wrote, "We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016." According to a report today on Quartz, it's possible Google could be planning to announce a "new operating system or computing platform that combines aspects of Android, its mobile operating system, and Chrome, the OS used on its netbooks."

Skype isn’t just a VoIP service. Google, Bing, and Yahoo aren’t just search engines. In fact, these are all codewords that are used by racists online in order for them to skirt censorship. You can see the full (and deeply unpleasant) list below. Racist Trump twitter has come up with a new coded way to share racial slurs w/ each other and avoid account suspension. pic.twitter.com/J4AmaHFVCd — Alex Goldman (@AGoldmund) October 1, 2016 You don’t have to search far to find people using these codewords. That said, I’m not going to share any below. I have no desire to give bigots the oxygen of attention. As Buzzfeed pointed out, the use of “Google” as a substitute for the n-word likely comes from 4chan’s Operation Google, which was a response to Google’s Jigsaw program. This is an AI-driven approach to filtering out harassment and abuse online. The participants of Operation Google wanted to trick the AI into filtering out the word “Google” by using it as a derogatory slur for black people. Skittles, on the other hand, is an obvious reference to Donald Trump Jr’s infamous tweet where he compared Syrian refugees to poisoned Skittles. This isn’t the first time the far- and alt-right have used codewords online. In June earlier this year, it was discovered that some were using triple parentheses to identify jewish people online. These triple parentheses – also called ‘echoes’ – were ultimately adopted as a symbol of defiance. Whether the same will happen here remains to be seen.

Photo / Screenshot Google is expected to announce two new phones Tuesday, but information seemingly posted early by a British retailer may have given us all a sneak peek at what's to come. All unofficial leaks, no matter where they come from, should be taken with a grain of salt. With that in mind, however, the leak from retailer Carphone Warehouse does back up a few things already suspected about the phones, according to 9 to 5 Google. (Not only that, the pages that revealed the leaks appear to have been taken down - often a sign that someone jumped the gun.) The Carphone Warehouse leak, for example, supports what we've heard about the new phone's name. For several years, Google has released phones under the "'Nexus" brand name. Rumor has it, however, that Google is ditching the Nexus name in favor of "Pixel" - a name it already uses in its Chromebook lineup for its highest-end device. According to the leak, the phones will come in two sizes. One will have a 5-inch screen (larger than the standard iPhone7), while the other will have a 5.5-inch screen (the same same size as the iPhone 7 Plus). Both are supposed to have fast-charging technology, with language on the removed site boasting that they will be able to get 7 hours of battery life out of a 15-minute charge. If true, that's certainly not too shabby. They will also reportedly have AMOLED screens, like their predecessors. That promises screens with vibrant colors and deep blacks, which also meet the specifications of Google's virtual reality project, Daydream. Continued below. Related Content Tax audits of large companies plummet Apple sued as growing number of customers complain about 'touch disease' in the iPhone 6 Gear Friday: Living with Windows 10 Both Pixel models shown on the removed site had a metal body similar to the iPhone, with two speakers that appeared to be rear-facing. Google's options come at a time when the holiday offerings for smartphones aren't looking too exciting. Between the widely criticized headphone-jack-free iPhone and the bad press around the recall of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, consumers may be looking for another option. These Pixel smartphones may not seem like anything much more extraordinary, but they will serve as the first real vessels for Google's fledgling personal assistant. In this space, Google has plenty of competition from Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. But Google's (which is just called Assistant) also has something none of those others do: the extensive suite of services baked into the Android system. Getting the assistant to work smoothly with the company's many services - Gmail, Calendar, the newly named G Suite (formerly Apps for Work), Maps, etc. - will be key to the success of Google's efforts in this area overall. And if the Pixel phones can convince the hardcore Google fans that the company's assistant should become a key part of their lives, that paves the way for others to follow in their footsteps - and gives Google a leg up in the battle to design an artificial assistant that will become everyone's constant companion. - Washington Post By Hayley Tsukayama Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

So what gives? A few days ago Google released a new mobile messaging app called Allo that seeks to insert some Amazon Echo-like smarts into a familiar chat interface. While the app appears to be doing well on the charts, some Android fans have criticized its mobile-only approach (it can’t be used on the desktop) and the fact that it can’t be used to talk to people using Hangouts, another Google messaging app. A broader criticism is Google's inability (so far) to create a single, cross-platform app that truly rivals iMessage, Apple's text and video messaging service that works across iOS and macOS. (Hangouts was close to being that all-in-one cross-platform solution until SMS support was phased out over the summer.) Over at /r/Android, a central meeting place for Android enthusiasts on Reddit, one user named Outbackroo spoke out against Google’s perceived “philosophy of throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks." A fellow denizen of /r/Android, jakemoroni, claimed that Google has "had long enough to make their ecosystem more coherent, and they have failed.” Concern is also mounting among Android enthusiasts over Google's software development cadence. "There tends to be a growing lack of faith among the Android user base that this cycle of promising-but-eventually-cancelled products won't end, and Google will remain unfocused in their approach," another Reddit user, Zekes3DGlasses, told me via email, who described the rollout of Allo and Duo (a video messaging service for mobile devices that was released in August) as "disappointing." One Android developer named Ben (he withheld his surname) told me that users merely "want a solution that works, and they want it now." Ben was less harsh on Google than his online cohorts, however, calling himself "more of a realist" and giving Google the benefit of the doubt to "keep trying until they get it right. And I believe they will get there eventually!" While Google doesn’t owe users anything, it’s clear that repeated tinkering and outright shuttering of trusted apps and services frustrates some of its most fervent admirers (RIP Google Reader). Long-term Android users also bemoan things like inconsistent visual standards (despite Google's own Material Design guidelines). What is interesting is that the very elements of Google that drew many users to their products, such as experimentation and curiosity, are the very things that are pushing some long-term Android users towards iOS. With Google's expected announcement of a new line of flagship smartphones on Tuesday, it's clear the company is making a newfound effort to compete with Apple for a hold of the US market again. Zekes3DGlasses, the Reddit user who criticized Google for its "unfocused" development cadence, is hoping for the best. “I still hope that Google can put it all together," he said. "Their product ecosystem offers such an incredible breadth of services, from email to productivity software and cloud services to streaming music, and with many of them at such a better value than competitors.” Time will tell how tomorrow's events pan out.

But it’s hoping to change that. In 2013, the Asian juggernaut stuck a Silicon Valley stake in the ground with the Institute of Deep Learning, a research center devoted to advancing the firm’s artificial intelligence efforts. Now, thanks in part to the burgeoning lab’s efforts, Baidu is debuting an app bound for the United States and beyond: TypeTalk, a third-party Android keyboard with AI-powered voice recognition. TypeTalk, which launched on the Google Play Store a few months ago and received a major update on Monday, isn’t your typical keyboard. Unlike Swype, SwiftKey, or Google Keyboard, Baidu’s effort emphasizes voice over tapping: Selecting a text field surfaces a giant, white microphone icon beneath instructions to “Speak now.” Related: Smartphone speech recognition can text three times faster than you can type “In our view, we’ve taken a voice-centric approach,” Bijit Halder, TypeTalk’s product manager, told Digital Trends. “It’s in the design. Most keyboards have a little mic button on the side, but we’ve put voice first.” That may not sound all that novel — most Android devices ship with voice-to-text capabilities, after all. But there’s more to TypeTalk than meets the eye. At the keyboard’s core is machine intelligence: a voice transcription engine known as Deep Speech. “The special ingredient [is] highly accurate speech recognition, built on Baidu’s … deep learning-based technology,” Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu and founder of Google research initiative Google Brain, said in a press release. Optimization is to thank, too. TypeTalk personalizes transcription results, tailoring word and phrase suggestions to individual users. “The more data you have, the better algorithm you have,” Halder said. “You can learn. You can improve performance.” And it adapts to surroundings: TypeTalk undertakes voice-to-text near a noisy roadside differently than transcription in a quiet cubicle. “We’re looking at use cases and [continue] to make improvements,” he said. talktype2pngMore Related: 12 Android keyboard that will have you texting faster than a 13-year-old If you’ve used Android’s built-in voice transcription, Apple’s Siri on iOS, or Cortana on Windows Phone, TypeTalk’s transcription tech will feel familiar. Tapping the microphone icon begins transcription, during which the keyboard performs a number of labor-saving features on the fly: It capitalizes words at the beginning of sentences, stops listening during periods of silence, and supports voice commands for punctuation like periods, commas, and colons. When it encounters a word in which it’s not entirely confident, an underline appears beneath it — along with a pop-up box with a list of suggestions. That last feature, error detection, is a component on which the TypeText team spent an outsized amount of development effort. The reason, Halder said, is the extent to which transcription errors can impact accuracy. “It takes time and focus [to correct an error],” he said. “Even finding the word in error is tricky, and correction takes a long time.” According to Baidu, TypeText’s transcription engine can reduce error rate by as much as 20.4 percent. Read More That’s not the only error-correcting feature TypeText sports. A two-finger gesture allows for the quick highlighting of parts of sentences — the vacant space above, below, and on either side of the microphone icon acts as a trackpad, a swipe along which highlights words and phrases in sentences. talktype1pngMore Related: Want to talk to your PC? Here’s how to enable speech to text in Windows 10 Baidu contends that TypeTalk’s features, taken together, have the potential to measurably speed up transcription. Halder pointed to a recent study published by Stanford, the University of Washington, and Baidu research that demonstrated Baidu’s voice recognition engine — the same in use with TypeTalk’s — could enable users to input text up to three times faster than, say, hunting and pecking for keys. “The average user can type about 40 to 50 words a minute on mobile, but up to 150 words a minute speaking,” Halder said. Transcription may by TypeTalk’s headlining feature, but it’s not the only labor-saving one. Baidu’s keyboard sports a full QWERTY keyboard for situations in which transcription’s impossible — one with emojis, alphanumeric keys, symbols, and support for Swype-like gestures which generate AI-powered word suggestions. And it packs what Baidu calls QuickShare, a tool that taps third-party services to supply images, search results, and other tools. Support for GIF database Giphy lets you browse and share animated movies; Yelp integration lets you search for restaurants and places; and location sharing, as you might expect, shares your current location. Related: 12 of the hottest iPhone keyboards Baidu has big plans for TypeTalk — it sees it as a “growing” product that’ll “evolve” over time. “On mobile, going forward, the focus will absolutely be speech interfaces,” Halder said. “That includes not only speech-to-text, but the whole language and AI behind it. And Baidu is committed to that as a company.” More concretely, in the next few months, Halder sees intelligent integration with third-party services. “You may be able to say, ‘Come and pick me up,’ and it’ll share your location automatically and summon a car,” he said. “That’s the future of the keyboard.” Support for Apple’s iOS, on the other hand, isn’t. That’s thanks to restrictions the latest version of the iPhone maker’s operating system, Halder said — third-party keyboards can’t access the iPhone’s microphone. “We’re interested in iOS and other means of getting that functionality, but until Apple changes its policy, support is impossible,” he said. Here’s hoping that day arrives sooner than later. What does your skin say about you?

Google’s Waze Carpool pilot expands to San Francisco-area commuters Posted Sep 29, 2016 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Innovation is in all the wrong places Google-owned Waze is slowly increasing the scope of its Bay-area commute service trial, but now the service is available via the standard Waze app for anyone who wants to sign up to be a driver, or through a separate, dedicated Waze Rider app for riders. Google is still capping trips for both riders and drivers to two rides a day, designed for the morning and evening commutes. Waze provided the following statement to TechCrunch about the progress of the Bay area program: The Waze Carpool trial has been gradually opening to new users and is currently available to commuters in the greater San Francisco Bay Area who wish to be a part of the pilot. This includes drivers who can register via the original Waze app, and riders who can request a ride via the separate Waze Rider app. More information is available at www.waze.com/carpool. Google’s approach is very different from others looking to provide ride-sharing, mainly because its design focuses on using drivers who have regular day jobs act as the key service providers, whereas Uber, Lyft and others end up attracting a lot of drivers who use driving more as a primary source of income. In fact, Waze explicitly says in its FAQ for potential drivers that pay-outs are designed more to cover costs than to result in any kind of workable income. Waze has offered Carpool in Israel since kicking off a pilot there in 2015, and it continues to operate in that country. The Bay area pilot is its first U.S.-based trial. Google’s approach is much more appropriately suited to the term “ride sharing,” since payouts to drivers are minimal, and charges to riders are even smaller. The focus here really is on collaborative consumption, and as a result drivers aren’t required to provide the kind of vehicle and background checks that Uber, Lyft and the like require before approving drivers to join the service. The goal of reducing the number of cars on the road is a noble one, especially in the dense traffic of the Bay area, but in addition to revenue it collects from matchmaking, down the road you could also see Waze Carpool paving the way for an autonomously driven carpooling network – but that’s all speculation on my part. For now, it just seems like a slightly more cost- and ecology-conscious way to get to work. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Waze Founded 2007 Overview Waze is a social traffic & navigation app based on the world's largest community of drivers sharing real time road info and contributing to the “common good” out there on the road.

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo News: The Latest Google Pixel Phone Leaks Show It All Carib Guerra last month The Latest Google Pixel Phone Leaks Show It All If you just can't wait to see the Pixel and Pixel XL, the new Google-branded smartphones expected to be announced tomorrow, you're in luck. After weeks of rumors and blurry images, a smartphone sales company called Carphone Warehouse just accidentally dropped the entire ball. The UK business accidentally set the product pages for the Pixel and Pixel XL live a couple days early, and for just long enough for them to be archived before they were taken down. The pages contained the phone's specs, but also a few slides describing its various features. For anyone familiar with the majority of smartphones launched in the last few years, Google's debut devices will be quite familiar in both specs and design. While all of the information here is subject to change until we get the official details from tomorrow's announcement, it's now all but certain that specs for the Pixel and Pixel XL will be as follows: Google Pixel Specs 2.15 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor (quad-core, 64-bit) 4 GB RAM 32 GB or 128 GB internal storage 5" Full HD AMOLED display, 441 ppi 2,770 mAh with Qualcomm Quick Charge rear camera - 12.3 MP, f/2.0, 1.55 µm front camera - 8 MP, f/2.0 Android 7.1 USB Type-C and, yes... a 3.5 mm headphone jack Google Pixel XL Spec 2.15 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor (quad-core, 64-bit) 4 GB RAM 32 GB or 128 GB internal storage 5.5" Quad HD AMOLED display, 532 ppi rear camera - 12.3 MP, f/2.0, 1.55 µm front camera - 8 MP, f/2.0 Android 7.1 USB Type-C 3.5 mm headphone jack The biggest news here is that the devices will both be running on the Snapdragon 821. As I mentioned in the rumor roundup last week, this means that the Pixel and Pixel XL will be the first devices to be fully capable of running apps designed for the Daydream VR headset, also expected to be announced tomorrow. It also means that Google's own devices are just that much better than the flagship devices launched this year by pretty much all of their partner OEMs, most of which have Snapdragon 820 chips. Beyond the specs, the archived pages also offer a look at some of the software and features that Google hopes will prove to be selling points. Among these are photo features like Smartburst, Smart Photos, and unlimited cloud storage. Unsurprisingly, both Allo and Duo, Google's recently launched messaging apps, are pictured, and show Google Assistant integrated into Allo. We also see that the devices will feature USB Type-C ports with a fast charging technology, likely Qualcomm's Quick Charge considering it comes as a standard option on the Snapdragon 800 series processors. Thanks to this technology, just a 15-minute charge provides around 7 hours of battery life. Additionally, the specs section claims that the 3,450 mAh battery (Pixel XL) will enable 26 hours of talk time and 456 hours of standby. Check out the images below for more details and stay tuned for full coverage on tomorrow's big event.

Xiaomi has finally launched its Mi Box Android TV set-top box in the U.S.  The Mi Box comes with movies and popular shows from hit streaming apps such as Netflix, HBO, Showtime, VUDU and games from Google Play. The Mi Box also offers users easy access to live TV channels including ESPN, CNN and Disney. "We are thrilled to bring Mi Box to our fans in the U.S. in collaboration with Google. This is a significant milestone for Xiaomi, as it is our first opportunity to demonstrate to consumers here in America the power of what makes Xiaomi extraordinary: our promise of innovation for everyone. We believe everyone is entitled to benefit from technological breakthroughs, and Mi Box is a reflection of that belief: an incredible entertainment experience at an unprecedented price of $69, less than the cost of a single night out for two," Hugo Barra, vice president of Xiaomi Global, said.

Credit: iStockphoto More like this Google Fiber to add urban coverage and wireless with Webpass acquisition Google Fiber puts expansion plans on hold to review strategy A Google Fiber move to wireless could keep it competitive Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware Google Fiber's strategy to use wireless technology to supplant its fiber optic cable installations came into sharper focus Monday with Google's purchase of Webpass. Google Fiber President Dennis Kish, in a blog post on the deal, noted that Webpass helps Google Fiber with its strategy "going forward [with] a hybrid approach with wireless playing an integral part. "Webpass has proven that point-to-point wireless is a reliable way to connect more people to high-speed Internet in a densely populated environment by setting up wireless transmission links between buildings," Kish added. Webpass, started in 2003, offers bandwidth of up to 1Gbps, matching the Google Fiber approach, and already has tens of thousands of subscribers in five cities: San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, Boston and Miami. Google Fiber and its competitors hope to dominate those cities for internet connectivity. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Point-to-point wireless usually refers to microwave transmissions between buildings or campus settings, which would be suitable for bringing internet service to apartment dwellers, high-rise condos and college dormitories. Google Fiber obviously hopes to lower its costs for deploying fast internet services in densely developed areas where hanging fiber cable on poles or laying it in trenches can be prohibitively expensive and a headache to city dwellers during construction. Webpass installs a data jack into a residential home or office, which completes the connection to the fixed wireless technology. In August, a report surfaced that Google Fiber would use wireless technology in a dozen cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas, while suspending projects in San Jose, Calif. and Portland, Ore. Google Fiber didn't confirm or deny that report, however. Google Fiber also has a wireless test underway in several outdoor locations in Kansas City, Mo., which relies on 3.5GHz wireless spectrum. The test was first approved by the city in April and was expected to last up to 18 months. Use of that spectrum would be shared dynamically with others under a concept called the Citizens Broadband Radio Service that was created by the Federal Communications Commission. The 3.5GHz technology being tested in Kansas City would be separate from any service made available from Webpass, at least initially. It is clear that Google Fiber wants to try to create city-wide broadband networks that will connect all sorts of devices -- smartphones, desktop computers and tablets -- to the internet from almost anywhere and at fast speeds, analysts said. Meanwhile, AT&T and Verizon, among other traditional wireless providers, are working to expand their fiber optic cable infrastructure to supplant existing 4G LTE networks, which will move to faster 5G networks by about 2020.

The update does not contain any dramatic changes save for some probable software fixes, but BlackBerry released it early before Google can even have an official announcement.  ( Maurizio Pesce | Flickr ) Advertisement BlackBerry is rolling out an October security update for the Android-powered BlackBerry Priv, ahead of Google's official release of the patch. All carrier variants or unlocked versions of the Priv will be eligible for the update except for those under Verizon. No word yet as to why Verizon is not part of the list, but expect the security patch to come to Verizon Priv devices shortly. The security update is part of BlackBerry's newest beta release for the Priv, which unfortunately did not come with a comprehensive changelog that lists all the improvements and changes to the phone. There aren't much dramatic changes to see in this update, but there's a high chance it contains general fixes and performance improvements applied by BlackBerry. We can expect to see more details about the October security patch when Google officially releases it soon. The update comes in at about 157 MB. If you own a Priv and if you're enrolled in the beta program, expect to receive the update shortly. The AT&T variant of the Priv will receive the firmware version AAG873 while remaining variants, including unlocked Priv units, will receive the firmware version AAG853. This update brings Google's latest security patch but to be clear, this does not bring Android 7.0 Nougat to the Priv. BlackBerry hasn't made any public announcement if it intends to bring Android 7.0 to its Android-powered smartphones. But it most likely will work on this, given that they have much more time for software now. A recent announcement by BlackBerry confirmed that, following a $372 million loss, it has decided to reorient and direct its focus solely on software, halting any involvement in designing and manufacturing its own hardware. "The company plans to end all internal hardware development and will outsource that function to partners," John Chen, BlackBerry's chief executive said. True to their word, BlackBerry has indeed chosen to outsource the manufacturing aspect of their most recent smartphones and instead focus solely on developing the OS. The BlackBerry DTEK50, successor to the Priv, is actually a rebranded Alcatel Idol 4, while the rumored DTEK60, BlackBerry's flagship device and successor the the DTEK50, will be a rebranded TCL 950. BlackBerry, previously named Research in Motion, once dominated the smartphone industry with their business-oriented smartphones. But with the rapid advancements in smartphone technology, the company has visibly struggled to keep up with the velocity. Still, it might be pushing for a comeback now that it's less pressured to develop and manufacture hardware. The BlackBerry Priv was the first smartphone released by BlackBerry to support Android, with the DTEK50 and DTEK60 being the second and third smartphones to support it respectively. Despite the Priv running Android, it featured a QWERTY keyboard, something that the company is renowned for. The DTEK50, however, did not feature a physical keyboard, and the DTEK60 will likely take on a similar path.

October 3, 2016 WhatMatrix Community Without much fanfare, Google introduced a new version control platform, hosted on its vast cloud. If this sounds somewhat familiar, you may be thinking of Google Code, which is now defunct. The big difference is that Google’s new Cloud Source Repositories is a git platform, which means it is a lot more flexible (and useful) than Google Code. Google Code was launched back in 2006, a couple of years before GitHub and Bitbucket appeared on the scene, quickly overtaking Google Code in popularity. Google finally pulled the plug on Google Code in March 2015, citing lack of interest. While this was the end of the road for Google Code, which fell out of favour years before it was officially pronounced dead, Google is not ditching the developer community. In fact, Google Cloud Source Repositories look rather promising, even at this early stage. Personally, I don’t expect a lot of people to ditch GitHub and transition to Google anytime soon, but the company has a way of attracting users to its services, even those that don’t look so tempting at launch. Google simply keeps pushing, polishing, innovating and offering incentives to new users. It usually works, although I am sure many of you are recalling a Google Plus joke or two right now. However, I am also sure Google is dead serious when it comes to this project. Google is taking on GitHub and Bitbucket with Cloud Source Repositories.

Veteran fans of thriller author Michael Crichton may recall that his career kicked into high gear with the 1969 release of a novel entitled “The Andromeda Strain.” The book described the impact of a deadly microbe strain delivered to earth from space via a military satellite. Tomorrow in San Francisco, Google is expected to announce the release of a new strain of operating system code-named “Andromeda.” The new OS is expected to combine elements of Chrome with Android. Unlike current efforts to bring support for Android apps into Chrome, however, the new Andromeda OS is expected to bring some of the desktop-like capabilities of Chrome into Android to form a super OS that could work across smartphones, tablets and notebook-style form factors. The development of a single Google OS is an obvious one, but its impact is bound to be profound and will cause a fair amount of stress and, yes, strain, for users, device makers and developers alike. Though details remain sketchy, the new OS is expected to offer true multi-modal windowing, as well as a file system and other typical accoutrements for a desktop-style operating system. In essence, this means that Google’s next OS — expected to be released late this year or sometime next year — will be able to compete directly with Microsoft Windows and MacOS X. On many levels, the development of a single Google OS is an obvious one. In fact, I (and many others) thought it was something the company needed to do a long time ago. Despite that, its impact is bound to be profound and cause a fair amount of stress and, yes, strain, for users, device makers and developers alike. For consumers and other end users, Andromeda will first appear as yet another OS option, because Google isn’t likely to immediately drop standalone versions of Android or Chrome OS after the announcement or release of Andromeda. Over time, as the transition to Andromeda is complete, those potential concerns will fade away, and consumers, in theory at least, should get a consistent experience across devices of all shapes and sizes. This would be a clear benefit for users, because they should have access to a single set of applications, consistent access to all their data and all the other obvious benefits of combining two choices into one. At the same time, however, the transition could end up taking several years, which is bound to cause confusion and concern for end users. Trying to choose which devices and operating systems to use, particularly as device lifetimes lengthen, could prove to be frustrating. Plus, if Google does move away from Chrome, as some have suggested, existing Chromebooks become relatively useless. The launch of a new OS with new capabilities and new hardware requirements seems like the perfect time for Google to make a serious play into its own branded devices. For device makers, Andromeda could represent an exciting new opportunity to sell new form factors, such as clamshell, convertible or detachable notebooks running the new OS. They may also be able to create true “pocket computers” that come in a smartphone form factor, but offer support for desktop monitors and other peripherals, similar to Microsoft’s Continuum feature for Windows 10 Mobile. Initially, however, Andromeda is going to be more of a challenge for device makers because of their need to deal with product categories like Chromebooks, that could potentially go away. Plus, like Microsoft, Google seems to be moving aggressively toward doing its own branded hardware products, and that takes away potential market opportunities for some of its partners. At the same time, the launch of a new OS with new capabilities and new hardware requirements seems like the perfect time for Google to make a serious play into their own branded devices. For developers, Andromeda will undoubtedly prove to be a strain for a longer period of time because of their likely need to rewrite or at least rework their applications to take full advantage of the new features and capabilities that will inevitably come with a new OS. Plus, any confusion that consumers face about which version of the different Google OSes to use will negatively impact future app sales and, potentially, development. The launch of a new OS from a major industry player is always fraught with potential concerns, but the merger of two existing options (including the most widely used OS in the world) into a single new one heightens those concerns exponentially.

By Roy Choi | October 3, 2016 Part of: Pixel Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Google is ready to unveil its new Android smartphones and will ditch the Nexus name for Pixel. We already know a lot about the smartphones so, at this point, it seems like that part of the event is just going to be a formality. “World, meet Pixel. Pixel, World.” If the rumors are to be believed we can expect to 5-inch and 5.5-inch versions of the phone with Full HD and QHD displays, respectively. 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, 12-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front-facing, with either a Snapdragon 820 or 821 processor. Of course, there’s so much more than just the smartphones. What's the deal with Pixel? Mobile Google Pixel and Pixel XL event: Here’s what to expect We may even get a look at a bunch of new products including Google Home (Google’s answer to Amazon Echo), a new router, VR/AR hardware, 4K Chromecast and more. Google may even discuss Project Andromeda, its rumored Chrome OS/Android hybrid operating system. It should make for a busy, jam-packed event. Bookmark this page and join us Tuesday, October 4, 2016 at 9 AM PT/12PM ET for the Google Pixel event. 5 PM BST (London) 12 PM EDT (New York) 11 AM CDT (Chicago) 9 AM PDT (Local) 1 AM JST (Tokyo) – Wednesday, October 5, 2016* Live Blog Google Pixel event Topics #Google #Google #pixel Pixel Updates 18 Google Pixel outsells Nexus 6P in first week, report claims November 3 17 Google Pixel and Pixel XL top 5 features: Google Assistant, Daydream and more!

But beyond marketing hype and anticipation, analysts too are tuning their financial forecasts for the event’s immediate resonance, and more importantly for the ripple effects beyond that… Jefferies analysts, in a note published earlier today, mentioned the new products expected to give the firm a significant boost that will breathe new life into its ecosystem of apps and services; a move so important that it seemingly made them set a monstrously high stock target of $1,000 for Google’s parenting company Alphabet. Considering that their previous price target was $804, that’s quite a significant jump, especially given that GOOG class C stocks are currently trading at about $770. Tomorrow could truly prove to be a watershed moment in Google‘s history, and certainly one that will make us learn what the company’s vision for the future (its own as well as, arguably, the industry as a whole) is. From the the Jefferies’ note: On Oct 4 Google is expected to unveil a slew of new devices designed to showcase and drive usage of its best-in-class software services. Among the expected announcements: two new flagship smartphones designed to directly compete with the iPhone, a strategically important Bluetooth speaker that responds to voice commands, a new Chromecast audio / video streaming device, and a new OS called Andromeda, which will merge Chrome with Android.

Early Posting Leaks Pictures, Specs Of New Google Pixel Phone Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Early Posting Leaks Pictures, Specs Of New Google Pixel Phone October 3, 2016 2:19 pm EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc oops google alphabet google pixel leaks Home isn’t the only new product Google will be launching this week. Joining it is the new, long-awaited Pixel phone. Except thanks to an “oops” on one retailer’s site, the wait for news ended a bit early. As Ars Technica points out, one phone retailer site based in the U.K. seems to have had a brief slip of the finger, and let listings for the new device go live today… even though it won’t actually be formally announced until Oct. 4. Tech sites across the board seem pretty certain that the Pixel is the new Nexus. Instead of following up the Nexus 5 and 6 series with something 7, Google’s dumping the Nexus name altogether and launching the first Pixel phone. The Pixel phone — which also comes in a Pixel XL, slightly larger version — is not to be confused with the Pixel C. That item, already for sale, is a tablet-with-keyboard device basically in direct competition with Microsoft’s Surface tablet and Apple’s iPad pro. In addition to dumping the Nexus name, Google appears to have dumped LG and Huawei, the manufacturers behind their older line. The new phones come from HTC, and earlier leaks have suggested they will feature premium materials and full-body aluminum cases. And premium design, of course, comes with a premium price point; the new phones are expected to start around $650, putting them right in line with Samsung and Apple’s flagship high-end smartphone products. The screen will measure 5″, like the Nexus 5, but the Pixel XL will clock in at 5.5″ — slightly smaller than the Nexus 6P, and exactly in line with the iPhone 7 Plus. The leak listed some detailed product specs including processor speed and potential for an SD card slot, but Ars cautions readers to take those with a grain of salt, as they contradict other, more-likely leaks (and existing processor specs). Most entertainingly, however, the leaky listing came with a whole gallery full of pictures. The photos show that, like the Nexus line before it, the Pixel keeps its fingerprint sensor on the back, instead of on the home key. It also clearly comes with a USB-C port and prominently-placed speaker on the bottom next to it. But where Google shines with its own home-grown products is the software. The Pixel will launch with Android 7.1 (Nougat) installed, much as the Nexus line of phones were first to receive this year’s earlier launch of Android 7. It also seems to come with Google Allo — a fancier, bot-using, media-sharing, Facebook Messenger-challenging, Hangouts-replacing app — pre-installed and foregrounded. While lots of specs have been leaked before, though, the photos were new. A sampling: Ars Technica has a gallery of the full set, for the truly impatient. For those willing to wait, though, Google’s big event is expected at noon Eastern / 9 a.m. Pacific tomorrow.

A recent report from Android Police sheds light on the matter. Drawing from a conversation with a source “familiar with Huawei’s operations” the report offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Huawei and Google’s slightly tumultuous relationship and the events that led up to the OEM passing up what could’ve been a golden opportunity. 6P collaboration didn’t meet expectations According to the source, the Nexus 6P, despite being well-reviewed, fell far short of Huawei’s expectations. Initially, Google had sold Huawei on the concept of producing its flagship device by suggesting that it would be sold by all four major carriers, providing a powerful entry into the U.S. market for the Chinese manufacturer. It was also reportedly planned that the two brands would embark on a multi-hundred million dollar ad campaign, with each side matching the other’s investment. Neither of these things ended up happening, of course. Google’s talks with carriers broke down, and the 6P and LG-made 5X never made it to the shelves of a major US carrier — though it did make it to all three major Canadian telecoms in November 2015. Shortly after that slightly disappointing launch, Google approached Huawei about producing its 2016 smartphone portfolio, according to the source, which at that time included a third device that was later nixed. However, Google came to the table with one hard-and-fast requisite: the devices would feature only Google branding. Apparently, Huawei’s global CEO Richard Yu then ended negotiations immediately, and HTC ended up winning the bid.

Apparently, Huawei’s global CEO Richard Yu then ended negotiations immediately, and HTC ended up winning the bid. Huawei’s North American future The irony is that unlike the 6P, the Pixel devices will likely be sold at all major U.S. carriers. Manufacturing the device could have been a major building block for Huawei, which is still struggling to make a successful entrance into the North American market. In fact, things have been in flux according to the source, with much of the company’s Honor U.S. team being fired following poor sales reception to the Honor 8 smartphone. Additionally, a planned Huawei has been pushed back pending the release of Android Wear 2.0 and the Mate 9 handset is expected to be revealed in Germany, indicating the U.S. won’t be a prime demographic. However, it’s not all bad news. According to the source, the relationship between Google and Huawei “remains strong,” with the two companies continuing to pursue projects together. In particular, Huawei is reportedly being solicited by Google to produce a mid-range device for the second half of 2017.

Huawei made a great solid phone that had a premium feel. HTC better step up on this one John W HTC phones have always been very nice but tend to be a little bit bulkier, by the look of the leaks this one is no different. norsem4n Is it because the NSA didn’t want HUAWEI devices on US carriers? Brian Your question is illogical. The 6P is clearly stated in this article as being made by Huawei. You can also buy any number of other Huawei, and numerous other Chinese brands, in the US. Andrew English True but they might be under strict enforcement by the US Government who has been known to tell other companies and states to not do business with Huawei in the past. Even it’s known that Obama has called the decision makes who decided to use Huawei and tell them NO, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. coolspot Huawei does business everywhere else in the world with no major issues. The ban in the United States is less so about security and more so about protectionism. Brian My Honor 5x with a custom ROM (SlimRom), despite being a $250 phone with mediocre specs, still runs circles around a lot of my peers expensive mid-range and high-end devices. With the CM community picking up a lot of the development for these Chinese phones with decent hardware specs it’s hard to justify spending so much on a smartphone nowadays, Google-branded or not. Iz3man I was a “buy the best who cares the price” kinda guy.. Then I bought a new motorcycle and my phone became a ” as long as it rings and emails” device. I just bought a 6p and plan on exploiting everything the XDA and cm Dev’s can dish out. These phones now a days are way too powerful. Most are even more powerful then laptops. If everyone would just use their devices to their maximum, maybe we would see a realistic levelling of the price ranges. Except apple, those die hards will buy what ever it is as long as the name ends with either an ‘S’ or a higher number. Andrew English I am surprised the Chinese Government funded company Huawei passed up on the deal. St. Misery Here’s a thought on how huawei can break into the NA market: by changing their crappy name. No one knows how to pronounce it and it has zero brand value anyway. When I hear that name I think of cheap Chinese knockoffs. Can’t Fix Stupid I know….Huapple. John W HulaHoop Iz3man I always pronounce it as “WhoWhy” gommer strike That’s coming to the table with way too far-fetched of a demand(no branding except Google’s). Maybe they were hoping to aim high and get the mid-point, but still…Google’s starting to throw their weight around just a tiny bit too far. Is there anything wrong with the company logo on the back? I think that’s totally fine. Iz3man I was going to say my 6p only has nexus.. Then I busted out my microscope and found Huawei at the bottom. gommer strike yeah. That’s what I’m saying. It’s not intrusive at all. You barely even see it! So I dunno why Google had to go in there and say no branding. monsterduc1000 I can get a brand new dual sim international LG g5 $588 shipped to my door from Expansys. Worth it? (I simply cannot give up my plan with Telus as it is $58 a month with 6gb and ten faves, grandfathered in for about 4 years now :D, comparable plan is around $120). I’ve done a ton of research on it and it is a very capable phone with a very good camera (not s7 quality though) and the nougat update is coming in December, but I guess it is hit and miss with production quality… Some are good, but some have screen bleed and a gap where the bottom module pops in, but other than that, it is reviewed as one of the smoothest and fastest Android experiences, and in comparison videos, is always at the top, or very near vs the htc 10 and Samsung s7, which are both much more expensive at this time to buy outright. Thoughts? Iz3man Yes. Anything that saves you money on the plan and keeps is out of those bastards pockets is a plus. What do you have now. Have you considered rooting and roms? I was planing on updating my Note 4 to the Note 5, but the lack of everything turned me to rooting a roms. I’d still be on it if it didn’t die by suicide.. (3 storey fall, just jumped out of my pocket down the whole stair well..you never see the signs until it’s too late 🙁 ) Also side note, anyone else notice the g5 isn’t on Bell’s site anymore..? monsterduc1000 I had a Nexus 6 which I loved until i dropped it, with the case on… and the screen cracked and the screen stopped working completely. $300 to fix… Amoled screens are ridiculously pricey to fix. Don’t ever drop your phone if it has an amoled screen… Thankfully I kept my old Sammy Note 2 as it is working fine as a backup for now. I used to root and rom with my first couple Androids, but then I just got tired of it got out of it. Mo Dabbas The only thing I would make sure is the compatibility with LTE bands here. Lots of Asian and European phones may not work with LTE frequencies of canadian carriers. I tried the phone, I wasn’t bothered by the gap to be honest. but I felt it more fragile compared to other phones, probably due to the modular design. It is a smooth phone, one of the fastest I’ve tried so far. Battery is one thing that I didn’t like, it’s not that great compared to other offerings out there. monsterduc1000 It is compatible with Telus (who I’m with) lte bands. Expansys has a chart that shows you who it is compatible with which is nice. I’m not a huge power user so battery isn’t hugely important, especially when I can just swap a charged on in so easily if I need to with the g5. As for being fragile, that is a concern as the nexus 6 was a pretty solid phone and an off angle drop turned it useless… Pingback: Huawei was supposed to build the the Google Pixel phones, but… | MediaKita.CO.ID() Iz3man This is my second nexus and my first Huawei hand set and I’m totally sold on them. I’m kinda bummed out that they won’t be making a new nexus and more so the Google device will be an HTC (me and HTC don’t get along.. ). Mind you I’ll be happy with this 6p for a few years, maybe Google we think again and axe the pixie and bring back the Huawei new us for 2018 😀 Mo Dabbas There is actually more into this. From what I think is going on with Google, a Nexus brand is something that is a collaboration between two companies (google and another OEM). Eventually the OEM gets the product that is also theirs (as well as google’s). A Pixel brand is something where google leads and another manufacturer provides the parts. I think that’s why there are no HTC Brandings on the phones, they’re google phones and HTC provided the parts. Kinda like the pixel tablet doesn’t have whatever company provided the parts. For Huawei, that’s kinda not very beneficial in their quest to penetrate other markets (and probably the possible income was not to what they wanted) so they probably didn’t agree on the terms of the offer. For HTC, a company that is desperate for some income, google would be able to lead them to whatever hardware choices google wants. That’s what I think is going on with the whole naming thing and choice of HTC.

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | October 3, 2016 -- 18:03 GMT (11:03 PDT) | Topic: Hardware (Image: Xiaomi) China smartphone giant Xiaomi launched its Android-based Mi Box set-top box in the US on Monday, taking on the Apple TV, Roku, and other competitors with 4K streaming support and Google voice search for $69. Hugo Barra, former Google executive and current global VP for Xiaomi, made the announcement on Twitter, marking China-based Xiaomi's first product entry into the US market. The Mi Box is based on Android TV 6.0 with voice control and Google Cast support. It's also capable of streaming 4K video at 60 FPS with support for Dolby Digital Plus audio playback. In addition, there's HDMI 2.0a compatibility, a quad-core ARM processor, Mali 450 GPU, 2GB of RAM, and 8GB of storage. Gallery: Xiaomi launches in the US with $69... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 7 NEXT PREV Not available in the US market is Xiaomi's game pad controller with dual-motor vibration feedback and a 3-axis G sensor. The game pad also comes with 365-day standby battery. Included with the $69 box is Xiaomi's wireless remote with Bluetooth capability. Barra told Bloomberg in August that Xiaomi is planning to enter the US smartphone market in the near future, signaling a push outside its home market of China. "The US is a market that we definitely have in our sights," Barra said on Bloomberg Television. "We will lead with social media, with the channels that allow us to get in touch with the young generation that are enthusiastic about new technology. We are definitely going there." Barra said on Monday the Mi Box will be available from Walmart later this month.

Register for an Exam Today> Pixel Phone Details Leaked Ahead of Google's Big Oct. 4 Event By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 03 2016 More details about the new phones replacing Google's Nexus line have emerged just ahead of the company's big launch event tomorrow. Over the weekend, a trio of sites published -- and then unpublished -- images and product listings for Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, expected to make their debut October 4. The phone details, listed online briefly by Canadian telcos Bell and Telus and by UK retailer Carphone Warehouse, show the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL will be available in at least two colors -- black and white -- and appear positioned to compete against C Both phones will feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 processor, a 12.3-megapixel camera and 4 GB of RAM, and will be available with either 32 GB or 128 GB of storage. Both will also run Google's latest version of Android, 7.1 Nougat. Google Assistant, Fast Charging Rumors about what might replace Google's Nexus line have been circulating since earlier this year, when the company brought on board former Motorola president Rick Osterloh to lead a new hardware division. Google released its first Nexus phone in 2010, and has partnered with several different original equipment manufacturers since then. While the prematurely posted Pixel listings did not include price information for either the Pixel or Pixel XL, previous leaks have said the Pixel is likely to carry a price-tag of $649, which means the larger phone will probably cost even more. Other specs revealed for the new phones show the Pixel will have a full-HD AMOLED, Gorilla Glass 4 display and a 2,770 mAH battery, while the Pixel XL will come with a QHD AMOLED Gorilla Glass 4 display and a 3,450 mAH battery. Images published on Carphone Warehouse show the phones will also feature a reversible USB Type-C charger that supports fast charging, delivering "up to 7 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes." In addition, the images highlight the arrival of Google Assistant on the new phones. Announced at Google's I/O developers conference this past May, Google Assistant is an intelligent software persona that provides conversation-based answers and help to users. New OS or Platform Announcement? Scheduled to begin Tuesday, Oct. 4 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time, Google's livestreamed event is also expected to feature several other product announcements. Among the products likely to be unveiled are 4K Chromecast, Google's new Daydream virtual-reality viewer and Google Home, a smart-home device that's been widely compared to the Amazon Echo. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Play, also hinted at some potential new operating system news in a recent tweet. Posting on Sept. 24, Lockheimer wrote, "We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016." According to a report today on Quartz, it's possible Google could be planning to announce a "new operating system or computing platform that combines aspects of Android, its mobile operating system, and Chrome, the OS used on its netbooks."

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Leaked Google Pixel listings confirm specs ahead of launch Leaked Google Pixel listings confirm specs ahead of launch By Ryan Whitwam on October 3, 2016 at 12:57 pm Comment It’s the time of year when Google announces its annual in-house phone release, but something is very different this time. For nearly six years, we’ve had Nexus phones from Google as a showcase of what Android can be when device makers don’t muck around with it. This time, all signs point to an expansion of the Pixel brand in place of Nexus. Two Pixel phones are expected to be announced tomorrow at the October 4th event, and a UK retailer has accidentally dropped spec sheets and images for the devices. There have been a few leaks of the Pixel phones thus far, but none of them have been as detailed as the new leak from Carphone Warehouse. The listing pages that went live over the weekend (now removed) will likely be the same ones that go up for consumers to pre-order devices in the coming days. They confirm a lot of details that were only based on rumors previously. In case you haven’t been paying attention, there will be two Pixel phones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. The regular Pixel will have a 5-inch 1080p AMOLED display, and the Pixel XL will have a larger 5.5-inch 1440p AMOLED. Other than the size differences, these devices will be virtually identical, as confirmed by the specs on Carphone Warehouse. The Pixel phones will run the brand new Snapdragon 821 SoC, 4GB of RAM, 12.3MP cameras with optical stabilization, and 32/128GB of storage. The Pixel has a 2770mAh battery and the XL bumps it up to 3450mAh. And yes, they’ll have headphone jacks (strange you need to specify that these days) and a rear-facing fingerprint sensor. These should be the first phones to ship with the Snapdragon 821, which was announced by Qualcomm in July. Google’s phones don’t usually debut new hardware, but that’s only one of the reasons these phones are unusual. The Pixels are being manufactured by HTC (based on FCC filings and rumors), but the Carphone Warehouse listings confirm that there’s zero mention of HTC — no logos, no branding, not even a note in the specs. Although, the design of these phones does appear to have some clear similarities to recent HTC devices like the One A9 and HTC 10. Google is taking full control of the Pixel brand, and going after other premium phones like the iPhone and Galaxy S7. The leaked listings also confirm one more important detail — the Pixels will launch with Android 7.1 Nougat. The 7.0 variant of Nougat just started rolling out to Nexus devices, and the LG V20 has launched in Korea running it. We don’t have all the details on what Android 7.1 will include in general, but on the Pixels it will come bundled with an updated home screen UI, Google Assistant integration, and unlimited photo backup via Google Photos. One thing missing from the Carphone Warehouse listings was a confirmation of pricing. The consensus is that Google will charge more for these phones than most of the recent Nexus devices. Rumors have pointed to a $650 starting price for the Pixel, though there may be financing available.

Google’s goal with this change is to make it easier for people to find the most current Google news in one place: “The Keyword is all the stuff we had across 19 blogs, in one place — so you don’t have to hop from one blog to another to find the latest update. If you’re looking for something from Google from now on, chances are it’s here.” As Google’s products and services change over time, so will The Keyword, with information about new technologies being added to the blog as they are released. Alternatively, if you would rather zero in on one topic you still have that option. Go to Menu > Topics and you’ll see a full list of topics contained on the blog. It’s also possible to isolate news about specific products by going to Menu > Products. If there’s any difficulty finding what you’re looking for, you can use the search bar and filter results by either product, topics, or dates. In addition to this major change, the new Google blog has also overhauled its design with bigger images, videos, and slideshows. On the homepage, you’ll also find a section which displays the latest tweets from Google. A hat tip goes to Alex Chitu for noticing Google abandoned Blogger and uses a new blogging platform for The Keyword.

To explain why, federal officials point to two facts: (1) some 35,000 people died in crashes on U.S. roads last year, and (2) human error was to blame more than 90 percent of the time. They say one remedy might be to let computers take the wheel. The prospect of automating your commute has attracted companies like Uber — whose experimental cars in Pittsburgh still feature human backup drivers — and “stealth” tech startups, along with heavyweights like Volkswagen, Nissan and Mercedes Benz. Fifteen companies already have permits to test self-driving cars on California’s roads. You might spot one in the wild today. The Mercedes Benz F 015 self-driving car at the top of Conzelman Road on the morning of March 3, 2015. (Kelvin Yap) “It’s now clear that the next decade is going to be defined by the automation of the automobile,” Ford CEO Mark Fields declared at a recent press conference in Palo Alto. Fields was announcing the iconic carmaker’s plan to mass-produce a fully driverless car – one with no steering wheel and no pedals. He claims such machines will be on the road in the next five years. “Ready or not, they’re coming,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said this summer. “And the choice we have in government is to either act, or react.” In September, federal regulators released some much-anticipated guidelines for carmakers, governing crucial questions like car safety, cyber-security and ethics. Government officials want to head off an emerging state-by-state patchwork of laws that could hamper new technology in the long run. ‘The Elephant in the Room’ Not that auto-automation isn’t here already. Higher-end cars you can buy today boast features like “lane-keeping,” to keep your car centered in its lane on the highway, and adaptive cruise control, which adjusts to the speed of traffic around you. People are already abusing these, too — an online video shows a car steering itself down the highway as its driver climbs into the backseat. One entitled ‘Invisible Driver Prank In A Tesla!’ catches the reactions of passing motorists, dumbfounded as the seemingly empty car drives itself along an interstate highway. Tesla’s autopilot feature attained some infamy after a fatal incident on a Florida highway in May. Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old man from Ohio, died when neither he nor his Model S braked before driving under an 18-wheeler. (Tesla has since released a software update that company co-founder Elon Musk says likely would’ve prevented the crash.) Speaking to a hotel ballroom full of engineers and policy experts in San Francisco this summer, Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, referred to the incident as “the elephant in the room.” ‘If we wait for perfect, we’ll be waiting for a very, very long time.’Mark Rosekind, Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin. Rosekind wouldn’t reveal details of an investigation, but said, “No one incident will derail the Department of Transportation and NHTSA from its mission to improve safety on the roads by pursuing new, life-saving technologies.” He went on to argue that “perfect” should not be the enemy of the good when it comes to roadway safety. “We should be desperate for new tools that will helps us save lives,” Rosekind told his audience. “If we wait for perfect, we’ll be waiting for a very, very long time.” Still, a precise definition of what “safe enough” will mean for self-driving cars is elusive. A teenager can qualify for a driver’s license by passing a quick road test, but machines will be held to a higher standard. CREDIT: (Teodros Hailye/KQED) CREDIT: (Teodros Hailye/KQED) ‘Driving Better Than I Would’ “We saw how hard it is to keep people engaged in the driving task,” says Sarah Hunter, head of policy at X, formerly Google X. “They get switched off,” she says. “They find it very hard to focus on something they’re not actually meant to be doing.” Google already has more than 50 experimental self-driving cars on the road . Some are two-seat prototypes that look like something a cartoon mouse might roll up in, whereas the one I rode in was a white Lexus outfitted with sensors; they suggest a car that’s wearing Google Glass. These vehicles feature cameras that can see what color a traffic light is, and measure the distance to objects using radar and lidar (light detection and ranging). All this data from lasers and sensors is integrated with highly precise maps, to give the car a detailed sense of what’s going on around it. The result, seen on a laptop screen inside, resembles a vibrant, highly distracting update of Frogger, the arcade game in which success is achieved by crossing traffic without dying. Such cars also feature a cartoonishly large, red button in the console. A quick way to shut off self-driving mode is required in California for companies testing such vehicles, along with $5 million in insurance coverage, though restrictions are already starting to loosen up. Governor Jerry Brown just signed a bill permitting test vehicles to roll without steering wheels or pedals. My adventure in Google’s car comprised a quick jaunt around the block in Mountain View. In the driver’s seat, Karen Isgrigg kept her hands inches from the steering wheel in case she needed to take over. She says occasionally the car will act strangely — say by lightly braking at unexpected moments — but then it turns out the computer is sensing something Isgrigg doesn’t see, like someone running a red light, and is responding prudently. Google has more than fifty experimental self-driving cars on the road. About half are like this one – a modified Lexus RH450H – while the rest are small prototype test vehicles that don’t have steering wheels. (Daniel Potter) “The car is driving better than I would as a human being,” she says. This, in a nutshell, is Google’s objective, though it may come about gradually, like preparing a human student driver. “You start them out in familiar, calmer environments first,” says Hunter, “slowly introducing them to more complex places like a local mall before allowing them onto the freeway or into the city.” That could happen in perhaps three years, she told me. But it may be 30 years before self-driving cars can go anywhere in the world, mastering more sophisticated driving challenges, such as icy roads or interpreting hand motions from crossing guards. Moral Judgments In late September, federal regulators released 116 pages of guidelines on self-driving cars. While these will eventually become rules, for now they hinge on industry cooperation. They’re intended to be updated annually, though even that pace may seem glacial, next to technology that can change with the download of a new software patch. The guidelines ask carmakers to make their case with a fifteen-point safety assessment, including how self-driving cars will sense and respond to surrounding vehicles, where they’re intended to operate, how they’re being tested, and how they’ll protect data and safeguard against hackers. Self-driving cars will be expected to act morally, just like the rest of us. There’s also a section on ethics, because self-driving cars will be expected to act morally, just like the rest of us. Let’s say you’re cruising down the street when a kid runs out from behind a tree. You have only a second to react, swerving into a parked truck. Within that second, you’ve made a moral judgment, choosing the lesser of two “evils.” Or, say you’d like to give a cyclist some breathing room as you pass on the left, but doing so means illegally crossing a double-yellow line. In scenarios like these, self-driving cars will do as their programmers have instructed — and their actions may carry moral and legal consequences. The advent of self-driving cars could have ripple effects throughout society, according to Ryan Jenkins, a philosophy professor who explores the ethics of emerging technologies at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. One is that there’s no guarantee they’ll reduce congestion. Say you’re working late and decide to send your self-driving car to pick up your kid before it doubles back by the office for you, for instance. A Chevy Volt with self-driving car technology in front of KQED. (Teodros Hailye/KQED) “It’s not obvious that it’s going to reduce the total number of trips that are taken,” says Jenkins, “and some people think it might not reduce the total number of cars on the road.” He also noted that thousands of people await transplants of vital organs each year — of which fatal car crashes are a leading source. “If we reduce by ten thousand or twenty thousand the number of people who are killed in car crashes, we’re going to reduce the number of donor organs. This might mean that more people die waiting for organ donations,” he said. There are other concerns. If your self-driving car causes a wreck, you might blame the people who programmed it. This shift in liability stands to shake up the insurance industry. It’s also conceivable that trusting technology to the point that our own driving skills deteriorate could make us humans even less reliable in the driver’s seat. Jenkins calls this effect “skill-rot.” “Those are the kinds of second- and third- and fourth-order effects that I think society should be thinking about and trying to prepare for,” he says. Can We Get There From Here? While many are bullish on self-driving cars becoming widespread over the next few years, not everyone concedes that such a future is just over the horizon. Take Ford’s projection that it will be mass-producing cars with no steering wheel by 2021. “I think statements like that raise expectations beyond what the reality is likely to be,” says Steve Shladover, a research engineer at UC Berkeley. “I expect that they will have something out on the road by 2021,” he speculates, “but it will probably be something that provides very limited functionality in very limited geographical space, within a very limited speed range.” One reason Shladover cites for skepticism is the car industry’s decades-long history of overpromising such technologies.  Another is this: It’s really hard to prove that driverless cars can navigate the road as safely as humans can. “Human drivers today are way better than we give them credit for,” Shladover says. “They’re not perfect, but they’re pretty damn close to perfect, when you think of how long they drive, on average, between serious crashes.” There is another option for saving lives on the road. We could just try spending less time in the cars we have right now. “The traffic safety statistics showed big improvement during the recession,” Shladover says, “because people were driving less.” Music in this story from Launch Patterns for the Space Age Girl by LowLiFi.

Slavis Translations JustJake ““Ready or not, they’re coming,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said this summer. “And the choice we have in government is to either act, or react.” Excuse me… they aren’t coming unless the government allows them to operate. How about some actual awareness of the challenges of infrastructure and laws, rather than Foxx as a goofy cheerleader. He is soon to be dismissed as Transportation Secretary in any case, so move along already. DFinMA Give ’em a green light once they’re safer than people drivers. sstanley I’m FAR more worried about the idiot drivers than the driverless car. BRING IT ON!!!! farazs I don’t quite follow the point about organ donation. Is a life saved by a donated organ somehow worth more than one saved by avoiding a car-crash?

Built with technology from Google, audiences who solve the puzzles will have the chance to win a grand prize trip to Italy befitting of Tom Hanks‘ Langdon himself. Inferno, director Ron Howard‘s third big screen Brown adaptation, arrives from Columbia Pictures and Imagine Entertainment and will be released in theaters nationwide on October 28. RELATED: Tom Hanks Returns as Robert Langdon in the New Inferno Trailer Each week, Inferno Journey Through Hell players can go to Inferno-movie.com to find three new puzzles themed to the circles of hell as depicted in Dante’s Inferno. Finding clues hidden throughout Google products (Google Maps, Gmail, Google Search, Google Play, Google Docs, Google Cultural Institute and YouTube), and the world’s most popular social platforms, players will complete up to three puzzles each week and will have the opportunity to win weekly prizes, culminating in one grand prize – an Italian getaway with stops in Rome, Milan, Florence and Venice. As each new set of puzzles are unveiled week-to-week, the experience will become increasingly difficult to solve as the Inferno Journey Through Hell progresses to its ultimate mind-bending final challenge. “Dan Brown is a master of creating suspenseful and intellectual mysteries that are known for interweaving classic references to art and history while also using hidden codes and symbols,” says Elias Plishner, Executive Vice President of Worldwide Digital Marketing for Sony Pictures Entertainment. “For the first time, Dan has collaborated with the studio and our partners at Google to develop an online puzzle-based challenge that is filled with his signature brand of entertainment. The ‘Inferno Journey Through Hell’ will lead fans through many fun twists and turns while also giving them the chance to win some pretty spectacular prizes.” “I’m excited to bring together the technology of Google and the code-breaking elements of the Robert Langdon series,” adds Brown. “The experience allows audiences to bring Robert Langdon’s world to life by deciphering puzzles and utilizing online tools at their fingertips.” “One of the reasons why the Robert Langdon books and movies are so much fun is that the audience has the chance to solve the puzzles as he does,” says Ron Howard. “That’s why I’m so excited about this promotion – it brings Inferno to life. With the puzzles that the studio and Dan have created, powered by Google, you have the opportunity to experience what it’s like to be Robert Langdon.” “We are always glad to see our products being used in clever, compelling and engaging ways,” says Alex Angeledes, Industry Director for Media & Entertainment at Google. “Sony Pictures has given fans unique ways of discovering the depth and complexity of this film in ways that appeal to modern moviegoers.” Inferno finds famous Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) on a trail of clues tied to the great Dante himself. When Langdon wakes up in an Italian hospital with amnesia, he teams up with Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), a doctor he hopes will help him recover his memories. Together, they race across Europe and against the clock to foil a deadly global plot. The third film in the franchise that launched with The Da Vinci Code in 2006, which brought in over $758 million at the worldwide box office, and continued with Angels & Demons in 2009, Inferno has Hanks reprising his role as Langdon opposite Oscar nominee Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) as Dr. Sienna Brooks, Irrfan Khan (Life of Pi) as Harry Sims (also known as The Provost), Omar Sy (The Intouchables) as Christoph Bruder, Sidse Babett Knudsen (“Borgen”) as Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey, the head of the World Health Organization, and Ben Foster (Lone Survivor) as the film’s chief villain.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Yikes, there seems to be a lot of confusion about the rumors surrounding Google’s event tomorrow. It stems from a report in the Financial Times over the weekend that was written under the title “Google set to launch branded smartphones.” That much is true, but it doesn’t mean that Google is building its own devices, which seems to have been mentioned in plenty of, I suspect accidentally, misleading headlines. I think some of the confusion may have stemmed out of the Financial Times‘ note that Google is launching “the first smartphones that carry its own brand and design.” That’s not really true, though the brand is indeed changing. The news outlet correctly notes that this isn’t the first time Google has ventured into hardware, at least. Google, as far as we know at this point, is going to announce two new smartphones dubbed the Pixel and Pixel XL. They might be sold as “Google” smartphones, using the Pixel branding, but they aren’t built by Google any more than other phones that the company has sold, or any more than Apple “builds” its own smartphones. Word on the street – and it seems nearly confirmed at this point – is that HTC built Google’s new smartphones. That, too, isn’t new. HTC built the very first Android phone, in fact, the G1, which was dubbed a “Google phone” of sorts at the time. Google’s Lary Page and Sergey Brin actually rollerbladed into a T-Mobile press event in New York City to help launch that device. HTC also built the original Nexus One, the first real “Google phone,” if you want to call it that, though other manufacturers, including Samsung, Huawei and LG, have carried the torch since then. What we’re seeing now is a transition of branding from Nexus to Pixel, perhaps as Google continues to try to attract consumers to its devices. But, and I may be corrected tomorrow, I don’t think it’s really more than that. We might not hear that HTC built the Google Pixel and Pixel XL as often as we heard that Huawei built the Nexus 6P or LG built the Nexus 5X, for example, and it’s possible, perhaps even plausible, that HTC won’t sell them directly to consumers. It’s also possible Google had more control over these devices than it did in the past; in fact, rumor has it Huawei backed out of building the devices for this very reason. But the phones aren’t built by Google, they’re built, almost certainly, by HTC. What might seem like a huge shift on the surface actually probably won’t mean much to consumers. Until now, we’ve called Google’s smartphones “Nexus” devices. If, in a few weeks time, we’re instead simply calling them “Pixel” devices, then what has really changed?

It was revealed by Xiaomi itself. This Xiaomi Mi Box was shown to the world (again) today by former Google exec and current Global VP of Xiaomi, Hugo Barra. The Mi Box is Xiaomi’s first U.S. product. Their first product that’ll be released and available for sale inside the United States at stores within the United States, that is to say. This device may very well be the first real store-ready competitor to the dominant Android TV product on the market: NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV. Xiaomi’s Mi Box doesn’t compete on the high end that NVIDIA’s device commands. Instead, it aims to take the lower portion of the market with its pricing at $69 USD. Google Pixel details: all about perception (and HTC) This tiny box works with 4K resolution output, HDR features, and all the features that an Android TV device should have. That includes Google voice search, Google cast, and its own physical controller – just in case users want to use a physical controller instead of an app on their smartphone. This device will be available through Mi dot com at first, then at Walmart (both online and in physical stores) in “early October.” So early, it seems, that at least one Walmart already had the device out on shelves, available for purchase. For more information on this device, have a peek at our previous coverage from the past several weeks and months. This device was first shown to the world at Google I/O 2016 earlier this year. Now it’s ready for prime time – just before Google’s event, for whatever odd reason.

português suomeksi svenska Xiaomi brings 4K Mi Box to the United States for $69 Powered by Android TV, Mi Box is available on Mi.com and in Walmart stores News provided by Xiaomi Oct 03, 2016, 11:57 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Oct. 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading consumer technology company Xiaomi announced today that it is bringing Mi Box — its 4K Ultra HD streaming media player powered by Google's Android TV — to the U.S. market for $69. Mi Box will be available on Mi.com starting today at 12 p.m. ET, and in Walmart stores as well as Walmart.com in early October.  With Xiaomi's commitment to bringing innovation to everyone, the $69 price tag of Mi Box is set to disrupt the U.S. market for products that deliver a richer television experience. Mi Box offers 4K support at 60 frames per second, support for the latest HDR10 standard, Google voice search and Google Cast. Thanks to Android TV, Mi Box comes with thousands of movies and shows from popular streaming apps including Netflix, HBO, Showtime and VUDU, as well as games from Google Play. As live streaming TV grows in popularity among U.S. consumers, Mi Box is also offering users easy access to live TV channels including ESPN, CNN and Disney without a cable subscription through Sling TV. Hugo Barra, Vice President, Xiaomi Global said: "We are thrilled to bring Mi Box to our fans in the U.S. in collaboration with Google. This is a significant milestone for Xiaomi, as it is our first opportunity to demonstrate to consumers here in America the power of what makes Xiaomi extraordinary: our promise of innovation for everyone. We believe everyone is entitled to benefit from technological breakthroughs, and Mi Box is a reflection of that belief: an incredible entertainment experience at an unprecedented price of $69, less than the cost of a single night out for two." Sascha Prueter, Google's head of Android TV, said: "The Android TV team is excited to partner with Xiaomi to deliver the Mi Box to the U.S. With features like voice search and HDR support, the Mi Box takes advantage of the latest Android TV platform innovations." Smooth video playback in 4K Ultra HD and HDR Mi Box supports 4K Ultra HD video content playback at 60 frames per second, for the sharpest image quality and smoothest video playback. In addition, Mi Box supports the latest HDR10 standard (to be enabled from Android N onwards), which promises improvements in color and contrast for a significant leap in picture quality when used with compatible TVs. Mi Box supports Microsoft's hardware-based DRM technology PlayReady 3.0, which protects 4K and HDR content and enables a rich viewing experience for 4K Ultra HD video content. Equipped with a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU and Mali 450 GPU, as well as 2GB DDR3 RAM and 8GB eMMC flash, Mi Box provides powerful performance for a smooth streaming and gaming experience. Users can also add additional storage to Mi Box via USB. Mi Box also delivers rich and vibrant audio with Dolby Digital Plus and DTS Surround Sound, creating a cinema-like experience right within the living room. Mi Box offers an exciting range of content from live TV, Netflix, YouTube and more Mi Box arrives in the U.S. on the heels of Xiaomi's success in the TV market in China, where it has already sold over 15 million smart TVs and set-top boxes since 2013. In the U.S., Mi Box is also set to shake up the home entertainment market, as several major content companies have joined Xiaomi to make their content available to a massive new audience. Thanks to Android TV, Mi Box comes with a rich library of content with thousands of movies, shows and games from Google Play, YouTube and other apps. Users have no lack of entertainment options with pre-installed popular streaming apps including Netflix, Pandora, VUDU, Pluto TV and Red Bull TV. Images come to life on TV screens when viewing the wide range of 4K content available from YouTube, Netflix and others. Live streaming TV is poised to explode as a new generation brings its viewing habits into the living room, and Mi Box brings the best available experience for viewing live TV channels including ESPN, CNN and Disney — all without a cable subscription. Special perks (total of $76 value) offered by content partners include: Sling TV: sign up to watch your favorite live channels and get $50 credit towards your subscription Pandora: listen to your favorite music with a 3-month free trial VUDU: rent, buy or watch your favorite movie or TV show on demand with $5 credit Roger Lynch, CEO, Sling TV, said: "Since its founding, Xiaomi has been a disruptor overseas, and we expect the launch of Mi Box in the U.S. to be no different. Our goal has always been to expand Sling TV to the most popular consumer devices, and we believe Mi Box's revolutionary technology and accessible price point paired with the Sling TV experience will be a winning combination among American consumers." Google Cast and Google voice search Mi Box also has built-in Google Cast technology that lets users easily share their small screens, casting TV shows, movies, music and games from their mobile device to the big screen with just a single tap. Mi Box comes with a Bluetooth remote control that supports voice search and commands. Users can simply speak into the remote to search for content by description — try "Leonardo Dicaprio's Oscar movie" to find exactly the right movie, or ask "who played Aragorn in Lord of the Rings" for search results. Users can also change channels, go directly to a TV show or movie, do Web searches, and launch apps by just speaking into the remote. The Bluetooth remote can also be used as a controller for the huge catalog of games available for Android TV. Images of Mi Box can be downloaded here.

She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Sep 29, 2016 2:21 PM EDT ALPHABET INC-CL A +6.18 At Closing, Nov 17th 786.16 USD ALPHABET INC-CL C +6.75 At Closing, Nov 17th 771.23 USD If horror-film villain Freddy Krueger had threatened terror for nine movies but never followed through with evil acts, eventually movie-goers would have stopped being scared of him. Google is at risk of becoming that neutered Freddy Krueger. For years, Google's cloud software for businesses has been seen as a scary, looming threat to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft. It has Google Apps for Work, a competitor to Microsoft Office, and a relatively newer cloud business vying against AWS and Microsoft to take over back-end computing chores. Executives have said they expect Google's cloud software to make more money than its ad products in 2020. To put that ambition in context, Google's ad products generated $67 billion in revenue last year.  Google on Thursday splashily rolled out a revamped lineup of cloud technologies. It seemed to acknowledge it needs to do more to get corporations to try and buy its software. But Google and its respected cloud boss Diane Greene can’t for much longer simply be a theoretical danger to Amazon and Microsoft. They need to show progress by disclosing sizable revenue or other proof they're making headway. So far, the number of press clippings about the cloud operations (including from me) far exceeds actual revenue.  Head in the Cloud Google parent company Alphabet has bought at least five companies since November to help its fledgling cloud business -- about 40% of the company's total acquisitions in that period Source: Bloomberg Note: Dates are when Google announced the purchase. Apigee deal is still pending. It’s now been almost a year since Google hired Greene, a business-software veteran who founded VMware, and consolidated its business software products under her watch. Greene -- who knew the company well as a Google director -- didn’t come cheap. To bring her aboard, Google parent company Alphabet paid $380 million to buy bebop, a mysterious startup Greene had been developing. Including that purchase, five of Alphabet’s 12 announced acquisitions since November have been aimed at helping Google's cloud business, according to an analysis of Bloomberg data. That’s a large share, considering the cloud business is an unknown but likely immaterial chunk of Alphabet's $80 billion in annual revenue. Bebop and a more recent acquisition of cloud-software firm Apigee also were Google's two biggest deals since the 2014 purchase of Dropcam. Those are all signs of commitment. Google also has oodles of money at its disposal, and the best computing network in the world. Those assets should give it a big leg up in business software. But is there progress? It’s hard to know. The company doesn’t disclose finances for Greene’s operation. . It has announced customer wins, although it’s not clear those attention-grabbing customers are paying real money to use Google's software. Apps for Work and the cloud outsourcing products could be quietly huge, but it's not likely. Apps has never made much headway beyond small and medium-sized companies. Google's AWS-like business is growing quickly but commands something like 5 percent market share, with Amazon taking the vast bulk of the rest, according to Synergy Research. At a recent Goldman Sachs event, News Corp’s head of technology predicted AWS "will be incredibly hard to catch." AWS's annual revenue is about $10 billion and shows few signs of slowing down.  Doing Just Peachy Amazon Web Services' revenue continues to climb despite cloud competition from Microsoft and Google Source: Amazon filings There is plenty of room for Google to succeed, even if it doesn't kill Microsoft or Amazon. The three companies aren't so much competing as they are chipping away together at the more than 90 percent of information technology budgets spent on old-fashioned software and hardware. Still, it's no coincidence that very few successful consumer technology companies like Google also do well selling tech to companies. Businesses make for lucrative but demanding customers. They want account reps to yell at when things go wrong. They sometimes ask for technology changes that seem idiotic and self-defeating. They take forever to make decisions and want to cut their bills. Tech companies wouldn't put up with those whiny jerks, except those whiny jerks spend $2 trillion a year on technology. If Google wants to grab a bigger piece of that corporate tech-spending prize, the company needs to show it has more than smarts, ambition and some scary Krueger slasher nails. It needs to show results.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Google on Thursday announced at least the third new name for this collection of Gmail, document and spreadsheet software and more. This product is now called G Suite. Actually, Alphabet doesn't disclose financials for much of anything. We don’t even know business results for most of Alphabet’s large businesses such as YouTube.

Xiaomi’s Mi Box supports 4K video playback as well as HDR. The device ships with a remote control with internal microphone for voice search. Xiaomi first announced the product at Google’s Google I/O developer conference earlier this year. Mi Box is based on Google’s Android TV, which gives it access to apps for most popular streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now and others. In addition, Android TV also supports Google’s Cast technology, adding the ability to launch media playback from thousands of mobile apps. Google hasn’t had much luck with standalone Android TV devices. The company’s Nexus Player was discontinued earlier this year, and Razer’s Android TV device failed to take off as well. Xiaomi’s bargain price could help to change this. Competitors like Apple, Roku and Amazon typically sell their devices with similar features for a lot more. Roku’s new Premiere Plus streamer with 4K and HDR support sells for $100. Consumers who also want a remote control with voice search even need to spend $130 for the new Roku Ultra. Apple TV, which doesn’t support 4K or HDR, starts at $149. Filed Under: Android TV Xiaomi Want to read more articles like this one? SUBSCRIBE TO VARIETY TODAY.

Argos Wolf says: October 3, 2016 at 12:20 pm Does it allow Netflix in TRUE HD? most folks don’t knot that most Android TV boxes don’t stream in true HD, but for some of us with a more critical/trained eye it’s very noticeable. Reply Jared Ba says: October 3, 2016 at 10:45 am This article says the device supports most streaming services, which while true, is slightly misleading. Like most Android platforms, you can’t stream Amazon Prime, which for most of us cuts off half of the non YouTube 4k content available–Netflix being effectively the other half. Additionally the only affordable 4k rental service, UltraFlix also boycotts Android/Googlecast streaming. You might want to amend this article before people spend 70 bucks and find out the hard way.

Related Link: Google's Hardware Announcement: What To Expect According to Recode, the "most strategically important product" that will be shown is Google Home, an Amazon Echo competitor. Google has likely been paying close attention to Amazon's Echo sales and wants to take some of that away. Here is a list of other hardware products and what Recode is expecting. 1. Pixel phones: A phone which is similar to past Nexus devices with the Google brand will likely be detailed. HTC is rumored to be the hardware maker and will feature expected features of a high-end Android phone including fingerprint readers, high-resolution displays and more. 2. Chromecast: The video-streaming stick will likely feature 4K-quality video support and may take on a new name with a higher price tag - Chromecast Ultra. 3. Daydream VR: Google's virtual reality headset is expected to be released for the Halloween season and stems from Google's desire to turn smartphones into VR devices. 4.

One year ago this week, Google officially formed a new holding company called Alphabet to organize its many ambitious projects. Its venture capital arms, life sciences division, moonshot lab and Google itself each became independent entities with their own CEOs, operating under the Alphabet umbrella. For those who work in Google’s core Internet business, not much changed. The word “Alphabet” is rarely brought up in conversation today. The offices remain filled with perks. Sundar Pichai, the well-liked executive who ran much of Google before the restructuring, now serves as Google’s CEO. The biggest difference may be that Google’s leadership can better focus on the future of Google’s consumer products — some of which are expected to be unveiled at a media event on Tuesday — without discussing far flung plans to develop smart contact lenses. But for Alphabet divisions not named Google, the change has been more noticeable, according to interviews with current and former employees who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing relationships with the company. Larry Page, the cofounder and previous CEO of Google, now spends more of his time offering guidance to Alphabet’s experimental groups like self-driving cars, according to former employees. The founder’s involvement shows Alphabet’s commitment to these groups, but there is a downside. Under Alphabet, and CFO Ruth Porat, there is more focus on accountability and managing costs. That has created tensions with some employees who thought Google offered the chance to work on ambitious projects without worrying about the company’s bottom line. At Verily, Alphabet’s health research group, employees are now partly compensated with a new class of Verily stock, according to a former employee. It’s intended as an incentive to grow the division and share in the financial returns just like with a typical startup. Not everyone embraced it. “Some people were like, ‘I didn’t sign up for this risk, because in theory this Verily stock could go to zero and that’s not why I signed up for Google,'” the former employee says. At Nest, the smart home device maker that Google acquired in 2014 for $3.2 billion, executives were initially promised the freedom to innovate without worrying about Google, according to a source familiar with the matter. After the creation of Alphabet, however, Nest employees felt pressure from above to cut costs, the source says. More than that, Nest was forced to begin paying for legal and public relations services previously covered by Google. Andrea Faville, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment for this story. It’s a far cry from the old days at Google. For years, costly new experiments were funded by the company’s incredible success making money from online advertising — and losses from these projects were not broken out for investors to scrutinize. Now Alphabet lists sales and losses from its moonshot projects with a category in its financial statements called “Other Bets.” That segment’s losses rose to $859 million in the quarter ending in June. Wesley Chan, a longtime Google executive who left the company the year before it became Alphabet, remembers Google giving away an estimated $200 million worth of coupons to users to find traction for its commerce efforts, with limited success. Profitability and cost management weren’t top concerns. “When you had Google’s cash cow coming in, you had the liberty of doing things that weren’t quite possible,” Chan says. That may not have been a winning pitch for Wall Street, but it did open the door for more bold experimentation. “There’s still people that feel there’s some boldness there,” Chan says of people working at Google now, “but it’s grown up.” Page hinted at the need for shifting Google’s approach in his original letter announcing the restructuring, saying the goal was to make the company “cleaner and more accountable.” Investors have generally cheered this way of thinking. Alphabet’s stock has soared in the last year. It overtook Apple as the most valuable company in the world on multiple occasions. But there have been growing pains internally. Google has reportedly pushed Fiber, its high-speed Internet division, to cut half its staff. Boston Dynamics, an advanced robotics project that it acquired, is said to be up for sale. Just in the first year, Alphabet has lost top executives from several key projects, including Tony Fadell at Nest, Bill Maris at Google Ventures and Chris Urmson with Google’s self-driving car group. Porat, the Alphabet CFO who was brought in to manage costs and appeal to Wall Street, has stressed on recent investor calls that the company can develop “new sources of revenue growth” from its various projects “in a disciplined way.” “My concern is are they still maintaining the font of creativity and experiments that they want to,” says Frank Gillett, an analyst with Forrester. “I’m not clear that the new model is the right way to do that.” Morgan Stanley sued for using 'sales contests' to churn out loans AI isn't smart enough to keep you on a strict diet -- yet Related Posts Ferrari set to IPO Kuwait is hiking gas prices by up to 83% H&R Block on Donald Trump’s ‘dream’ of putting them out of business Visit Clearfield County Awards Grants Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

According to reports and a series of leaked photos, the technology giant will on Tuesday announce the Pixel and Pixel XL as replacements for its own-brand Nexus smartphones. The most current Google #Pixel and #PixelXL specs. https://t.co/V0LwNLrw6E pic.twitter.com/TUde3CAE94— Droid Life (@droid_life) October 3, 2016 It has been suggested the Pixel will have a 5in display and the Pixel XL a 5.5in screen. The devices will reportedly come with cutting-edge Snapdragon processors, 12-megapixel cameras, fingerprint scanners and larger batteries. Both phones are also expected to arrive with the latest version of Google’s Android software, 7.1 Nougat. The announcement will take place during a live event in San Francisco, where the firm is also expected to give more information on its smart home device, Google Home, which was announced in May. (AP) Google Home enables users to talk to the search engine’s artificial intelligence system to find out news, weather and travel information, as well as use their voice to control smart appliances in their home, including lights and thermostats. The smart speaker is seen as a competitor to Amazon’s Echo system, which has just gone on sale in the UK. An updated version of Google Chromecast, which enables users to stream content from their mobile devices to their TV, is also rumoured to be among the firm’s plans for the event, with the ability to support 4K definition TV expected to be revealed. There have also been suggestions of a new version of Android, designed for laptops and tablets, incorporating aspects of the Chrome OS software Google uses for its desktop computers. Android executive Hiroshi Lockheimer hinted at the change in a tweet last week. We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today.

more_vert androidAndroid App facebookFacebook gplusGoogle + twitterTwitter youtubeYouTube rssRSS Feed search close android facebook gplus twitter youtube rss whatshotNews starsReviews phone_androidPhones tabletTablets appsApps gamesGames network_cellCarriers forumForums attach_moneyDeals Download the App Our Team Tip Us Report: Huawei passed on making Google’s Pixel phones +7,595 Ashley King Oct 3rd, 2016 A new report suggests that Google gave Huawei the option to produce the upcoming Pixel phones that will be revealed tomorrow, but negotiations between the companies broke down when Google demanded no partner logos would appear on this year’s smartphones. The report from Android Police highlights this as just one sticking point that made Huawei back out of the deal it was offered after producing the Nexus 6P last year. The partnership between Huawei and Google for the Nexus 6P extended well beyond what previous manufacturers offered the Nexus program. Both the 5X and the Nexus 6P had extensive warranties that were the first of its kind for Google-backed devices. Google and Huawei both offered financing for the phones, Google through its Project Fi service and Huawei through its own website. However, the report says Huawei didn’t exactly get the rosy deal Google promised when the two companies came together to form the partnership. Apparently one of the big ideas Google had to get Huawei on board was that the Nexus 6P would be sold by all four major national carriers in the US. Huawei would finally have a flagship device on all four carriers, including Verizon, so the company hopped on the deal. Aside from a huge campaign to see the Nexus 6P appear in carrier stores across the country, the two companies were supposed to trade massive advertising budgets for the device in order to promote it. An agreement was struck between Huawei and Google that advertising dollars would be matched between the companies to promote the Nexus 6P, but that massive advertising campaign never happened, either. As we all know, that’s not the way the Nexus 6P was sold in the United States. Talks between Google and the carriers broke down, so Google demanded Google Store exclusivity for the device for a fixed period before it could be offered on third-party retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The only concession here is that Huawei was allowed to sell the phone on their own website, but the limited availability of the phone meant it had very little retail visibility for consumers who didn’t already know about the Nexus line of phones. So what happened this year? Why did Huawei back out? With all of the broken promises between Google and Huawei surrounding the Nexus 6P, it’s really no surprise that the company backed out of this year’s devices. The source cited by Android Police says Huawei and Google were in talks to make up to three phones this year, though it’s not clear if they would have been branded as Nexus, Pixel, or something else. What destroyed the partnership before it took off is one of the ground rules Google laid out for the partnership. Google stated Huawei would serve as the manufacturer only and Google branding would appear on the phone, with no Huawei logo on the exterior of the device or anywhere in official marketing. (You won’t see HTC anywhere on the Pixel phones that are being unveiled tomorrow.) This was the nail in the coffin for Huawei Pixel phones, as the source says Huawei global CEO Richard Yu shut down the negotiations himself. Thus Google had to go with their plan B, which ended up with HTC winning the contract to produce the new phones. local_offer    Google   HTC   Huawei   Nexus 6P   Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (26) stars Further Reading New Google Live Cases available Google accounts suspended for reselling Pixel phones Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design first look First Huawei P10 specs and shots surface OnePlus 3T charging proves solid stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama October 3 Follow @htsuka Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. (AP/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Google is expected to announce two new phones Tuesday, but information seemingly posted early by a British retailer may have given us all a sneak peek. All unofficial leaks, no matter where they come from, should be taken with a grain of salt. With that in mind, however, the leak from retailer Carphone Warehouse does back up a few things already suspected about the phones, according to 9 to 5 Google. (Not only that, the pages that revealed the leaks appear to have been taken down —often a sign that someone jumped the gun.) The Carphone Warehouse leak, for example, supports what we have heard about the new phone's name. For several years, Google has released phones under the "'Nexus" brand name. Rumor has it, however, that Google is ditching the Nexus name in favor of "Pixel" — a name it already uses in its Chromebook lineup for its highest-end device. According to the leak, the phones will come in two sizes. One will have a five-inch screen (larger than the standard iPhone7), while the other will have a 5.5-inch screen (the same same size as the iPhone 7 Plus). Both are supposed to have fast-charging technology, with language on the removed site boasting that they will be able to get seven hours of battery life out of a 15-minute charge. If true, that's certainly not too shabby. They will also reportedly have AMOLED screens, like their predecessors. That promises screens with vibrant colors and deep blacks, which also meet the specifications of Google's virtual reality project, Daydream. Both Pixel models shown on the removed site had a metal body similar to the iPhone, with two speakers that appeared to be rear-facing. Google's options come at a time when the holiday offerings for smartphones aren't looking too exciting. Between the widely criticized headphone-jack-free iPhone and the bad press around the recall of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, consumers may be looking for another option. These Pixel smartphones may not seem like anything much more extraordinary, but they will serve as the first real vessels for Google's fledgling personal assistant. In this space, Google has plenty of competition from Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. But Google's (which is just called Assistant) also has something none of those others do: the extensive suite of services baked into the Android system. [Siri’s creators say they’ve made something better that will take care of everything for you] Getting the assistant to work smoothly with the company's many services — Gmail, Calendar, the newly named G Suite (formerly Apps for Work), Maps, etc. — will be key to the success of Google's efforts in this area overall. And if the Pixel phones can convince the hardcore Google fans that the company's assistant should become a key part of their lives, that paves the way for others to follow in their footsteps — and gives Google a leg up in the battle to design an artificial assistant that will become everyone's constant companion. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing IBM, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon form enormous AI partnership IBM, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon form enormous AI partnership By Graham Templeton on September 29, 2016 at 12:15 pm Comment On Wednesday, the world learned of a new industry association called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, and it includes some of the biggest tech companies in the world. IBM, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon have all signed on as marquis members, though the group hopes to expand even further over time. The goal is to create a body that can provide a platform for discussions among stakeholders and work out best practices for the artificial intelligence industry. Not directly mentioned, but easily seen on the horizon, is its place as the primary force lobbying for smarter legislation on AI and related future-tech issues. Best practices can be boring or important, depending on the context, and in this case they are very, very important. Best practices could provide a framework for accurate safety testing, which will be important as researchers ask people to put more and more of their lives in the hands of AI and AI-driven robots. This sort of effort might also someday work toward a list of inherently dangerous and illegitimate actions or AI “thought” processes. One of its core goals is to produce thought leadership on the ethics of AI development. So, this could end up being the bureaucracy that produces our earliest laws of robotics, if not the one that enforces them. The world “law” is usually used metaphorically in robotics. But with access to the lobbying power of companies like Google and Microsoft, we should expect the Partnership on AI to wade into discussions of real laws soon enough. For instance, the specifics of regulations governing self-driving car technology could still determine which would-be software standard will hit the market first. With the founding of this group, Google has put itself in a position to perhaps direct that regulation for its own benefit. But, boy, is that ever not how they want you to see it. The group is putting in a really ostentatious level of effort to assure the world it’s not just a bunch of technology super-corps determining the future of mankind, like some sort of cyber-Bilderberg Group. The group’s website makes it clear that it will have “equal representation for corporate and non-corporate members on the board,” and that it “will share leadership with independent third-parties, including academics, user group advocates, and industry domain experts.” Well, it’s one thing to say that, and quite another to live it. It remains to be seen if the group will actually comport itself as it will need to if it wants real support from the best minds in open source development. Below, the Elon Musk-associated non-profit research company OpenAI responds to the announcement with a rather passive-aggressive word of encouragement. We're looking forward to non-profits being included as first-class members in the future. — OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 28, 2016 The effort to include non-profits and other non-corporate bodies makes perfect sense. There aren’t many areas in software engineering where you can claim to be the definitive authority if you don’t have the public on-board. Microsoft, in particular, is painfully aware of how hard it is to push a proprietary standard without the support of the open-source community. Not only will its own research be stronger and more diverse for incorporating the “crowd,” any recommendations it makes will carry more weight with government and far more weight with the public. You won’t find Uber in this group right now — but you might soon enough. That’s why it’s so notable that some major players are absent from this early roll coll — most notably Apple and Intel. Apple has long been known to be secretive about its AI research, even to the point of hurting its own competitiveness, while Intel has a history of treating AI as an unwelcome distraction. Neither approach is going to win the day, though there is an argument to be made that by remaining outside the group, Apple can still selfishly consume any insights it releases to the public. Leaving such questions of business ethics aside, robot ethics remains a pressing problem. Self-driving cars illustrate exactly why, and the classic thought experiment involves a crowded freeway tunnel, with no room to swerve or time to brake. Seeing a crash ahead, your car must decide whether to swerve left and crash you into a pillar, or swerve right and save itself while forcing the car beside you right off the road itself. What is moral, in this situation? Would your answer change if the other car was carrying a family of five? Right now these questions are purely academic. The formation of groups like this show they might not remain so for long.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Google may announce ‘Andromeda’ OS at October 4th event Google may announce ‘Andromeda’ OS at October 4th event By Ryan Whitwam on September 26, 2016 at 3:28 pm Comment Google is set to hold an event on October 4th, and it’s a foregone conclusion that the company will unveil the new Pixel flagship phones, Google Home, and a few other hardware goodies. There may also be a surprise software announcement in the cards. There are a number of rumors pointing to an early peek at Andromeda, a version of Android with some Chrome OS bits that make it better for tablet and laptop devices. Rumors of a Chrome OS and Android merger began popping up some months ago, and the arrival of the Play Store on Chromebooks only added fuel to the fire. However, Andromeda is something else. This is Google’s attempt to modify Android using elements from Chrome OS, not a full merging of the projects. Android has long struggled to make a dent in the tablet space, as developers prefer to focus most of their efforts on phone apps. Many consumers are happier to buy a phone with a nearly 6-inch screen rather than have a small phone and a tablet. Android on a tablet isn’t really a different or more useful experience. The few tablets that have keyboard docks (like the Pixel C) don’t really take advantage of them because that’s not the kind of computing Android is designed to do. Google is testing Andromeda with the HTC-built Nexus 9, according to some notes left in the Android Open Source Project. It’s not clear why Google would be using that hardware in particular. The Nexus 9 ran a very unusual dual-core variant of the Nvidia K1 with 64-bit Denver cores. That chip never really lived up to expectations, and indeed, Googlers testing Andromeda on the N9 found it to be at the lower end of acceptable. Perhaps the goal is to see how Andromeda will run on slower devices? At any rate, there probably won’t be a consumer release of Andromeda for the Nexus 9. Google’s head of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer, recently tweeted that the October 4th event will be talked about in eight years time. He said this on the 8th anniversary of Android’s release, implying that what Google announces at the event will continue to have a significant impact in eight years time. Is that Andromeda? It’s certainly possible. As for Andromeda’s actual release, that’s likely still in the future. The rumors point to a Q3 2017 release, possible with new laptop-like Pixel hardware. This device is supposedly already in development and codenamed Bison. It will be an ultra-thin laptop with a 12.3-inch display and stylus functionality. There may also be a smaller 7-inch Huawei-built tablet running Andromeda before that, but the smaller form factor doesn’t make as much sense, given what we know about Andromeda. This might be a developer-oriented device. We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we’ll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) September 24, 2016 Andromeda could finally be Google’s way into the premium laptop and tablet market. Chromebooks have proven extremely popular as low-end devices, but almost no one is going to buy a Chromebook that costs more than $500. With the application base of Android and interface tweaks from Chrome OS, Google might have something worthy of a premium price tag.

Consumer Confidential With David Lazarus BUSINESS Consumer Confidential Newsletter California Inc.: Making the case for 2024 Olympics in L.A. 1984 Olympics Los Angeles Times The opening ceremony of the 1984 Olympics at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Friday is the deadline for organizers of the city's bid for the 2024 Summer Games to submit a second round of material to the International Olympic Committee. The opening ceremony of the 1984 Olympics at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Friday is the deadline for organizers of the city's bid for the 2024 Summer Games to submit a second round of material to the International Olympic Committee. (Los Angeles Times) David Lazarus Welcome to California Inc., the weekly newsletter of the L.A. Times Business Section. I'm Business columnist David Lazarus, and here’s a rundown of upcoming stories this week and the highlights of last week. Because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, prognosticators watch closely to see if we’re keeping the wheels of commerce spinning by hitting the stores. In August, not so much. The Commerce Department said Friday that consumer spending barely grew during the month after a sharp rise in July. The problem: Incomes rose by the smallest amount since winter. LOOKING AHEAD New CEO: American Apparel, the Los Angeles clothier that has been wracked by turmoil in recent years, gets a new leader on Monday. Chelsea Grayson, who has been serving as the company's general counsel and chief administrative officer, moves into the chief executive spot, replacing Paula Schneider, a longtime retail executive who was brought on in January 2015 after American Apparel’s board ousted founder Dov Charney as CEO. Grayson is a lawyer with a background in mergers and acquisitions but little retail experience. Device unveiling: On Tuesday, Google is hosting an event in San Francisco that has the tech world abuzz with speculation. While the Mountain View company hasn’t offered much detail — beyond assigning the event the hashtag #MadeByGoogle — many expect Google to announce new models of its Chromecast streaming media device and its Nexus phone. The tech site Gizmodo further predicts Google will kill the Nexus brand and replace it with phones called Google Pixel. VR conference: Oculus, the Menlo Park-based virtual reality company owned by Facebook, will host its third annual developer conference Wednesday through Friday in San Jose. The company is expected to provide more clarity on the release of its Touch handheld controllers and talk about new features and games for its virtual reality device. Oculus is in a race to reach consumers in the hot VR market. Next week, Sony releases its $399 PlayStation VR headset, a device that sold out in preorders at GameStop in record time. Olympics bid: Friday is the deadline for organizers of Los Angeles’ bid for the 2024 Summer Games to submit a second round of material to the International Olympic Committee. The deadline comes as many L.A. city leaders are asking pointed questions about what financial protections would exist should the city win the Olympics, but then have a funding shortfall or an unforeseen catastrophe. Bid leaders have said the cost of the Games could exceed $6 billion. They expect sponsorships, broadcasting rights and other revenue streams to cover those costs and leave a $161-million surplus. What a trip: Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Paul McCartney, the Who and Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters are coming to Indio this weekend — and so is plenty of cash. The Desert Trip music festival, nicknamed “Oldchella” (almost all of the above are in their 70s), is expected to bring in some $400 million to the Coachella Valley, according to a study contracted by Goldenvoice, promoter of the event. Desert Trip runs Friday through Sunday this week and next, with the classic acts performing both weekends. THE AGENDA Monday’s Business section looks at whether consumers should pay a tax to watch Netflix and other video streaming services. Pasadena and dozens of other California cities are mulling whether to tax subscribers of Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go and other services using existing municipal utility tax codes that initially were designed for taxing cable television subscribers. That follows so-called “Netflix taxes” that already have gone into effect in Pennsylvania and Chicago. Some analysts predict more levies could be coming as state and local agencies try to replace revenue lost from consumers who became cord cutters by dropping cable TV and switching to video streaming. STORY LINES Here are some of the other stories that ran in the Times Business section in recent days that we’re continuing to follow: Wells Fargo: Chief Executive and Chairman John Stumpf suffered a brutal beatdown on Capitol Hill just days after the bank announced he would forfeit compensation worth about $45 million over revelations that employees created millions of accounts without customers’ permission. The San Francisco institution took a more symbolic hit when California state Treasurer John Chiang announced that he has temporarily severed some business relationships with Wells Fargo for the next year. ‘Slumlord’ settlement: The Los Angeles city attorney has reached a $13.5-million settlement with U.S. Bank to resolve allegations that the nation’s fifth-largest bank operated as a slumlord and allowed hundreds of foreclosed properties to deteriorate, fostering crime and blight in L.A. neighborhoods slammed by the housing crisis. The settlement requires the Minneapolis-based firm to maintain its foreclosed properties in “accordance with all applicable laws and standards for two years.” Retirement plan: Nearly 7 million workers for California companies will be automatically enrolled in a new state-run retirement program under a bill signed by Gov. Jerry Brown. The law requires all companies with at least five employees to enroll their workers in the new California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program if they do not offer their own retirement savings plan. State Senate leader Kevin de León called it the “largest expansion of retirement security since the New Deal.” TV troubles: It’s a new TV season, but the first week’s ratings indicate that the networks will be facing what has become the same old problem with younger viewers. During premiere week for the 2016-17 season, overall prime-time TV usage was off around 7% among the 18-to-34 age group compared with a year ago, based on Nielsen data. The number has been on a downward trend over the last few years, reflecting the emergence of online video streaming and video on demand. Off to Mars: SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has finally laid out his plans to eventually transport up to a million people to colonize Mars. But there are more than a few hurdles he’ll have to clear first. In a speech, Musk presented a grand vision — massive rockets launching a fleet of 1,000 spaceships that would each carry about 100 people to Mars. Once on the Red Planet, Musk plans to develop a propellant farm to harvest the methane and liquid oxygen necessary to power the spacecraft for the journey home. WHAT WE’RE READING And some recent stories from other publications that caught our eye: Rough crowd: Don’t mess with Goldman Sachs. That’s the takeaway from a remarkable Bloomberg story about how Libya lost $1.2 billion after investing with the Wall Street bank. The Libyans blame “Goldman’s gifts, slick salesmanship and misleading marketing materials.” Drive my car: Will autonomous vehicles do away with drivers? Probably not, says Fast Company. Just look at airplanes, which can fly in autopilot mode. However, “current cultural norms don’t necessarily accommodate pilot-less flying.” Hired gun: The Atlantic checks out Remedy, a start-up that, for a piece of the action, will help fight your medical bills. It sounds attractive, but as one cybersecurity expert notes, “he personally wouldn’t find the savings worth the risk of a medical data leak.” Lame-stream media: The New Yorker examines Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s adversarial relationship with the press. “He appears to believe in a captive press, of the kind found, for example, in Benito Mussolini’s Italy or Fidel Castro’s Cuba.” Purrrrr: Elon Musk may want to colonize Mars, but how did cats colonize Earth? According to Quartz, cats conquered the planet “by doing odd jobs for farmers and hitching rides on sailing ships.” At least that’s what new research on feline DNA suggests. SPARE CHANGE I think we can all agree that if it wasn’t for cat videos, there’d be no need for the Internet. But here’s the question: What are the best cat videos of all time? Surprised kitty perhaps? Ninja kitty? I’ve always been partial to the existential crises of Henri the French cat. And then there’s this spectacularly awful jump. Got anything better? Share a link.

Well, now it might be Google's turn to reap the mobile tech demand, with its new homebred Pixel smartphones. In collaboration with HTC, which is developing the hardware, Google has been dropping hints about Pixel, its replacement for the outgrown Nexus series. On Tuesday, it is expected to finally unveil its latest Android 7.1 Nougat OS as well as the smartphone. This was confirmed by the photos and information leaked by UK-based smartphone retailer Carphone Warehouse on Monday. So much for Tuesday...#GooglePixel https://t.co/8vk9RtnryD— Brian Tong (@briantong) October 3, 2016 Competing with the iPhone means your product had better be cutting-edge. And Google Pixel, a mobile offshoot of the Chromebook Pixel and the Pixel C Android Tablet, boasts of all the necessary specs. Equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB RAM, amoled screens, fingerprint scanners, 12MP-8MP camera with optical image stablisation, 1080P and quad-HD displays, Pixel — along with its larger sibling, Pixel XL — will come with a 5-inch- and 5.5-inch-screen versions.

With the Nexus, Google had a bit of an aggressive pricing policy. But since Pixel is state-of-the-art, the devices will reportedly be priced starting at $649.

So much has been leaked now that we know pretty much everything there is to know about these Pixel phones. With every Android manufacturer except Samsung in a death spiral, while Samsung's phones are having 'issues', it makes sense for Google to try and assert more control over what used to be the Nexus line. The result will be devices carrying Google's own Pixel brand. One aspect of the rumours and leaks that caught my attention was this bit: Making two high-end phones with all the bells and whistles, just as ready for the future as they are today is a step in the right direction. Buying billboards and commercial space during sports events so people know you're doing it is another step. Speculation about having a well-trained support staff that you can reach anytime from anywhere through the phone's settings points to yet another. If Google builds a better mousetrap and makes sure everyone knows they built a better mousetrap, the world may beat a path to their door. If Google is really going to pursue a serious effort to expand the Nexus (okay, Pixel) appeal beyond us nerds, it's going to need more than billboards in New York. It's going to need these phones to be front and centre with carriers, smartphone stores, and online stores. It's going to need an aggressive marketing campaign to capture the attention of people who would otherwise just opt for an iPhone or Galaxy, and explain to them why they should abandon the two major brands they know. Most of all, though, Google is going to need a support structure for these phones. For reasons that are still unclear to me, my Nexus 6P is not receiving its monthly security patches anymore, and I have no idea why. Sure, I can figure it out by browsing or posting on XDA or diving deep into my phone's software (and I will), but I'm a nerd, so set those options aside for a moment - where would I go with an issue like this? Who would I contact for help? Can I walk into a Google Store or whatever and get some sanctioned support for this issue? The answer is - as with anything related to Google and support - a firm and resounding 'no'. If Google really wants to take its Pixel phones to the masses, it's going to need a sales and support structure that goes well beyond store.google.com and XDA.

Search result 'snippet' claims 'reverse racism does not exist' Asking Google 'can you be racist towards white people?' was found to bring up an extract from Huffington Post in a 'snippet box' as an answer The text in the featured snippet claimed that reverse racism does not exist Google has said the extract was pulled out by an automatic algorithm By Shivali Best For Mailonline Published: 12:16 EST, 3 October 2016 | Updated: 16:00 EST, 3 October 2016 e-mail 105 shares 78 View comments While Google is usually helpful at answering weird and wonderful questions, it may have got itself into deep water with a question about racism. When asked 'can you be racist towards white people?' the search engine is claimed to have highlighted an answer claiming that ethnic minorities can't be racist to white people. Google, however, has insisted the answer is not a conscious promotion and is instead the result of an algorithm linking another site. When a user asks a question in Google Search, it often shows a summary of the answer in a special featured snippet block at the top of the search results page GOOGLE SNIPPETS When a user asks a question in Google Search, it often shows a summary of the answer in a special featured snippet block at the top of the search results page.  This featured snippet block includes a summary of the answer, extracted from a webpage, plus a link to the page, the page title and URL. When a user asks a question in Google Search, it often shows an extract from a webpage that its algorithms believes provides the answer in a special featured snippet block at the top of the search results page. This featured snippet block includes a summary of the answer, extracted from a webpage, plus a link to the page, the page title and URL. A writer for The Sun asked the search engine: 'Is it possible to be racist to a white person?', and claims the featured snippet given was a one-sided controversial answer. The snippet that apparently appeared comes from a Huffington Post article, and says: 'While reverse racism does NOT EXIST, racism does.

'White people have power to oppress black people because they control the system and economic structure in society.' The article this is taken from is called '4 "Reverse Racism" Myths That Need To Stop'. Google's search results regularly feature 'snippets' at the top of the page that extract text from a webpage. Although the snippet now features a different extract when searching for 'Can you be racist to white people', the offending Huffington Post article is still the top result (pictured) A spokesperson for Google told MailOnline: 'Google does not endorse or select responses manually.  'This content comes from the third-party sites that we do not control.  'The [snippet] feature is an automatic and algorithmic match to the search query.  'We welcome feedback, as we’re always working to improve our algorithms.  'Users and content owners can give feedback on incorrect information through the "Feedback" button at the bottom right of the WebAnswer.' Since the Sun's article appeared, conducting the same search now brings up a different result in the snippet box from a blogger called SlapDashMom. The extracted text on this occasion is from a comment at the top of the page that claims 'prejudice against white people is not racism'.  The Huffington Post article, however, still appears as the top result in the search results.  But the discovery raises important questions about the purpose of the snippet box in search results. Google claims the snippets are supposed to be selected because they answer a specific question, but it seems the snippet box also includes opinion rather than facts.   Common Google searches about the UK from various other European countries are in some cases anything but flattering Read more: Featured snippets in search - Search Console Help Google promotes claim it's NOT possible for ethnic minorities to be racist against white people www.google.co.uk...

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Huawei reportedly shunned Google over Pixel phones - here's why Huawei reportedly shunned Google over Pixel phones - here's why by Chris Smith 03 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Chinese manufacturer Huawei passed on the chance to build the Google Pixel phones scheduled to be announced tomorrow, according to a report. AndroidPolice sources say the Nexus 6P maker pulled out of talks with Google after the US giant insisted there’d be no room for a manufacturer name or logo on either handset. There would also have been no scope for Huawei’s name to be mentioned in the marketing, effectively reducing the firm to a silent manufacturing partner. Related: Google Pixel vs Pixel XL: What to expect? As a result, Huawei pulled out, according to the report, allowing HTC to step into the void. However, the logo row may have been a straw that broke the camel’s back in the relationship between Huawei and Google. The report says, Google made promises to Huawei over widespread network support for the 6P in the United States, as the firm attempted to gain a foothold in the American market. None of that materialised with Google keeping the Nexus 6P as a virtual Google Store exclusive for long periods of time, with none of the major networks on board. AndroidPolice also says promises were made over huge marketing budgets, which were not fulfilled. As such Huawei remains without much of a presence in the United States, despite building one of the all-time, best reviewed Android devices in the Nexus 6P. Ironically, as the report points out, a deal with Google to build the Pixel, would have netted Huawei the major network support it is seeking, as the new handsets will apparently be available through Verizon. However, without its name and logo on the phone, would it have been any use to Huawei anyway? Share your thoughts below.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Google expected to unveil new Pixel smartphones By Press Association Published: 15:11 EST, 3 October 2016 | Updated: 15:11 EST, 3 October 2016 e-mail Google is set to unveil two new smartphones as the technology giant aims to challenge Samsung and Apple in the premium phone market. According to reports and a series of leaked photos, the company will on Tuesday announce the Pixel and Pixel XL as replacements for Google's own-brand Nexus smartphones. It has been suggested the Pixel will have a 5in display and the Pixel XL a 5.5in screen. The new devices are expected to be replacements for Google's Nexus line of phones The devices will reportedly come with cutting-edge Snapdragon processors, 12-megapixel cameras, fingerprint scanners and larger batteries. Both phones are also expected to arrive with the latest version of Google's Android software, 7.1 Nougat. The announcement will take place during a live event in San Francisco, where the firm is also expected to give more information on its smart home device, Google Home, which was announced in May. It enables users to talk to Google's artificial intelligence system to find out news, weather and travel information, as well as control smart appliances in their home, including lights and thermostats, using their voice. The smart speaker is seen as a competitor to Amazon's Echo system which has just gone on sale in the UK. An updated version of the Google Chromecast, which enables users to stream content from their mobile devices to their TV, is also rumoured to be among Google's plans for the event, with the ability to support 4K definition TV expected to be revealed. There have also been suggestions of a new version of Android, designed for laptops and tablets, incorporating aspects of the Chrome OS software Google uses for its desktop computers. Android executive Hiroshi Lockheimer hinted at the change in a tweet last week: "We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016." Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

MacMcCannTX.com. Oct 03, 2016 Share Tweet 0 When it comes to the latest technology, leaks seem to be unavoidable, as Google discovered recently when their Pixel phones were leaked just days before their official unveiling Tuesday, Oct. 4. Carphone Warehouse, an electronics retailer in the U.K., posted the product pages for the new Pixel and Pixel XL phones on its website before quickly taking them down—but not before the internet was all over it. ​ Related Need Sperm? There's an App For That Forget Self-Driving Cars: Uber Wants to Fly You Around in a Self-Driving Drone Taxi Leaked: Is This The Body For The New iPhone? Google, who develops the Android operating system, is going in a new direction with the Pixel phones. First and foremost, Google's logo is now front and center, as the company will develop both the hardware and the software, according to The Guardian. The change comes as Google is rumored to be dropping the name brand Nexus from their phones. The generically designed Pixel has a 5-inch screen, and the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch screen, according to Wired.  According to Android Police, who snagged the leaked pictures, both of the two new phones will have "free unlimited photo backups, at maximum resolution, through Google Photos." They'll also have a new interface, 1080p display, an 8-megapixel front camera and a 12MP back camera with optical image stabilization, fingerprint scanners on the back, USB-C fast charging, 4GB of RAM, video calling, and Google Assistant. You can get 32GB or 128GB of storage, according to multiple reports. The starting price is expected to be around $649. Perhaps most important, Google's two new phones—unlike the new iPhone 7—will still have a headphone jack, so you can still pass the aux without having to spend extra money.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Huawei may have passed on a chance to manufacture the Pixel and Pixel XL for Google. A new report from Android Police claims the Chinese company cut off negotiations after the search giant made it clear that it wouldn’t allow any manufacturer branding on the upcoming devices. Google was initially interested in producing up to three smartphones but didn’t want Huawei’s logo on the devices or in any marketing materials. In response, Huawei CEO Richard Yu reportedly walked away from the negotiating table. Google subsequently decided to go with HTC, its “plan B,” as a manufacturing partner. Huawei’s troubles with Google may go back even further. Android Police said that, when the two companies originally partnered to make the Nexus 6P, the phone was supposed to launch on all four major U.S. carriers, giving the Chinese company a strong presence in retail stores across the country. That plan failed to materialize after Google’s carrier negotiations fell through. Huawei is still struggling to break into the U.S. market. Despite these issues, Huawei and Google may still be working together on a number of projects. Rumor has it the Chinese company was tapped to produce a new 7-inch tablet for developers to test out Google’s Andromeda software. The two companies are also allegedly in talks for a new phone launching in late 2017, which may also run Andromeda.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel details : release all about perception (and HTC) Chris Burns - Oct 3, 2016 5 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Google Pixel phone has arrived, in two sizes, complete with the company’s new public image for their brand. The letter G, simplicity in all things, the absence of over-thinking names for apps and connecting devices to other smart devices and those devices to the web. If we’re to believe Google will do what we’re fairly sure they will do, this isn’t going to be about a spec war. Google has long since discovered that their biggest competitor(s) don’t play on that basketball court, anyway. The game Apple plays is in design and advertising. Apple has created in the public the perception that their smartphone is the most desirable. They might suggest that the iPhone is the best, and that the iPad is the best – and that’s arguable. But what they’re doing is harnessing the power of perception to such a degree that iOS device users don’t feel the need to switch to a different brand, just so long as Apple still exists and still continues to make new devices. Google, on the other hand, has been cultivating an ecosystem of software that works on all manner of devices. They’ve been creating an operating system that supports many different brands, each making their own iteration of what Google’s baseline Nexus smartphone line presents. They’ve been doing everything right for people that love an open environment with freedom of implementation on a wide variety of different sorts of hardware. If Android is a public drinking fountain Google’s been running for the past 8 years, Pixel is Google’s first set of self-branded bottled water. Those looking for a whole new era of devices with specifications that put past generations to shame will be disappointed, at least mildly. Google’s next wave, with Pixel, is not about competing on benchmarks, or taking the best photos, or having the longest battery life (though they’ll probably speak about these things here and there). Google’s next wave is about perception. Google will aim to make the world perceive that they’re ready to usher in a new age of quality control over their devices. They’ll be responsible for how each device looks, feels, and functions. Updates won’t just be made to make Android look good. Updates will be made to make Pixel devices function better. Updates will be made to make Pixel gain new features. The first couple of Pixel phones will be manufactured by HTC. Not entirely unlike how HTC makes the Vive VR headset and Valve sells it – and HTC sells it too – HTC will make the first couple of Pixel phones. Google wont likely be as up front about who’s behind the wheel with Pixel’s hardware bits as Valve is with the Vive, but it won’t be that different a story. The most important part of this Pixel brand, for Google, is that the public perceives that they’re finally selling the Google Phone, with a big fat “G” on the back so we know who guarantees it.

Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's competition commissioner, speaks at a news conference in Brussels on April 20, 2016. Credit: Georges Boulougouris/EU More like this EU levels more charges against Google Russia slaps Google with a $6.8M Android antitrust fine EU charges Google with foisting its search and browser on smartphone makers Video Add-ons elevate new Moto Z phones The European Commission is preparing to fine Google for paying smartphone makers to exclusively use its search engine on their mobile devices, according to Reuters. The European Union's antitrust authority filed a so-called statement of objections against Google in April, accusing it of forcing smartphone makers to exclusively use its search engine if they want access to the Play Store, through which phone users can download and purchase other apps. Now the Commission has sent a redacted copy of that statement of objections to complainants, Reuters reported after seeing the document. The Commission plans to order Google to stop offering payments or discounted license fees to smartphone makers for putting its search engine and app store on their phones systems based on Android. If Google does not stop, the company faces a fine "at a level which will be sufficient to ensure deterrence," Reuters quoted the document as saying. The fine will be calculated based on the duration of the anticompetitive practices -- from January 2011 to the present -- and the revenue they generate, including that from AdWords clicks by European users, Google Search product queries, Play Store apps purchase and AdMob in-app advertisements, said the document sent to complainants last week. A spokesman for Fairsearch, a group lobbying for competition in online and mobile search, said the organization had no immediate comment on the report. Google and the European Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in April that she is concerned that Google, by forcing phone makers to exclusively use certain of its own apps, is excluding rival app developers from a key way to reach new customers: pre-loading them on new smartphones.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Huawei Reportedly Passed On Google’s Pixel Smartphones By Adnan Farooqui on 10/03/2016 08:14 PST Huawei has worked with Google on Nexus devices in the past but a new report suggests that the company passed on the opportunity to work with Google on its new Pixel smartphones. This is the first time that Google will be launching smartphones under the Pixel brand and it’s meant to send out a message that Google is serious about its hardware ambitions. Huawei was reportedly offered the chance to work with Google on Pixel smartphones but negotiations between the two companies fell through. It was rumored at one point that Huawei might be the manufacturer of the 2016 Nexus smartphones. AndroidPolice hears from a source that talks between the companies fell through when Google demanded that partners logos will not be placed on the new phones. The report also mentions that the partnership between Huawei and Google for the Nexus 6P never fully materialized. Google reportedly told the Chinese company that it would get the flagship Nexus smartphone on all four major carriers in the country and Huawei saw it as a way to break into the lucrative U.S. market. Talks between Google and the carriers are said to have broken down which is why the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X were never sold through major carriers. They put the entire episode behind them and started talking about a partnership for the 2016 lineup. Google wouldn’t budge on one rule: It wouldn’t allow Huawei’s logo or name on the device or even on the marketing materials. This didn’t sit well with Huawei and the report claims that CEO Richard Yu himself ended negotiations with Google after it wouldn’t budge on this rule. Neither Huawei nor Google have officially commented on this report yet. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Google, Huawei and nexus 6p.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey Automation California DMV Embraces Fully Driverless Cars in Proposed Rules The state is moving toward a future where cars can operate without humans. by News Staff / October 3, 2016 0 A blind man sits in a Google prototype autonomous vehicle that lacks a steering wheel and other human controls. Screenshot/Google Self-Driving Car Project The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has opened the door to fully driverless, steering wheel-less cars. On Sept. 30 the department released a revised draft of proposed regulations that would, unlike the original version, create a path for cars that humans can’t manually operate. The rules, which came 10 days after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) laid out large pieces of a plan to regulate the vehicles, would require manufacturers to report testing data to the state prior to deployment. The previous version of the rules required a human driver to be present in the vehicle and capable of taking over at any time. That requirement is still in place, but only if the manufacturer doesn’t hold a permit to test or deploy a vehicle without a driver. RELATEDUse of Backup Cameras Allowed in Pennsylvania Driver's TestsCalifornia’s Regulation of Driverless Cars May Be Influenced by Public Forum California Bill Will Allow for More Testing of Autonomous Vehicles For those that do hold the new permits, the rules would mean opening up a wide new world of possibilities in transportation. By their nature, driverless cars could bring more mobility to people who are sorely lacking it at present — people with disabilities, the elderly, the young and those who simply can’t afford it. The vehicles might also help cut down congestion, use existing infrastructure more efficiently, reduce transportation costs and curb pollution. Many have speculated that, once vehicles gain the ability to drive themselves, cities could be redesigned to give more space to people and less to vehicles. One big caveat in the California DMV proposal: As with all cars, driverless vehicles would still need to comply with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which include language requiring, among other things, a steering wheel and human-operated brakes. U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx has repeatedly said that NHTSA has authority to exempt certain vehicles from those rules, but there’s a limit on the number of exemptions the agency can hand out — far fewer than the number of sales a major auto manufacturer would expect in any given year. “It is becoming clear that existing NHTSA authority is likely insufficient to meet the needs of the time and reap the full safety benefits of automation technology,” reads a document NHTSA released earlier this year. The California DMV proposal would require manufacturers to first obtain a permit to test driverless cars and then complete at least one year’s worth of testing before they would be eligible for a permit to deploy the vehicles en masse. The year of testing would include a report to the DMV about instances in which the vehicles “disengaged” from autonomous driving mode, meaning there was some failure of the equipment or technology, or otherwise that the manufacturer saw a need to intervene while the car was driving itself and override the self-driving software. Vehicles would also need to have data-recording devices to keep information about conditions before and after a crash. Manufacturers would need to provide that data to law enforcement after an accident. The new rule draft also narrows the kinds of vehicles the state would allow manufacturers to make autonomous. The draft would prohibit testing and deployment of autonomous: motorcycles; buses; general public paratransit vehicles; and most semitrucks, based on weight and length restrictions. The DMV will hold a public hearing on the revised rules on Oct. 19 in Sacramento.

SUBSCRIBE Google opens the AMP fire hose Columnist Barb Palser believes that the broad surfacing of AMP content in mobile search will expose a universe of AMP content that’s been hidden from view. Barb Palser on October 3, 2016 at 9:24 am More Google’s expansion of Accelerated Mobile Pages across mobile search results is underway, gradually turning the trickle of AMP traffic to a steady flow. The September start of the “blue links” rollout, along with announcements from some high-profile participants in the AMP Project, are advancing the open-source initiative on multiple fronts. Google’s AMP expansion Since Accelerated Mobile Pages first appeared in Google search results in February 2016, AMPs have been mostly concentrated in the Top Stories area of mobile search results: AMP Top Stories carousel in Google mobile search results The current expansion, which was announced in August and started in mid-September, will surface AMPs throughout standard mobile search results, aka “blue links.” When the phased blue links rollout is complete, Google will always present the validated AMP version of a page to mobile users instead of the standard web link. At this stage, Google is only surfacing a portion of available AMPs; a September 25 query returned a mixture of AMP and non-AMP results in the blue links area. When the expansion is complete, all available AMPs will be displayed. AMP blue links Along with the blue links rollout, Google made slight modifications to its AMP viewer. The user interface is now grey instead of blue and employs an “X” button instead of a back arrow to close the viewer and return to search results. Redesigned AMP viewer Broader, deeper AMP exposure For news publishers, the blue links expansion will surface evergreen and long-tail content that wouldn’t have been eligible for the Top Stories area but accounts for a large portion of search traffic. It also opens AMP exposure to commercial, vertical and non-news publishers. Essentially, any AMP-enabled content that would normally surface in search will be presented to users. A diverse group of non-news publishers timed their own announcements to Google’s blue links rollout. On September 20, eBay announced that its AMP-enabled product pages were live after a few months of development work to resolve some feature gaps. On the same day, Shopify announced plans to AMP-enable its merchants and Reddit announced the launch of tens of millions of AMP pages on its platform. These companies join Fandango, Food Network and other non-news publishers on AMP.  There’s plenty of content to fill the fire hose. Non-news AMPs: eBay product page and Food Network recipe. AMP benefits in Google search Google has stated repeatedly that AMP is not a ranking factor (at least not yet), but that doesn’t mean AMP content won’t get special treatment. Most noticeably, Google has been building user experiences to showcase AMPs above standard search results. The “Top Stories” carousel was the first example — and now Google is working on a “Live Coverage” AMP carousel for breaking news, elections, sports and other real-time events. These modules dominate the top of the mobile viewport, above standard results where non-AMP links appear. It’s easy to imagine a variety of special AMP-based user experiences for all types of informational and commercial content. In addition, Google has signaled that load time in general will matter in its ranking algorithm going forward — and has contributed to the growing mountain of research establishing load time as a predictor of user satisfaction and engagement. With Google’s data showing an average mobile page load time of 19 seconds and a 53-percent abandonment rate after three seconds of waiting, lightning-fast AMPs should ace any speed-related SEO tests. Finally, users could begin to reward AMP publishers by favoring AMPs in search results. If users begin to recognize the AMP icon and associate it with a fast page, they may start choosing AMP links (or avoiding non-AMP links) in search results for certain types of content and queries. Over time, such preferences could manifest in changes to search performance. (In early September, Google was observed testing a darker, more noticeable AMP icon.) Combined, all of these factors could provide advantages to AMP-enabled publishers over non-AMPed publishers, even if the ranking algorithm for general Google search results doesn’t explicitly favor AMP. AMP beyond Google Apart from Google’s use of AMP, new participants are bringing the broader potential of the open-source AMP Project into view. The eBay and Reddit announcements cited speed and performance as primary reasons for adopting AMP — and opened the door to future AMP-only strategies. Excerpt from Reddit’s blog post (emphasis added): AMP pages look great and load fast on desktop just like they do on mobile. Maintaining good performance to pages as they change often amounts to a time consuming game of Whac[k]-A-Mole but we can be confident our AMP pages will always be fast. So, for many kinds of pages, we think the AMP version is the only version we’ll ever need. Excerpt from eBay’s blog post (emphasis added): Although both of them [AMP and non-AMP browse pages] are highly optimized, look the same, and share most of the code, updating both versions is still a maintenance overhead. In addition, we always need to watch out for feature parity. In the future, based on how AMP pages are performing, we may choose to have one mobile version (AMP) and serve it to all platforms. The expansion of AMP to desktop experiences and the potential for AMP to replace standard web pages have been anticipated by the AMP Project from the start — but these are among the first large publishers to talk publicly about it. A few days later, Bing announced AMP support in its search app for iOS and Android in order to provide a better, more consistent user experience. Like Google, Bing will link to the AMP version of a page when available. AMP results in Bing Search app This is something any search engine, social platform or other referrer could do — every standard web page with an AMP counterpart has a header tag pointing to the AMP version. Social news aggregator Nuzzel has been linking to AMPs for some time, and Twitter has taken initial steps to link to AMP in certain contexts. Google’s promotion of AMP across its products is generating awareness, providing incentives for publisher adoption and driving feature development and innovation. At the same time, the involvement of diverse participants and non-Google-dependent use cases will be critical to AMP’s long-term success and its mission to improve performance across the mobile web — not just a corner of it. The AMP format was seeded in Google’s environment but was never meant to stay there. Some opinions expressed in this article may be those of a guest author and not necessarily Search Engine Land.

SUBSCRIBE How mobile has changed the way we search, based on 10+ years of eye-tracking studies How has the rise of mobile changed the way people view Google SERPs? Contributor Kristi Kellogg summarizes a session from SMX East in which Mediative's Chris Pinkerton discusses the results of eye-tracking studies. Kristi Kellogg on October 3, 2016 at 10:22 am More Chris Pinkerton, the vice president of business development at Mediative, has been tracking the ways viewers look at the Google search engine results page (SERP) since 2003. In that time, Mediative’s eye-tracking studies have revealed major shifts in the way users consume the SERP. At SMX East 2016, he explored the ways the proliferation of mobile devices have deeply impacted user search behavior on both mobile and desktop searches. Pinkerton asserts that search activity, psychologically speaking, is mindless activity. It’s mindless because of the habits that form with the devices we use. Chris Pinkerton Habits are a very powerful thing to start to understand. Developing a habit of consuming information on a desktop in a certain way changes the way you consume content. Looking back at 2003, Google became the dominant search engine because it drove people to find information faster than its competitors. That created habitual behavior — people found content the fastest on Google and kept coming back. (As an aside, Bing has implemented programs to pay people for their search behavior in an attempt to break these deeply ingrained habits and introduce a new behavior.) In 2005, there was a Golden Triangle pattern when it came to eyeballs on the Google SERP. But in 2016, this pattern is vastly different (see below), due in large part to mobile. It’s changed the way people consume the SERP and the speed at which they consume it. Users spot-scan and find what is contextually relevant for them. Mobile devices have habitually conditioned searchers to scan vertically more than horizontally. This has translated to desktop search as well. People are viewing more search listings during a single session but are spending less time viewing each one. Users are looking the front end of search listings, so make sure your main message comes first. While it used to take a user 2.6 seconds to consume a SERP, that time has been cut in half, to 1.3 seconds, Pinkerton said. Regardless of mobile’s impact, the No. 1 organic listing captures the most click activity, regardless of what new elements are presented. However, it takes 87 percent longer for the No. 1 organic listing to be first seen on a mobile device vs. desktop, he said. Statistics that will impact your digital marketing strategy Knowledge Graph With a Knowledge Graph panel on the SERP, almost 22 percent fewer clicks went to the top No. 1 organic listing. 93% of searchers look at the Knowledge Graph panel. 49% of searchers click on the Knowledge Graph panel. Nineteen percent of mobile SERP clicks on average went to the top two sponsored ads, compared to fifteen percent on desktop. #smx #sem @Mediative pic.twitter.com/oqzmKzgzz7 — MKTg Robot (@themktgrobot) September 28, 2016 Local listings and map 47% more clicks on the map and local listing occur when positioned above the organic listings. 10% of clicks on local listing on average. 51% more searchers view the local listings and map when positioned above the organic listings. Star ratings Listings with star ratings capture 24% of page clicks on average. Sponsored listings Top sponsored listings are viewed after 0.36 seconds on average. 2% of clicks on the top two sponsored listings on mobile vs. 14.5% on desktop. The top organic listing gets 10% fewer clicks when three sponsored listings are present vs. one sponsored listing. Organic listings Top organic listings capture the most search activity (33.2%). 5% of searchers on average look at the top organic listing. 57% of clicks go to the top four organic listings on average. Only 7.4% of the clicks that occur are below the fourth organic listing on mobile vs. 16% on desktop. Read Mediative’s full eye-tracking report (registration required).

Canadian artist and filmmaker Jon Rafman spends many hours culling through these images. He displays the best ones (though never gives their location) on his blog.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. A UK retailer appears to have leaked everything about Google's new Pixel phones Jeff Dunn Oct. 3, 2016, 10:43 AM 165,402 facebook linkedin twitter email print An apparent leak of the Google Pixel.Carphone Warehouse/Google/Android Police Google's big hardware showcase on October 4 is nearly here, but the company might not have much left to say about the two Pixel smartphones it's expected to reveal by the time the event starts. Those phones have been extensively leaked as it is, but a since removed listing from UK retailer Carphone Warehouse (spotted by 9to5Google) appears to have provided the most complete look yet.  According to the page, Google will indeed launch two phones at two sizes: the 5-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. (A smaller leak from Canadian carrier Bell corroborated the former earlier yesterday.) This further suggests that Google will drop the Nexus branding it has typically used in favor of its own Pixel name, and will market the phones as being "made by Google." That said, the devices are widely said to have been manufactured by HTC, and a series of slides within the listings suggest that both phones look largely similar to this year's all-metal HTC 10. That means they'll resemble iPhones — though the glass panels, fingerprint scanners, and "G" logos on each handset's back should provide some separation. The listing also pegs both phones as having similarly high-end specs: a new Snapdragon 821 processor, 4 GB of RAM, a USB-C port, and either 32 GB or 128 GB of internal storage. The smaller Pixel is said to have a 1080p OLED display and a 2,770 milliampere-hour battery, while the Pixel XL is said to have a 1440 x 2560 OLED display and a bigger 3,450 milliampere-hour battery. Both phones reportedly come with a 8-megapixel camera on the front and a 12-megapixel camera on the back. Carphone Warehouse/9to5Google Beyond that, the slides suggest support for the new Google digital assistant, unlimited photo storage with Google Photos, and the already unveiled Allo and Duo chat apps. The devices are also said to support a quick charging feature that reportedly provides up to seven hours of battery life within 15 minutes. It's important to remember that Google has only teased the new phones thus far, so all of the above needs to be taken with a grain of salt. For instance, the listing says both phones will include a microSD slot for expandable storage, something Google has traditionally veered away from. There's also no word on pricing, though previous rumors suggest they'll start around $650. Nevertheless, any lingering questions about Google's new phones should be answered by tomorrow afternoon.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Here’s What to Expect at Google’s Big Product Event Tomorrow October 3, 2016 10:51am Nasdaq:GOOG ShareTweet Google parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is gearing up for its biggest product launch event in history. Here’s what investors can expect to see tomorrow. The event’s biggest attraction will almost certainly be Google Home, which is Google’s new connected speaker device. Set to compete directly against Amazon’s Echo speakers and Alexa voice command service, very few details about Home are available at this time. That will all change tomorrow as the company unveils the device, which is expected to feature its new Assistant service that will help users with search queries, home appliances, music, and much more. Google Home speaker, image courtesy of Google/YouTube Another big product Google is slated to announce tomorrow is its new mobile phone, dubbed Pixel. The company is moving away from the “Nexus” branding of previous generations, and will reportedly offer its first two new phones, Pixel and Pixel XL, very soon. The XL version predictably has a larger screen, and both options will include the latest version of the Android mobile operating system called Nougat. Leaked photo of Pixel phone, courtesy of OnLeaks/Android Authority These new phones could very well mark Google’s plans to begin producing its own hardware. While Pixel will be made by HTC, the company is reportedly looking into manufacturing its own phones in the near future. Google will likely also unveil a new version of Chromecast, its streaming media device. The new version will likely support 4K resolution. Additionally, the company will reportedly present a virtual reality headset designed for use with Android phones. Earlier this year, Google announced a VR platform called Daydream, and the new headset will be the first Daydream-focused peripheral. It also will probably include a wireless remote for interacting with VR apps. Other potential product announcements include a mash-up of the Chrome and Android operating systems, a Google-branded router, and a new 7-inch Android-powered tablet. We’ll be sure to follow up on the event after it happens, and clue investors in on the most important highlights. Alphabet shares fell $6.35 (-0.79%) to $797.71 in Monday morning trading. Year-to-date, GOOG has gained 2.35%, versus a 6% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 during the same period.

I saw all of the talk proposals and it was really hard to pick who would be invited to present. Thank you to everyone who submitted a proposal — sorry we couldn’t include everyone. On the other hand, with more and more of our live events we’ve been able to include a small number of speakers because we meet so many people through these proposals. I see that trend continuing!

From updated smartphones to a new VR headset, we're expecting big things to come out of Google's Oct. 4 press event in San Francisco. Our coverage begins Tuesday at noon ET/9 a.m. PT. Until then, here's a roundup of rumored product announcements, and whether we think they'll see the light of day on Tuesday. New Phones What We Know: Google's Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X were released about a year ago — a lifetime in the world of smartphones — and are due for a refresh. Google has already released a new version of its Android operating system and, while devices like the LG V20 feature the updated OS, Google would surely likely a flagship phone of its own to showcase Android Nougat. What We Think We Know: Google's new phones reportedly won't be named Nexus at all. According to Android Police, the phones will now be known as Pixel phones, led by the 5-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. MORE: Pixel Phone Rumors: What to Expect from Google's Devices HTC is reportedly building the phones on behalf of Google, and both the Pixel and Pixel XL are expected to feature the latest hardware -- specifically Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 processor. Qualcomm says the 821 is 10 percent faster than its predecessor and that the Adreno GPU is getting a 5 percent boost as well. It will be interesting to see how the Snapdragon 821-powered Pixel phones measure up to Apple's latest iPhones, which pack a processing punch of their own thanks to Apple's A10 Fusion chip. Credit: VentureBeatAs for specs, the 5-inch Pixel phone is expected to offer a 1080p display, while the Pixel XL will feature 2560 x 1440. Both phones should have 4GB of RAM, 12-megapixel cameras on the back, 8-MP cameras up front and larger batteries than their Nexus predecessors. UK retailer Carphone Warehouse confirmed these rumored specs when it posted information about the Pixel phones prematurely. That Carphone Warehouse post also revealed that the rear camera on both phones will an f/2.0 aperture and 1.55-micron pixels, which could mean for better photos in low light. Credit: VentureBeatMore Venture Beat published a leaked image of the rumored phone last week, with the most noticeable feature being the circular launcher icons on the phone's interface. Read More Reports suggest the Pixel phone is likely to start at $649, the same price Apple charges for its iPhone 7. This would be a significant departure from Google, which charged $499 for the high-end Nexus 6P when it debuted a year ago. One other aspect of the new Pixel phones we think Google will emphasize when it unveils the devices involves the Daydream virtual reality platform unveiled by the company earlier this year. Google says Daydream-compliant phones will need to meet some pretty high standards to reassure app makers that devices will be able to handle the VR experiences they come up with. You would imagine phones carrying Google branding to meet those standards. Daydream VR Headset What We Know: When Google talked up Daydream at its developer conference this year, it didn't just focus on phones. The company also said it would release reference designs for a Daydream headset and controller that hardware partners could use. But the company also revealed that it planned to make a Daydream headset and controller of its own. What We Think We Know: If headsets and controllers are to join Daydream-ready phones in arriving before the end of 2016 as Google promised, this seems like the perfect time to introduce us to whatever VR hardware is in the works. In fact, Android Police says that's exactly what Google is planning to do at its Oct. 4 event, with the headset possibly being called the Daydream View. Other than that, we haven't heard much about Google's planned headset, other than it will be a more sophisticated version of Google Cardboard that taps into features within Android Nougat such as low latency support and high-quality head tracking. The headset will also work with a handheld controller that features a trackpad and two buttons — a home button and one that developers can use for whatever Daydream apps they build. Google Home What We Know: Daydream wasn't the only thing Google talked up at its developer conference. The company also touted a new speaker called Google Home that will powered by Google Assistant, a voice-controlled virtual assistant that can control connected devices, perform searches and control music playback. We saw a video of Google Home in action during Google's developer conference and executives holding it up on stage, but we haven't had any hands-on time with the device. Google Home What We Think We Know: That could likely change on Oct. 4, when Google could at least tell us how much Google Home will cost and when it will ship. (Android Police puts the price at $129, which would be less expensive than the Amazon Echo.) If we're lucky, we may even get to see some of its voice-powered functionality up close. And maybe Google will be able to explain why we would opt for this voice-powered speaker over Amazon's already popular voice-powered speaker, especially when the Amazon Echo's Alexa voice assistant already boasts 3,000 skills such as ordering a pizza, checking on the weather, looking up recipes and booking rides on Uber. MORE: Amazon Alexa Guide: Tips, Tricks and How-Tos Chromecast in 4K What We Know: Like the Nexus phones, the Chromecast 2 made its debut last year, adding more ways to find streaming content to watch. And with the holiday season coming up, it could be time for Google to come out with an updated version of its pluggable streaming device. What We Think We Know: Could it be time to add 4K to the streaming stick mix? It would give Chromecast a leg up on competing products from Roku and Amazon, which offer 4K support in their set-top boxes but not in their streaming stick products. And that's exactly what Google appears to be planning based on the rumors. VentureBeat published leaked photos of the new Chromecast, which will reportedly be called the Chromecast Ultra. It retains the Chromecast 2's circular design, but opts for an all-black look with a "G" logo stamped on the front. It will reportedly have the ability to take 4K content on a mobile device and stream it to a TV or display with an HDMI port. That same Android Police report that puts a price tag on Google Home says the Chromecast Ultra will sell for $69 — nearly twice what you'd pay for a Chromecast 2. Reportedly, Google will keep that 1080p-capable streaming stick on the market for users who don't have a need for a 4K-capable device. A New Router What We Know: Google's already in the router game with the Google OnHub, a networking device that prizes simplicity. Google doesn't actually make the OnHub itself, leaving that task to Asus and TP-Link, which make different versions of the $200 router. What We Think We Know: Android Police has the scoop here, with a source telling the website that Google will start making its own router. Reportedly called the Google Wifi, the device is expected to adopt many of the OnHub's features; it could also offer mesh networking features in which you use multiple devices to extend the range of your Wi-Fi network throughout the home. Google WiFi could have one notable advantage over the existing OnHub router: Android Police says it will cost $129. MORE: Best Routers Other Hardware What We Know: If past results are any indication of future events, Google trotted out the Pixel C convertible tablet the last time it introduced new phones and a Chromecast update. It's possible that the company could have some other hardware in the works — maybe another tablet, maybe a Chromebook update — though the Oct. 4 lineup is already looking pretty crowded should all the above rumors come to pass. What We Think We Know: Packed lineup or not, Google's allegedly working on a 12.3-inch laptop that will run a hybrid Android/Chrome OS called Andromeda. Android Police broke that story last week, though it also said the touchscreen laptop wouldn't be out until the third quarter of 2017. That would suggest it won't be on the agenda this Tuesday. A tweet last week by Hiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president of Android, Chrome OS and Play has people thinking Google has *something* planned, though. Posting on the eighth anniversary of Google's Android announcement, Lockheimer said he had "a feeling 8 years from now, we'll be talking about Oct. 4, 2016." Whether that's alluding to some sort of Android/Chrome mash-up, a follow-up on the news from earlier this year that Android apps are coming to Chromebooks or something else altogether will become clear once Google executives hit the stage at Tuesday's event.

Google Launching Home AI Competitor To “Accidental Winner” Amazon Echo This Week Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Launching Home AI Competitor To “Accidental Winner” Amazon Echo This Week October 3, 2016 10:52 am EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc your house talks back amazon amazon echo amazon alexa Alexa google Google Home internet of things smart home alphabet If growing up on Star Trek: The Next Generation reruns taught us anything, it’s that the future would be brought to us by computers that could recognize our voice commands and do whatever we asked. And while none of the products on the market today sound like the late Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, we are still surrounded by machine-generated female voices that answer our questions, queue up our favorite tunes, and dim our room lights on request. But the dominant player in that space is one that, just a few years ago, nobody would have expected — because it’s Amazon, not Google, connecting homes. Google is planning to unveil its connected-home, smart, talking hub — Google Home — on Thursday. But, as the New York Times reports, Amazon has spent the last several years getting there first… and that puts Google in the rare position of trying to play catch-up on intelligent tech. It all started with the Amazon Echo. The smart speaker, which showcased Amazon’s Alexa “assistant” software, launched just in time for holiday 2014 and proved surprisingly popular. Since then, Amazon has consistently added new features and skills to Alexa’s repertoire. Amazon also continues to expand Alexa to new devices and to enter partnerships with other companies, like Sonos, to bring their devices into Alexa’s purview. Amazon has also been expanding its hardware into teeny tiny Echo Dots that can be put basically anywhere in your home. Since September, Amazon even sells them in six- and 12-packs — yes, like beer — so that you can put one in every room fairly effortlessly. That means Amazon has a two-year head start on Google, which is officially unveiling Google Home in an event on Thursday. (The company first announced back in May but it is the modern way of things that the first tease is not the true unveiling.) Google Home, which the NYT describes (not inaccurately) as looking “a little like an air freshener,” is expected to go on sale in the coming weeks in order to be on store shelves and in Christmas stockings for holiday 2016. Rather than picking a lady-name — like Cortana, Siri, or Alexa — Google for now is calling its AI “The Assistant.” (If this calls to mind for you images of Doctor Who companions, well, you’re not alone.) The Assistant has already been built into one Google messaging app, and the company plans to continue to add it to new hardware going forward. Experts, though, are kind of baffled that Amazon managed to beat Google to the punch. The retailer, the NYT notes, has a “notoriously uneven” track record. For every success like Kindle or Prime, there’s a whole trash heap of unwanted Fire Phones. That leads one expert to call Amazon the “accidental winner,” in connected digital assistants, adding, “Amazon got there first, which is superimpressive, and it has been a huge hit.” Google hasn’t necessarily been resting on its laurels, analysts note, but it is facing strong competition on almost every front: self-driving cars, web-hosting services, home entertainment tech, phone hardware — in basically everything except search, someone, somewhere, is queuing up to take a bite out of the tech giant’s plans.

This latest build is the third from Google and brings the smartwatch platform one step closer to its general release. Google added some killer new features to the operating system, but not all the news is good. First, the good news: Android Wear now has its very own version of the Google Play Store. Google says Play Store for Android Wear will allow smartwatch owners to browse and search for apps using voice, keyboard, handwriting, and recommended queries. Moreover, users can switch between multiple accounts, join beta testing, and update/uninstall apps directly from their wrist. Google says Android Wear 2.0 negates the need for phone-based apps, so users can install apps directly to the watch with no phone companion. Yes, that means developers can now build and publish watch-only apps. The idea here is to make it easier for users to discover and download apps.  "We asked developers what [they] wanted most out of Android Wear, and [they] told us [they] wanted to make it easier for users to discover apps," explained Google in a blog post. "So we ran studies with users to find out where they expected and wanted to discover apps––and they repeatedly looked for and asked for a way to discover apps right on the watch itself. Along with improvements to app discovery on the phone and Web, the Play Store on the watch helps users find apps right where they need them." This is a huge step forward for the platform.  Google has published documentation for developers that provides all the details they need to make their apps available on Play Store for Android Wear. For starters, developers will need to make sure their apps are set to minSDK Version 24 or higher, use the runtime permissions model, and upload via the multi-APK tool in the Play Developer Console.  In addition to the Play Store, Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview 3 also makes improvements to complications, adds inline actions for notifications, and smart replies. The preview is more strict about enforcing permissions in the complications console, but has eased the process of doing so. The refreshed complications tools also allow watch face developers to set default complications that don't require user permissions, such battery life or step counts. The WearableRecyclerView console helps developers create vertical lists and other UI components that work equally well on rectangular and round watch faces. Android Wear now creates Smart Reply responses for messaging notifications entirely on the watch thanks to machine learning.  The inline notifications tool is handled by a new API, according to Google. The API allows apps to take action on notifications right from the info stream. Moreover, developers can specify which actions are displayed at the bottom of the notification via the API call. In order to get started, developers will need to install a beta version of the Android Wear app on their phone, flash their watch to the latest preview release, and then use the phone app to add a Google Account to the watch. Detailed directions are available here. (Developers who don't have Android Wear devices on hand can use the software emulator.)  Now for the bad news. Google has pushed back the general release of Android Wear 2.0 from the fourth quarter of 2016 to "early 2017." Technically, Google never provided an actual, intended release date for Android Wear 2.0, though it strongly implied the platform would become available during the fall months. Looks like we'll all be waiting until winter.  About the author: Eric Zeman I am a journalist who covers the mobile telecommunications industry.

Kate DwyerOct 3, 2016 10:43AM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestCarphone Warehouse via Android Central A leak of the Google Pixel phone specs and photos was just released by a UK phone retailer called Carphone Warehouse, as was reported by Android Central. The published pages arrived just a day before the company's scheduled keynote, where many speculated the phone would be unveiled, The Verge reports. The Pixel is Google's first foray into manufacturing hardware, and photos show the phone's camera, what seems to be a fingerprint scanner on the back, and a body that is split between matte and polished material. The phone likely works with Live Cases, which previously worked with the Nexus 6, 5X, and 6P (phones previously running Google software.) The phone reportedly comes with a range of Google software including free unlimited photo storage on Google Photos, and the Duo video chat app and Allo messaging app. The major difference between this phone and the Nexus line is the Google Assistant, which is basically Google's answer to Siri. Some, including Edward Snowden, have expressed concerns over the Assistant's A.I. capabilities; in order for the Assistant to learn more about you to offer "smart replies" during Allo chats, it must gather and analyze your data. The phone is available in two sizes: the Pixel, with a 5-inch display, and the Pixel XL, with a 5.5-inch display. They are reportedly exactly the same in every other way, and contain a battery you can quick-charge in 15 minutes. You'll likely be able to choose between 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, just like the iPhone 7, although there's no word about a 64 GB option. 9to5Google reports that the specs in the UK leak are likely generic, so we'll have to wait until tomorrow for the official information.

Microsoft bids $44.6 billion for Yahoo 0 Share: Tech Industry by Ina Fried February 1, 2008 11:27 AM PST Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy Microsoft went public Friday with a $44.6 billion cash-and-stock bid to acquire Yahoo. In its response, Yahoo called the Microsoft bid "unsolicited" but did not reject it. Microsoft's offer, which was contained in the letter to Yahoo's board, amounts to $31 a share and represents a 62 percent premium over Yahoo's closing price on Thursday. Microsoft said it will offer shareholders the option of cash or stock. "We have great respect for Yahoo, and together, we can offer an increasingly exciting set of solutions for consumers, publishers, and advertisers while becoming better positioned to compete in the online-services market," Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in a statement. News.com Poll Should Microsoft be allowed to buy Yahoo? Yes. Google is a monopolistic threat to Microsoft. No. I like things just the way they are. View results Yahoo said in a responding statement that its board "will evaluate this proposal carefully and promptly, in the context of Yahoo's strategic plans, and pursue the best course of action to maximize long-term value for shareholders." The deal comes as Microsoft and Yahoo have both struggled to compete against Google. Microsoft didn't mention Google by name in its announcement, but it did indicate that its acquisition bid was aimed squarely at its rival. "Today, the market is increasingly dominated by one player, who is consolidating its dominance through acquisition," Microsoft said. "Together, Microsoft and Yahoo can offer a credible alternative." In a conference call Friday morning, Ballmer said that Microsoft and Yahoo "really do share a vision for the potential of online services." Microsoft said in its statement that it believes that it can get all of the needed regulatory approvals and that the deal, if ultimately approved by Yahoo shareholders, could be completed in the second half of the year. Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research, said it's "clear that there is increased pressure on Microsoft from Google, and they recognize that. Way back when, Yahoo wasn't that interested in a Microsoft deal. What a difference two years make. Microsoft has a pile of money, and Yahoo has experienced problems of its own. Ballmer, in the past, has historically not loved these types of deals. It is indicative of how different the world is now." Gartenberg added that the deal "absolutely" makes sense. "But there is a lot to be done in the details. Getting this deal done might be the easiest part. The real challenge is what happens when they finish the deal. This is not a panacea--the details will be what matters," he said. Rumors that Microsoft was interested in Yahoo have bubbled up from time to time, including the past two springs, on the eve of Microsoft advertising conferences. The move would be by far the largest acquisition ever for Microsoft. Its largest prior deal, also in the online-advertising space, was last year's $6 billion deal to acquire Aquantive. Asked on the conference call why Microsoft still needs Yahoo after buying Aquantive, Ballmer pointed to Yahoo's reach with consumers. "Certainly from a consumer perspective, there's no better way to increase scale and capacity than this acquisition," Ballmer said. Microsoft also pointed to the intense investments needed in data centers and technology needed to compete with Google. "Scale matters," said Kevin Johnson, president of the Microsoft division that houses Windows and online advertising. "Some of the scale economics can kick in rather rapidly." Ultimately, Ballmer said, the deal should help Microsoft become profitable in online advertising. "We've been losing money," Ballmer said. "Our plan would be to not lose money in the future." In a letter sent to Yahoo's board late Thursday, Microsoft confirmed that it has had talks with Yahoo since 2006 but that its suggestions of an acquisition had been rebuffed. "In late 2006 and early 2007, we jointly explored a broad range of ways in which our two companies might work together," Microsoft said. "These discussions were based on a vision that the online businesses of Microsoft and Yahoo should be aligned in some way to create a more effective competitor in the online marketplace. We discussed a number of alternatives ranging from commercial partnerships to a merger proposal, which you rejected." The letter goes on to say that an offer in February 2007 was also rejected. Although at one time, Microsoft was open to other kinds of partnerships with Yahoo, the company says now it just wants to own Yahoo outright. "While a commercial partnership may have made sense at one time, Microsoft believes that the only alternative now is the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo that we are proposing," Microsoft said in the letter. In the conference call, Ballmer said that when Microsoft first talked to Yahoo more than a year ago, it believed that a merger would have benefits to both companies. "We believe now in those benefits more than ever," Ballmer said. The public offer follows Yahoo's disappointing earnings report on Tuesday, which sent the company's shares down. Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang said Tuesday that the company is facing "headwinds." He also announced 1,000 layoffs. Terry Semel, Yahoo's former CEO, who left that position last summer but remained as nonexecutive chairman of the board, left the company altogether on Thursday. Microsoft's move validates Yahoo's value and could bring out other prospective buyers, said Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Land. However, Microsoft doesn't have enough of a plan as to how it would integrate Yahoo into the company, he said. Unlike with Microsoft's Aquantive and Tellme acquisitions, Microsoft and its Live brands have a lot of overlap with Yahoo, including e-mail, portal, advertising, and search. "Microsoft suffers in that they are conflicted over two different brands, and now they're going to have to be conflicted over three," Sullivan said. "If Microsoft wants to be a leader in search, this is a way for them to climb up and be No. 2 against Google. And it validates that Yahoo isn't a loser. It's a company that's worth a lot of money." A merger might give Google some extra competition, but it wouldn't unseat it as the top search provider, and it would take some time to convince advertisers that they would do better on a Microsoft-Yahoo platform over Google's highly successful ad business, said Mark Mahaney of Citigroup. "If Yahoo wants to remain independent, it will need to show investors that it is willing to take radical, value-creating steps," and outsourcing search to Google is one of its few options, Mahaney wrote in a research note. Imran Khan of J.P. Morgan Securities thinks that regulators will approve the deal. "Yahoo is better off inside a larger company with (a) strong balance sheet and technology," Khan wrote in a research note. A merger of Microsoft and Yahoo could give them the scale, in terms of search traffic, that they need to compete against Google and provide a boost on the ad side, he added. "A combination of Yahoo's relationships (with DSL providers), and Microsoft's applications and devices, could create a very well positioned potential competitor," Khan wrote.

Since the introduction of 'witty' Google Assistant, the battle of AI has become more intense. It has also intensified the long-running tech clash between Google and Apple. Like them or not, voice-activated assistants have become a standard on smartphones, and now desktops. They allow us to control our devices hands-free and offer a speedy alternative to typing queries. SEE ALSO: Big Sale Up to 80% Off Amazon Great Indian Festival Sale: Offers on Speaker, LED TV, And More Although all do the same thing, each has its own set of quirks that makes it unique. To spice things up a little, here's a comparison between the much-favoured Siri and the newly launched Google Assistant to show how the latter may just be the better choice. Click Here for New Android Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! #1 More Engaging Just type 'I am Bored' and wait for the replies you'll get from both the assistants. As seen in the picture, while Siri gives its 'one-liners' like I am not amused (So mean of Siri!), but Google Assistant instantly tells you a joke or gives you gaming options. #2 More Informative If you verse a line of poetry and ask who is the writer to both Siri and Google Assistant, the latter shows more interest to ask follow up questions followed by your initial questions. Whereas, Siri will stop after just answering your question. For example, we have asked who sang Teenage Dreams? While Siri answers Katy Perry while Google Assistant gives you options if you want to know about its net worth, her age, her height, etc. Click Here for New Android Smartphones Best Online Deals #3 Auto-Response Imagine you're caught with works and unable to reply to a text you've got from someone. Your virtual Google Assistant can auto reply to the text. But Siri doesn't have any such option. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals #4 Google is more Diplomatic While it was evident that the introduction of Google Assistant will bring the question of contest with Siri, hence its is pre-configured to remain diplomatic with questions like 'Are You Better than Siri?' #5 Siri is exclusive to iPhones Google Assistant has a more wide reach considering that it is compatible with both Android and iOS but on the other side Siri is exclusive to Apple.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Oct 3, 2016 at 10:04AM AT&T (NYSE:T) has abruptly ended a controversial billing policy where it charged customers an extra monthly fee if they did not want to have their internet usage monitored. Called "Internet Preferences," the program was part of the company's Google Fiber rival, GigaPower. That product competes with the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) service offering high-speed internet, pay television, and phone service.  AT&T's differed from Google's in that customers for GigaPower had to use Internet Preferences to opt out of having their online usage monitored by the company in order to serve them targeted ads. Users who chose to opt out had to pay $29 a month for stand-alone internet access while bundles including TV or phone service could cost more than $60 extra when customers opted out, according to Ars Tecnica. AT&T pricing varied based on what Google charged in each market and it generally priced its overall service, including opting out, more in markets where the rival service did not operate. AT&T made people pay to opt out of having their data tracked. Image source: AT&T. What did AT&T change? AT&T told Ars: "To simplify our offering for our customers, we plan to end the optional Internet Preferences advertising program related to our fastest internet speed tiers. ... As a result, all customers on these tiers will receive the best rate we have available for their speed tier in their area. We'll begin communicating this update to customers early next week." Ars reports that data collection and ad targeting will be turned off. Why is AT&T doing this? The company has not given a reason for its actions, but the program was always controversial. Earlier this year, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began considering new rules that would place restrictions on the data internet service providers (ISPs) collect. The ISPs have been against these rules, arguing that companies like Facebook and Netflix collect data in order to shape user experience or (in the case of the social media site) serve ads. Members of the FCC argue that consumers can choose to use or not use a social or streaming service, but in most cases, they have very limited choice when it comes to ISPs. AT&T took part in those hearings, but argued against the characterization of its policy as "pay for privacy." Instead, the company's regulatory affairs executive, Jacquelyne Flemming, framed it in a different way, Consumerist reported. "We, AT&T, have a broadband Internet access service that we market to customers that if you agree, if you opt-in, to the use of your data for various reasons, then you get a discount," Flemming said. "That doesn't mean that other people who don't get the discount are paying for privacy. I wouldn't say that." While she wouldn't say it, that was exactly how the program worked. "I think that there is a benefit to the customer, and it's not as if we're talking [all] broadband Internet access services, of which there are a wide range of them that are available to customers. In this particular instance, if you like to get this benefit, then there is a reciprocal benefit to the customer and the company," she said, Consumerist reported. AT&T made the right call While it's easy to question the company's motives and it's very likely dropping these extra charges ahead of any rule changes made by the FCC, at least AT&T is making the move. Letting customers opt in or out of data collection makes sense, but charging for it creates a market where privacy becomes something reserved for wealthier people. This was a smart change that may cost the company some money in the short term, but that cash was not worth the bad publicity that would come if the FCC had to force this change.

Baidu’s new TalkType keyboard app emphasizes voice input over typing Posted Oct 3, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story MIT’s new 3D-printed, shock-absorbent materials make for resilient drones Typing on small screens can still be challenging, but today’s keyboard apps still focus on text entry over speech, despite the advances in voice-based computing and the increasing accuracy of speech recognition technology. Baidu wants to change that, with a new keyboard app called TalkType that prioritizes voice input over typing. The app was developed by Baidu Research, the Silicon Valley and Beijing-based division of Chinese search company Baidu, and the app will compete with similar third-party keyboards from both Google and Microsoft. While search apps like Google’s have placed the microphone more prominently in an effort to increase people’s usage of voice input, keyboard apps still generally default to a traditional alphanumeric text input interface. TalkType is different because it places a large microphone front-and-center in the application. That’s not to say it gives up the keyboard, by any means – naturally, there are still times when it makes more sense to type than talk, but the app’s user interface makes voice the starting point and first option. “TalkType is the first full-function smartphone keyboard that is ‘voice first,’ not ‘voice also,'” explains Bijit Halder, project leader in Baidu Research’s Silicon Valley AI Lab, in an announcement about the launch. “Unlike conventional smartphone keyboard designs, where voice is targeted for occasional use and delegated to a small mic icon, TalkType is designed to make voice the primary mode,” he says. Using voice input, you can not only turn your speech into text, you can also use voice commands to add punctuation to your sentences, like “comma,” “period,” “question mark,” and “exclamation point.” The app also offers word suggestions as you speak. You can select single words or multiple words or sentences, moving either one or two fingers across the app’s trackpad.   While the traditional keyboard may be de-emphasized in the new app, it’s not diminished. It supports multiple text entry methods, including swipe. It also includes emojis and a “QuickShare” feature that lets you more easily send rich media through the app, like GIFs (powered by Giphy) or location information, like restaurants or shops from Yelp, among other things. You can also share your current location with a friend via the app, and the company says the feature will be expanded with more functionality over time. QuickShare brings to mind the integrated search and sharing capabilities found in Gboard, Google’s first mobile keyboard application. Similar to TalkType, Gboard lets you pull up restaurants, and other business info, then text it to friends. Integrated GIF sharing is included as well, as is a Google search engine for sharing other news, flight info, weather, and more. Microsoft also recently rolled out the same feature set to its keyboard, Word Flow. But both Microsoft and Google’s apps focus on touch-based input – Microsoft with an innovative “wheel” interface for one-handed typing, for example. Baidu’s TalkType instead starts you with voice, then allows you to navigate between different input methods – like speech, alphabet, symbols, and emoji – via its Quick Action bar. Here, you’ll also find other important buttons, like the return and delete keys. You can also customize the app using built-in themes. TalkType was developed by Baidu Research, which is led by Chief Scientist Dr. Andrew Ng. Dr. Ng, a leading machine learning and deep learning expert. Dr. Ng previously co-developed Google Brain, a large-scale deep learning system built on top of Google’s cloud computing infrastructure. At Baidu since 2014, Dr. Ng has been working on Deep Speech, a deep learning-based speech recognition system. The company says that Deep Speech can be nearly three times faster and even more accurate than typing, citing a recent study from Stanford, University of Washington and Baidu Research. The study pitted Deep Speech’s results against a group of texters ages 19 to 32, who were entering text on their iPhones by hand. Baidu Research has released other projects, like an AR platform DuSee and AI assistant Duer, but never a keyboard. With the keyboard, Baidu claims sensitive information like emails and passwords entered via typing never leave the device, but the voice data is sent over a secure connection for transcription, as is a standard practice. This data is never shared, the company says. TalkType, which was previously available to preview in its unfinished state, is a free download on Google Play. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Baidu Founded 1999 Overview Baidu is a Chinese website and search engine that enables individuals to obtain information and find what they need.

Competition regulators on the continent charged in April that deals requiring Google’s search and browser applications to be installed on Android phones in exchange for accessing other products broke the rules. They argue that it allows the company to bolster and maintain its dominant position in the search market. ADVERTISEMENT Reuters reported on Monday that officials have extended the deadline for Google to respond to the charges to Oct. 31 from Sept. 20. The move came at Google’s request. The previous extension was granted in early September. Google, now a division of holding company Alphabet, is facing three sets of antitrust charges in Europe. They have also been accused of violating competition rules in cases related to their comparison shopping service and online advertising business. The deadlines for them to reply in both of those cases are also currently scheduled for October. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has aggressively pursued American firms, including the tech sector. That included a recent decision to make Apple pay billions of dollars in back taxes. United States officials have decried that move, and Vestager met with lawmakers during a visit to Washington last month. But she’s long said that she doesn’t hold a bias against U.S. firms. “As I said, the nationality of a company is a nonrelevant fact,” she said just over a year ago. “Nonetheless, some claim that when our casework involves giants like Apple or Google, [it] is an evidence of bias. But this is a fallacy.”   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa. View the discussion thread.

It's not going to happen immediately — automakers and tech companies are still testing prototypes. But, in a shift, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles said in a revision of draft regulations released late Friday that the most advanced self-driving cars would no longer be required to have a licensed driver if federal officials deem them safe enough. The redrafted regulations will be the subject of a public hearing Oct. 19 in Sacramento. The DMV has been wrestling for several years with how to oversee the emerging technology. In December, the agency released an initial draft of self-driving car regulations that required a licensed driver in any self-driving vehicle. The industry reacted with great disappointment, as the ultimate vision of many companies is a car that has no wheel or pedals. That approach is based on the argument that humans are not very good at driving, and anyway cannot be relied on as a backup to a car that typically drives itself but might fail in a way that required a person in the driver's seat who might be distracted or even asleep to snap to attention. The DMV's new document coincides with the release last week of a 112-page federal proposal under which any self-driving car should pass a 15-point safety assessment before the public can get ahold of it. Among other things, the safety assessment asks automakers to document how the car detects and avoids objects and pedestrians, how hardened it is against cyberattacks and what how its backup systems will cope should the software fail. In incorporating the federal approach, California dropped a proposal that a third-party company certify the safety of self-driving cars. The new draft regulations released Friday include several other new provisions. Among them is wording that would prohibit advertising vehicles with lower levels of automation — such as Tesla Motors' Autopilot, which on divided highways can keep a car's lane, brake and accelerate on the understanding that a person is paying attention all the time — from being advertised as "autonomous" or "self-driving." The company that stands to gain the most from the state's embrace of cars without a wheel or pedals is Alphabet, where the Google self-driving car project envisions cars that allow no human control other than a start and emergency stop button. A spokesman for the Google self-driving car project did not have a comment Friday on the changes to the proposed regulations.

Here are 15 tips to keep in mind when writing for the web. There’s no need to think of Google every time you’re writing a new post, but it’s still useful to understand what makes a piece of content effective, both in social and search results. Here are some quick tips to consider when writing your next post. Feel free to copy-paste them, write them down, bookmark the page, or memorise them. 1. Title A title has to be descriptive, but also concise. Google only displays the first 55-60 characters of a title tag, which means that an ideal length is approximately 55 characters, to make sure you don’t see your title cut off on SERPs. Think of your title as a preview to your content. As this will be the first impression of it, you need to maximise the chances of a click to the site, and a powerful title can certainly be very effective. There’s no need to rely on clickbait titles to increase your traffic, as this may not be appreciated by readers, which will eventually harm your long-term audience. Facebook recently announced that it will penalise clickbait posts with a reduced news feed reach, due to a new algorithm update. This is an attempt to make publishers understand that there’s no need to be vague, misleading, or controversial to lure new audience to your site, especially when the quality is not satisfactory to your promises. There are still many ways to increase your traffic, but still respect your audience and a closer look at your recent topics and what led to their success could help you understand even more science of the headline. 2. Headings Headings are both important for the structure of the page, but also for SEO. They can help Google understand the main topic of a post and thus, facilitate the ranking process. Subheadings can improve the browsing experience for readers, helping them scan a longer post and guide them through the rest of the article. You may use all the heading elements, from H1 to H6, depending on their usability, the type of the text, and its length, while you can also use more than one H1 heading, if you feel that it boosts the reading experience. Consistency is also important in all your posts and the way you use headings, in order to help search engines understand the way you use them. 3. Add value It may sound obvious, but it’s still important to conduct the necessary research for your topics to get a deeper understanding of it, but also to spot the right content gap you want to fill. Every piece of content should add value, while it is also useful to focus on relevance and consistency, taking your target audience into consideration before deciding on your next topic. 4. Decide on the length The length of the content varies depending on the industry, the reason it’s created, the audience, or even the available time. Longer content may increase the chances of search engine optimisation, but this doesn’t mean that you can’t create content of less than 1000 words. It’s better to have several posts of more than 300 words to keep your content fresh, consistent and relevant, rather than creating less content to focus on its length. The more content you have, the higher the chances to boost your ranking on SERPs. 5. Aim for more time spent on site The time readers spend on your content indicates whether you can grab their attention and convince them to read more of your content. One of the metrics that defines the success of content is the time readers spend on it. If the bounce rate is high and they only spend a few seconds on it, it means that you have fewer chances to convert them into loyal readers and eventually visitors. However, if they spend fice or more minutes at the page, it is an indication that they are really interested in the topic and they want to thoroughly read about it. You can increase the time readers spend on your content by improving the quality of it, focusing on its relevance to the audience and adding value to what’s already available. 6. Focus on quality Quality content is not just about increasing the time spent on the site, it is also about building your reputation as an authority to your field. This is a useful way to increase trust with your audience and use your content to build new relationships. There’s no need to sacrifice quality over quantity, as your content serves as the best way to boost your credibility and thus, your ranking in SERPs. 7. Pick a keyword There’s an old myth regarding keyword density and whether you should focus on it, or not. As SEO changes year by year, keywords should not be your priority when creating content, but they still serve as a starting point when picking a topic, but also as a useful SEO ally when using them properly. Google may focus more on the context, rather than the specific keywords, which means that quality and relevance become important, but you can still use a focus keyword in your title and your text. Just make sure you’re not using it way too often, ruining the text’s readability. 8. Optimise content for social sharing By the time your content is ready, it’s time to focus on its optimisation to ensure that you increase the chances of its distribution. It’s not enough to write good content if it doesn’t reach the target audience. Optimisation may include the right headline, the proper image, the caption that will be used in social media, the use of the right social platforms, the hashtags that could be included, or the planning of the social posts. It’s all about understanding both your content and your audience to excel both in creation and distribution.

Meta tags (title and meta description) affect the traffic your content will have from search results, which means that it’s vital to optimise them as much as possible to be both clear and effective. If you’re using WordPress, it’s easy to control your meta description with a plug-in, like Yoast, to create the best version that previews your content. It’s the meta description that may influence a user whether to click on a page or not,  affecting the CTR and thus, the success of your content. Here are some good and bad examples of meta descriptions if you need further help. 10. Think of the target audience This is another obvious point, but it’s still vital. Content cannot be successful if it doesn’t meet the requirements of its target audience. There should be a great understanding of what the audience expects from you, which questions they want answered, and how you can help them. Start by analysing your existing content and how the audience responded. What worked and what could be improved? Is there a post that went surprisingly well? How is the social interaction to your posts and which content got most links to it?  11. Test readability The readability of your content may affect the time readers spend on your page, which as we mentioned, it affects the value your content has. There are many sites and tools (example) to test your readability score. You don’t have to spend too much time on them to learn how to make the structure of your content simple and clear. You may still use it as an indicator of what you could improve.  12. Test your SEO You don’t have to be an SEO expert to check your content’s potential success in search rankings. If you’re using WordPress for example, tools like Yoast SEO, SEO by SQUIRRLY, or SEO Control Center can indicate what you need to improve, while they also help you expand your knowledge in search engine optimisation. For example, you can learn whether your focus keyword is used properly on the key sections of your text (heading, url, meta description). You can also learn about the keyword density, and whether you need to use your focus keyword more, always in a natural way as part of the text. Moreover, SEO by SQUIRRLY for example has the option of SEO Live Assistant, which is exactly what it promises to be, your live assistant in real time, while you’re writing your post. This may help you learn more about optimisation and create content both for humans and search engines. 13. Think of the visual element It’s rare to see a piece of content without any images, and there’s no reason not to add them when they can provide further information and help with the content’s readability. Visual content helps with the formatting of the text, its optimisation (both for SEO and social media), but it’s also a useful way to engage with the quick readers, the ones that prefer to skim the content rather than just read it. That’s why infographics became popular over the past years, as they are informative, but still appealing. Thus, your visual content can stand on its own, or serve as an enhancement to your written text. In both cases, make sure there is a reason you add it. Visual content is not just about aesthetics, it should have a value and a justified reason of existence. Need help with SEO tweaking for your images? Here’s a useful guide to image SEO. 14. Add links Don’t be afraid to add links, whether they are internal or external. There’s no need to link to every single post you come across, but it’s still useful to showcase your references. It’s not just about crediting the source, but it’s also about helping Google rank your blog. Outbound linking should indicate that you help the reader expand the knowledge on the topic with more useful posts. Google will also appreciate your dedication to the topic and the audience. Beware, users are becoming suspicious with links. Internal linking is also important, as it helps you build authority and offer further value with previous content you may have written. This helps Google “crawl” your key topics and thus, rank you accordingly to these. And of course, you need to ensure that links open in new windows. 15. Proofread and edit Not everyone is good at catching all the mistakes in a piece of content. If you feel that editing is not your strongest part, find the right tool, or ask for a professional’s help. Quality is crucial and it also affects the authority of your content, so you certainly cannot overlook it.

Image: Clarifai When you have a photo and want to find a higher resolution copy online, you can use tools like Google Image Search and TinEye. They work in a very specific way extracting specific patterns and how they contrast with their surroundings. That works well for finding alternate copies of the same image, but it’s not so great if you try to go deeper. Enter Clarifai, which creator Matthew Zeiler claims improves upon the techniques used by Google and Tineye by way of superior artificial intelligence. “We understand images and video automatically with a whole variety of different ‘models’ as we call them,” Zeiler explained to Motherboard. “In our demo, you can throw in an image and get different predictions from the models.” By default, the demo on its website uses its “general” model, which is designed for everyday photos that the average person would take with their phone. While Clarifai is primarily a web services company, they have an iPhone app for the average consumer to help get their name out. “If you take your phone out of your pocket and take a picture of the world, it should give you meaningful stuff back.” The tags that Clarifai outputs aren’t just naming the objects it sees, but can get pretty descriptive. During my chat with the Clarifai team, I pulled up the demo and fed it the “Colin Powell pretending to play guitar at Bohemian Grove” photo that was leaked with his hacked emails. Being both obscure and low-resolution, it seemed like a pretty solid test of their capabilities. Getting tags like “music,” “performance,” “guitar,” and “stringed instrument” wasn’t necessarily surprising. But I found myself really impressed with one tag in particular, “festival,” because Clarifai was able to discern that it was looking at an outdoor stage setup. Image: Clarifai Last week, Clarifai added two new features, which they’ve dubbed “Custom Training” and “Visual Search.” These go hand in hand: Custom Training allows you to “teach” Clarifai to associated photos, while Visual Search “allows any user to easily organize, access, or recommend their images or products by visual similarity and/or keyword.” In a way, the most impressive part may not even but the underlying AI tech in and of itself, but how fast and, once again, specific it is. Everything you do with Clarifai is almost instantaneous, whether it’s giving you keywords or using its new features to group photos together. When you feed Clarifai examples of various photos that fit a given criteria, it immediately finds other similar photos. “This is not the web data, this is your data,” Zeiler explained. “So you as a retailer can put in your product photos, or you as a social media site can put in your social media photos, or a consumer can put in their own photos. It indexes all of that and can learn from your data.” To illustrate this, Zeiler pulls up some photos of sneakers. After selecting just a small handful of Converse brand shoes, Clarifai immediately populated the results with all of the other Converse photos in its database, because it could distinguish the company’s trademark style. This even extended to some of Converse’s non-sneaker footwear, as a few stray pairs of Converse boots showed up in the results. Similarly, but more abstract, when Zeiler started choosing what he called “treeshoe” photos of shoes alongside trees, Clarifai immediately narrowed it down to other “treeshoe” photos. Clarifai’s iPhone app can also do this with your personal photos Instead of tagging each photo to reflect who’s in it, you can teach it with a few photos of the same person, and then it will group all photos of that person together. That’s a time saver, and even if, in the long run, Clarifai is making its money providing services to other websites, you can see it being what they will become known for by the average person. “The thing I’m most excited about with this is it opens up this technology for everybody out there,” Zeiler explained. “We don’t care if it’s our own applications that go directly to users, or through the great companies developing on our platform. We want to get it out to everyone on the planet.” Topics: search, search engines, Clarifai, ai, algorithms, TinEye, google, Futures Contact the author by Twitter.

If Google price its next two flagship smartphones in the same ballpark as Apple and Samsung, the company could give tech buyers some pause. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | October 3, 2016 -- 13:16 GMT (06:16 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Image: Google Google on Tuesday is expected to unveil its latest flagship Android devices, ditch the Nexus brand and roll out smartphones called Pixel. The big change here is that Google is putting its brand front and center as a hardware maker. What's the Google brand worth on the hardware front? We'll find out if pricing rumors are on target. The specs and announcements--two Pixel smartphones, details about Google Home, Google Wi-Fi and other goodies--have mostly leaked. Google Pixel and Pixel XL said to be leaked by Carphone Warehouse | Google's October hardware event: Pixel smartphones, 4K Chromecast, and more | Google's Pixel, Pixel XL allegedly leak ahead of October event | The one thing Google and the rest of us can learn from Apple about hype | CNET: What to expect from Google's October 4 event But the most interesting item for me is the pricing. Google will reportedly price the Pixel phones starting at $649, according to Android Police. That price point puts Google's smartphones on par with those from Apple and Samsung. Note that Android Police has a few caveats about its pricing report. In either case, Google has used more aggressive pricing in the past and has positioned its devices more in the value category. Should the Pixel XL start at $649 it'll directly compete with the likes of Samsung and Apple. Would you buy Google hardware (manufactured by HTC most likely) for what you'd pay Samsung for a Galaxy S7? Jokes about exploding Galaxy Note 7s aside, my guess is that most tech buyers will pause. Android 7.0 Nougat screenshots SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 5 NEXT PREV These tech buyers may also look to Lenovo's Moto unit for a better deal. After all, the Pixel will have solid specs--12MP rear camera, 32GB storage, 2.0GHz 64-bit processor--but the win is the latest updates from Google. Still -- given Android's maturity -- getting the latest updates from Google isn't the big incentive it used to be. In addition, I've had a few Nexus devices and while the updates on Android are notable there's a beta feel to the whole experience. I'm not sure Google is going to be able to command a premium price for devices that are largely going to be on par with what's produced already by Lenovo. Add it up and Google/Android win on machine learning, AI, maps and being helpful as it walks a line of knowing too much about you. Google is a software and information brand. I probably won't care what hardware Google runs on and certainly won't pay up for an integrated all-Google experience I can get with another Android device. Now all of that can change should Google integrate the experience well. Judging from the Nexus experience historically, Google has some work to do.

Rohit KVN   October 3, 2016 19:00 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares Google Pixel final round-up: Expected features, release and price detailsGoogle (Official) site We are just a few hours away from Google's product launch event. It is scheduled to kick off at 9:00 am PDT (21:30 IST) on October 4 in Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco. Unlike the previous years, 2016 is touted to be a game changer for the search engine giant, as the company, for the first time, will officially brand the new phones with Google moniker and ditch the Nexus line. Why advertise with us? Related Google October 4 event: New development on Pixel and Pixel XL is sure to excite loyalists Android 7.0 Nougat update schedule for Nexus 6, 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9, Pixel C, Nexus Player, Android One It has come to light that despite HTC being the manufacturer, it will not find any space for company's name on them, instead the products are said to come with Google Pixel and Pixel XL names. We have leafed through many reliable reports and come up with a list of probable features, which are likely to make the cut in the upcoming Google Pixel series phones. Design and Display: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL versions internally known as HTC Sailfish and Marlin, respectively, will look identical. They are said to flaunt full-metal uni-body design language, but differ in screen sizes—one, with 5.0-inch having full HD (1920x108p) resolution and another with 5.5-inch display having QHD (2560x1440p) resolution. Google Pixel: 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.6 mm and weigh 143g Google Pixel: 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6 mm and weigh 168g Both the devices' screen is said to be based on energy efficient AMOLED and come with IP53 rating. What's protected under IP53 ratings? In IP53 certification, the numerical '5' suggests that the upcoming Google Pixel series devices cannot withstand certain dust particles from entering inside the device, but it will assure that it won't affect phone's operation. On the other hand, numerical '3' indicates that if water is sprayed at an angle up to 60-degree from the up, it will have no harmful effect on the phone. To sum it up, Google Pixel series owners can answer call during rain, but cannot take it for a dip in the swimming pool.

It will be backed by Adreno 530 GPU, 4GB RAM and 32GB/128GB internal storage. Another key improvement in this department is that Google has incorporated microSD slot with expansion up to 256GB storage, which was sorely missed in all the previous Nexus series phones. Mobile Operating System: As per latest reports, Google's new Pixel and Pixel XL will come with the new Android v7.1 Nougat out-of-the-box. They will also come pre-loaded with Google Duo video chatting app and the Allo messaging app with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Google Assitant. Camera: Like SoC (System-on-Chip) hardware, Google Pixel and XL will have same camera module. Both are said to feature 12MP camera with 1.55um pixel lens, f/2.0 aperture, OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation) on the back and an 8MP snapper on the front. Price: As per numerous reports, Google Pixel and Pixel XL's prices are expected to start at $450 (approx. €404/RS. 30,195) and 600 (roughly €538/Rs. 40,260), respectively. Release: Going by the previous release patterns, Google Pixel series is expected to be made available for purchase on the launch day in select markets via Play store and eventually release it in third-party retail stores in other regions. Rumours are rife that Google might also launch new tablets and convertible notebooks powered by the new Andromeda OS. Watch this space for more updates.

However following the debacle that was the app’s launch, Google had nothing to fear as Apple’s CEO Tim Cook had at that time recommended Google Maps as an alternative while they sorted their problems out. That was a few years ago and Apple Maps has come a long way since. If you’re still looking for reasons to use the app, you might be interested to learn that Apple has since updated the Maps app with full Amtrak support. What this means is that in addition to support for the northeast routes, Apple Maps will now support pretty much the entire Amtrak system that covers the Midwest, Northwest, South, and West regions of the US. It will also cover Canadian cities of Montréal and Vancouver, so if you are a Canadian resident you can look forward to taking advantage of this update as well. Now we’re not sure if this change will be enough to bring users back into the fold, but if you’ve always favored native apps then we guess the support for Amtrak is Apple getting one step closer to creating the Maps app that iOS users deserve.

It's also the only Echo product you can connect to an existing audio setup. The Bad Amazon's Echo products still can't offer audio that syncs across multiple devices in multiple rooms. The Bottom Line The new and improved Echo Dot takes Amazon's best-in-class smart home speaker and wraps it in an ultra-affordable package. 9.5 Overall Features 10.0 Usability 9.0 Design 9.0 Performance 10.0 CNET Editors' Choice Oct '16 Review Sections Review Prices Specifications User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Appliances Smart Home Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Apple is rumored to be working on a Siri-powered smart home speaker with built-in cameras. The Google Home smart speaker could go on sale as soon as tomorrow, October 4. Alexa finally has some competition. That's almost certainly why we have a second-gen Amazon Echo Dot. With the price slashed to a near-absurd $50 (or £50 in the UK, where Alexa launched just last month), Amazon's goal is obvious -- get its virtual voice assistant into as many homes as possible now, before people have other options. That means that the Dot is designed to sell, sell, sell. And to step all over the arrival of Google Home. Not that it needed much help. The original Echo Dot, launched just last March as a pint-sized follow-up to the surprise smash-hit Amazon Echo smart speaker, was by all accounts just as successful as its predecessor. It sold out quicker than even Amazon had anticipated and won rave reviews, including an Editors' Choice distinction here on CNET. Now, after being out of stock for months, the Dot is back, and more affordable than ever. (It isn't available in Australia, but were you to import one the price converts to about AU$65.) It's just as smart as before, too, with all of the same Alexa tricks along with plenty of new ones thanks to a rapidly growing library of third-party voice app "skills." And, despite the lower cost, it's an even better performer than the first generation, with microphones that do a better job of hearing your voice commands over music playback or background noise. In other words, the already-great Echo Dot got a compromise-free price cut. It was an Editors' Choice-winner back in March -- now, it's close to a must-buy for just about anyone who's reading this. The Amazon Echo Dot is back (and even better... See full gallery 1 - 5 of 13 Next Prev Alexa in a nutshell Enlarge Image The Echo Dot is always listening for its wake word, "Alexa." Say it, and the Dot will light up and listen to your question or command. Tyler Lizenby/CNET "Alexa" is Amazon's cloud-connected, voice-activated virtual assistant. She's Siri in a speaker. You wake her up by saying her name, or by saying one of your two other wake word options, "Amazon" or "Echo." The array of microphones inside of the Echo Dot is always listening, and when they hear the wake word, they'll record whatever you say next and send it off through the cloud to Amazon's servers. Those servers will figure out what you're asking for, then tell Alexa how to respond. All of this happens in about a second. You can ask Alexa to do all sorts of things. For starters, she can stream music from Amazon Prime Music, Pandora, or Spotify. She can can play podcasts from iHeartRadio or TuneIn. She can set kitchen timers. She can look up facts. She can wake you up in the morning. She can tell your kids painfully bad jokes. She can read off the day's headlines from whatever news sources you like (including, ahem, CNET). All you have to do is ask. On top of that, Alexa keeps getting smarter thanks to an increasingly robust market of third-party voice apps called "skills." There are over 3,000 of them at this point, and each one teaches Alexa a new trick. The Uber and Lyft skills let you tell Alexa to call you a ride. The Capital One skill lets you tell Alexa to make a credit card payment. The Domino's skill lets you tell Alexa to order a pizza. A skill called The Wayne Investigation lets you talk your way through an interactive mystery set in Gotham City. You can browse through them all in the Alexa app, then pick which ones you want to enable. You can also just ask Alexa to turn one on by saying something like, "Alexa, enable the Jeopardy skill." And, as of now, none of them cost anything. Alexa can control a growing list of smart home gadgets, too, including connected lighting setups, smart thermostats, and popular smart home platforms. Ask her to turn the kitchen lights off or raise the temperature a few degrees, and she'll happily comply. Here are some of the most popular options: Philips Hue connected LEDs LIFX connected LEDs Ledvance Lightify connected LEDs Lutron connected lighting setups Haiku smart lights and ceiling fans Belkin WeMo Switches August Smart Lock Scout Home Security system Ecobee3 Smart Thermostat Nest Learning Thermostat SmartThings connected home platform Wink connected home platform Insteon connected home platform GE smart appliances Garageio garage door opener Logitech Harmony Hub entertainment controller Control4 smart home setups Nexia smart home setups Crestron smart home setups We've been using Alexa to control gadgets like these in the CNET Smart Home for over a year now, and she's terrific at it. If you have any interest in smart home tech whatsoever, then the Echo Dot is an absolute no-brainer. Small, but mighty Enlarge Image The new Echo Dot is a little smaller than the original, with two new volume buttons replacing the volume ring. It's now also available in white. Tyler Lizenby/CNET The new Echo Dot is a little shorter than the original because there's no longer a ring around the top that you turn to control the volume. Instead, you turn things up and down using two new volume buttons on the top of the device. It's also a bit lighter, with a glossy plastic casing instead of the matte black body of generation one. And, of course, it's available in white now (which looks quite good, in my opinion). Other than that, this is the same Dot as before: same plug-and-play simplicity, same voice-activated smarts. Like every other Echo product, the Dot is really just an access point for the Amazon Alexa cloud platform. That means that you're getting the exact same Alexa features as you would with the full-size Amazon Echo or the battery-powered Amazon Tap. The Dot just has a less powerful speaker. There's an ace up the Dot's sleeve, though, and that's the fact that you can connect it with existing speakers and audio setups over Bluetooth or via line-in cable. Do so, and you'll essentially make an Echo out of whatever speakers you like. The Echo and Tap can't do that -- with both, it's the built-in speakers or it's nothing. Enlarge Image You can connect the Echo Dot with your existing audio setup using Bluetooth or a line in cable (not included). Tyler Lizenby/CNET That makes Dot the most flexible of the three, and the most intriguing, too. After all, music is a big part of the Alexa experience, and most music lovers already have an audio setup they're happy with. The Dot lets them give that audio setup a brand new brain. Just one, small quibble: Amazon doesn't include a line-in cable with the new Echo Dot like it did with the first one. You'll need to spend five or six bucks on your own (or dig one out of your junk drawer). It's a clear sign that Amazon was trying to get the entry cost as low as possible, and a forgivable omission given that you can still connect with external speakers right out of the box using Bluetooth. Still, I'd like it better if the cable came included.

The iPhone 7 is already here and this week Google are launching their new device into the world. The official announcement is set for tomorrow but thanks to some leaks from Carphone Warehouse, we already know a fair few details about the new phone. What time does the Google event start on October 4? Th event is taking place on October 4 (Photo: Google) The Pixel phone event is on October 4. It will take place in San Francisco and starts at 9am Pacific Standard Time which is 5pm UK time. What is the Google phone called? The tech powerhouse’s newest phone models are called the Pixel and the Pixel XL. Google Pixel specs and features Pictures of the Google Pixel were accidentally leaked by Carphone Warehouse (Photo: Google) Read More iPhone 7 review Well if the Carphone Warehouse leak is to be believed the Pixel has a five-inch screen while the larger Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch display. The OS the phone runs will have a new AI assistant called Allo. Owners of the Pixel will also have free unlimited storage on Google Photos. Engadget reports that the phone will have rapid charging through its USB-C port. The Verge lists the phone as having either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage. There are rumours the phone will come in black, white, silver and electric blue. What else have Google done? Well, obviously Google is the biggest search engine in the world. But beyond that they are the company behind Chromebook computers, the current Nexus phones, the Chrome browser and much more. How is the Google Pixel? According to Android Police, the normal model will cost $649 (£498) for the smaller 32GB device with prices getting gradually higher from there. So it’s certainly not a cheap option. poll loading Will you be buying the Google Pixel? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO What will happen at the event? At this rate Google could just be telling us things we already know so hopefully the Pixel and the Pixel XL will have a super cool USP that hasn’t trickled out onto the internet yet.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Why E-Commerce Needs AMP SEO September 29, 2016 SEO Marc PurtellSeptember 29, 2016 561SHARES 1.3KREADS 561SHARES 1.3KREADS Marc Purtell 561SHARES 1.3KREADS By now, we have all seen or heard something about the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project. Since first being introduced in October 2015, Google has been promoting the benefits of AMP on its blogs. However, it has yet to become widely adopted beyond news websites. On the subject of news sites, AMP is an absolute must-have now that news-related mobile search results featured a carousel exclusively containing AMP pages at the very top (and Google recently announced they will be intermingled within organic search). Since e-commerce sites are different from news sites, a case must be made for the necessity of implementing AMP pages on an e-commerce site (spoiler alert: see the “Why E-commerce Needs AMP” section below). What is AMP The AMP Project is a Google-backed, open-source initiative to speed up the load time of mobile webpages using existing web technologies such as smart caching and predictable performance. This is achieved through a standardized subset of HTML called AMP HTML that helps mobile pages load faster by limiting the use of some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components. The downside to AMP HTML is that with the limited functionality of JavaScript elements, it is not a good fit for interactive content. For static content, however, AMP is a great way to efficiently build much faster-loading pages for mobile. Why E-commerce Needs AMP While e-commerce results do not yet receive the advantage of a featured AMP carousel at the top of a mobile search engine results page the way news sites do, there are other important features of AMP that carry a great deal of benefit. The implementation of AMP pages carries implications for improving user experience and visibility within search results. 40% of consumers will abandon a page that takes more than three seconds to load. That is a huge amount of potential revenue lost. As is the case of many e-commerce platforms, consistently achieving page load times below three seconds is no easy task, especially over a mobile network. Many developers struggle with balancing important elements of a page that help influence conversion with keeping the load time down as much as possible. If you find yourself struggling to keep mobile pages loading under three seconds, AMP could very well be the right solution. Beyond losing potential customers who won’t wait for your page to load, having slow pages will also negatively impact the ability of consumers to even find your products. There are two main factors limiting the visibility of slow pages within search results: Search engine ranking algorithms (especially Google’s) favors faster pages, therefore slow load time hinders your site’s rankings. High response time severely limits the number of URLs Google will crawl from a website, meaning that some of your pages may not even be indexed. Now that Google is officially rolling out AMP pages in organic search results, implementing AMP addresses both of these issues. Early adopters of AMP in the e-commerce space includes eBay. How to Implement Perhaps one of the reasons for the slow adoption of AMP, especially in the realm of e-commerce, is the fear of an over-complicated implementation process. Humans tend to fear change. This was certainly the case for me when I first started learning about AMP last year. As it turns out, AMP implementation is relatively simple and there are many resources available to assist with the process. The AMP Project hosts a step-by-step guide that coaches you through building your first AMP page. If someone without a development background and as technically inept as myself can follow the guide, it is most certainly not an overwhelming process. In addition to the guide, there is a wealth of resources including AMP HTML source code, samples, and documentation hosted by GitHub to assist with implementation and troubleshooting. The challenge with manually creating AMP pages is that at scale, this can obviously become a huge undertaking. Larger e-commerce sites require a more automated process to handle the AMP creation. This is why a number of CMS plugins have been developed for creating AMP pages and are available for many e-commerce platforms, such as Magento. Quality Assurance As with anything on the web, you can’t simply set it and forget it. Ensuring AMP pages function properly requires testing and refinement. Once an AMP page is up and running, it is important to complete a heuristic evaluation to ensure that important elements of the page are not missing. In addition to quality assurance of the user experience, be sure to cover any potential duplicate content issues by verifying proper tagging. Most importantly, confirm that the AMP page contains a rel=canonical tag that references the standard (i.e. HTML) version of the page. For those of you that have already launched AMP pages, whether for e-commerce or other types of sites, please share your experiences in the comments. We would love to hear about any pain points of implementation, changes in performance, or issues you overcame.   Image Credits Featured Image: geralt/Pixabay.com Screenshot by Marc Purtell.

There’s plenty of competition in the $400 range, with the Moto Z Play Droid occupying a special niche with its innovative design. It’s definitely not “another boring smartphone.” The modular smartphone is a great idea. It just makes sense, considering the smartphone is such a diverse and ubiquitous gadget. Smartphones already double as PDAs, GPS units, cameras, and even wallets; so why not a stereo, TV/projector, and more? Moto Z Play Droid Early attempts at modular smartphones have fallen flat. The semi-modular LG G5 proved a poor implementation with limited expansion accessories, while Google’s Project Ara, with its aim at reducing e-waste, was scrapped before launch. The new Motorola Moto Z line of modular phones, including the mid-range Moto Z Play Droid, offer something similar to the LG G5, just with a better execution. The Moto Z smartphones expand through Moto Mods that attach magnetically to the back panel. The process of swapping Mods is literally a snap, and unlike the G5, doesn’t require the Android handset power down. It’s unique and it’s different. But the market doesn’t reward innovation for innovation’s sake. Is it any good? That’s all that matters. Read on to find out. Build & Design The Motorola Moto Z Play Droid is one of four Moto Z smartphones, including the unlocked (GSM) Moto Z, and the Verizon exclusives, Moto Z Force Droid and Moto Z Droid. The Moto Z Play Droid is also Verizon exclusive (the Droid branding gives it away), and it has the most modest specs and lowest price of the bunch. Moto Z Play Droid Silver Oak Style Shell The Moto Z Play Droid looks like your average mid-range smartphone, measuring 6.2 x 3 x 0.3 inches, and weighing 5.6 ounces, sans a Style Shell back panel. And that’s where the Moto Z line distinguishes itself. The attached back panels serve as a base plate for modular expansion. Exposed, it features a round camera bulge, Motorola branding, and a dedicated accessory port/connector. It’s magnetic, enabling Moto Mods to adhere securely and stick. The Moto Z Play Droid ships with a removable Style Shell, giving the smartphone a more traditional back panel. Our review unit came with the silver oak wooden shell, and the lineup includes nylon and leather options. Other Moto Mods include a JBL SoundBoost Speaker, Moto Insta-Share Projector, Incipio offGRID Power Pack, and Hasselblad True Zoom camera. Together with a Style Shell, the Moto Z Play Droid measures .37 inches thick, and weighs 6.8 ounces. That’s larger than most other 2016 smartphones in any price class, but not bulky by any reasonable standard. The Moto Z Play Droid is no less pocketable than a slick iPhone 7 Plus or Galaxy Note 7. Moto Z Play Droid camera bump The Style Shell and other Moto Mods come off and on easily, and again, stay on securely. Our Style Shell never slipped or accidentally came off during testing. The wood backing also felt very pleasant to the touch, and we’re confident the leather and nylon alternatives would as well, given Motorola’s design history. We worry that the contacts on the back panel could suffer corrosion over time, especially moisture or grit gets stuck under the case. They showed no signs of that during our brief time with it, however. Otherwise, the Moto Z Play Droid looks like a standard smartphone, with a flat display panel and rounded corners. There’s a large display bezel on the top and bottom, housing the earpiece, speaker, flash, 5-megapixel front camera, and sensors (top), as well as a pinhole mic and square fingerprint sensor (bottom). Moto Z Play Droid fingerprint sensor Moto Z Play Droid contacts The fingerprint sensor presents an annoying issue.  By default, it unlocks the phone, and also puts it to sleep. Because it resembles a home button, sits right below the on-screen nav icons, and is very sensitive, accidental presses are way too common. An aluminum alloy bumper wraps the edges, holding the textured power button and two-button volume control on the right side, which are easy to distinguish via touch. The SIM/microSD tray sits on the top half, next to another mic, while the bottom houses the headphone jack and USB Type-C input. Moto Z Play Droid SIM tray Moto Z Play Droid USB Type-C and headphone jack While much was made of Apple ditching the headphone jack for the iPhone 7, Moto was the first, with the Moto Z, Moto Z Droid, and Moto Z Force Droid shipping without it. That resulted in some slick handsets, but we’ll take a slightly bulkier smartphone with a full complement of ports any day. Moto Z Play Droid buttons Moto Z Play Droid side Again, it’s a bit larger than most handset with similar screen sizes, though not overly cumbersome. In hand, the Moto Z Play feels great. It’s solid, and its weight lends itself to a quality build. Of course, we recommend a case, even it makes switching Moto Mods more difficult. Motorola claims the Moto Z Play Droid has a “water repellent nano-coating,” which should protect the Android smartphone against spills, splashes, and light rain. Don’t submerge it though, because it’s not waterproof. Display & Speaker The Moto Z Play Droid has a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. That results in a cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio and 403 pixels per inch. Android flagships, including the other Moto Zs, top out at 500+ PPI, which is borderline overkill. While you can spot a difference in sharpness in a side-by-side comparison, it’s a difference between “great” and “even better.” That is to say the Moto Z Play Droid has a stunning display. The Super AMOLED technology gives it a deep contrast and vibrant colors, with a slight magenta tone. Set to max, it’s bright enough to cut through outdoor glare. It lacks color calibration features beyond two settings, standard and vibrant. We wish Motorola packed in more, and maybe even some sort of comfort or night mode that filters out blue tones for yellow. The Moto Z Play Droid outputs decent sound, for a smartphone. It’s loud enough and clear for personal use, and extremely clean compared against other smartphones with no distortion at either end. But as we always state in this section, smartphone speakers are the last thing you should consider before buying a device. Moto Mods Unquestionably, the Moto Mods have potential; and Motorola executed on a great idea with its first-generation semi-modular smartphone. Moto Z buyers will still need to place some faith in Motorola that it’s committed to producing and promoting the accessories. Moto Z Play Droid with Style Shell For its part, Motorola offers a Moto Mods development kit, and promises “Moto Mods developed today are designed to work with future-generation Moto Z phones.” Does that also mean Moto Mods released in the future will be backward compatible with first-generation Moto Zs? Because that would be a great reason to buy a Moto Z Play. Beyond the speaker, camera, projector, and battery, we hope to see future Moto Mods embrace more niche interests, including business (a portable point-of-sale terminal) and gaming (a cabinet with controller). We’d also love to see wacky cases with e-ink displays, thermal camera rigs, and home health monitors. Performance This is a midrange smartphone, with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor (2 GHz) and 3GB RAM. Today’s flagships, including other Moto Zs, have Snapdragon 820 processors along with 4GB RAM. Expect 6GB RAM and the Snapdragon 821 to become the high-end norm with the next crop of smartphones (Xiaomi just announced the Mi 5s Plus with those internals). Still, it’s enough to keep the Moto Z Play Droid humming along. It runs near stock Android very well. It’s stable and swift, and fine for day-to-day use. It even handles demanding 3D games, like Modern Combat 5, with ease. Turning to the benchmarks, the Motorola Moto Z Play Droid scored 799 on the Geekbench 4 single-core test, 2599 on the multi-core test, and 2473 on the Compute (graphics) test. For some perspective, the flagship-level Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (with a Snapdragon 820 and 4GB RAM) scored 1687, 3945, and 6185 on the same tests, respectively. It’s also worth noting the Moto Z Play’s fingerprint sensor is very good. It’s quick and accurate, and did not require a second press once during testing. Battery Wow! We have a new battery champion! The Moto Z Play Droid has by far the best battery we’ve ever tested on a smartphone. It’s a 3510mAh whopper that lasted 22 hours and 52 minutes streaming video over Wi-Fi with the screen brightness set to max. Anything over 8 hours is good. Twelve hours in the gold standard. The Moto Z Play Droid is otherworldly. Keep in mind, 22 hours and 52 minutes is about the minimum you can expect from this smartphone. With regular use, you could easily go three or four days between charges. It also charges fast thanks to USB Type-C. It went from dead to 42% in just 30 minutes with the bundled charger. Next to Moto Mods, the battery is the primary reason to buy the Moto Z Play Droid. Software The Moto Z Play Droid runs near stock Android The Moto Z Play Droid ships with Android 6.0.1, and is pretty much guaranteed to receive the Android Nougat update sometime in Q4, according to Motorola. After Nougat, it’s much less of a sure thing. Lenovo, which now owns Motorola, has a poor initial record with updates. It abandoned the 2014 Moto X flagship by not supplying an Android Marshmallow update, and updates have been very slow coming to Verizon-exclusive Droids, like the Droid Turbo 2 and Droid MAXX 2. This includes security updates. Lenovo and Motorola have never committed to monthly security updates, and Motorola claims it will “bundle security updates in a scheduled Maintenance Release (MR) or OS upgrade.” Our review unit shipped with the July security update, and updated to the September patch by September 28. Our Huawei Honor 8 received similarly-scheduled updates, while our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge received the July, August, and September updates, all early in each month. It’s not all bad news, though. The Moto Z Play Droid has near stock Android, with Moto’s excellent voice and action commands, and it’s very clean. Verizon wisely ditched the harsh black-and-red Droid branding in favor of Android’s pleasing Material Design. We loved the fact that the homescreens respond to landscape orientation (Samsung TouchWiz phones do not), but wish it included a “restart” option instead just “power off.” The Moto Z Play Droid is only available with 32GB capacity (microSD expandable). Of that, about 24GB is available out of the box, with Android taking up 8.15GB, and apps taking up about 4GB. Verizon bloatware Being a Verizon smartphone, there’s plenty of bloatware. Some games, like Cake Jam, Farm Heroes, and Panda Pop can be deleted, while other Verizon mainstays like NFL Mobile, IMDB, and Slacker Radio cannot. The stock internet browser and gallery apps have been replaced by Chrome and Google Photos, respectively, still redundant apps remain an issue, with Verizon causing the most problems. So the Moto Z Play Droid has both Verizon Cloud and Google Drive, as well Hangouts, Google Messenger, and the useless Verizon Message + app, in addition to Google Maps and Verizon Navigator. Camera The Moto Z Play Droid has a 16-megapixel rear camera with an f/2 aperture and 1.3um pixel size, and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with an f/2.2 aperture and wide-angle lens (85 degrees). Flagships smartphones have wider apertures and larger pixels, mostly for better low-light results, but the Play Droid’s specs are in line with other mid-range smartphones. Thanks to quick launch actions, you can start snapping pictures from a sleeping Moto Z Play Droid within seconds, and its laser and phase detection focus is reasonably fast (though we ran into problems touch focusing in some macro shooting situations). The default app is clean and intuitive, with a swipe based navigation, and a pro mode for tweaking the ISO, white balance, shutter speed, and more. Other features are typical for smartphone cameras, including touch focus, panorama, and a best shot mode. The front-facing selfie camera has a dedicated flash and beauty mode, which results scary selfies when manually set to max. Video is limited to 1080p at 30fps, with a slow motion option. There’s no 4K, which isn’t so bad. 4K smartphone video is way overkill. Sample Photos Everything looks pleasant, especially the colors, which pop with appropriate saturation. Details are crisp, with proper exposure levels, as evident by the visible details in the Riverside sign’s black and white paint areas. The white balance also does it job, adjusting appropriately in tough lighting, as seen in the stairwell pic. The Moto Z Play Droid struggles in low light, however. This is true of all mid-range smartphones, and even some flagships. Look at the Moto Z Play Droid’s sleeping dog picture against the same photo taken by the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. The current-generation Samsung smartphones are the absolute best at low-light photo output, and no smartphone outside of the iPhone 7 even comes close. Moto Z Play Droid low-light photo Samsung Galaxy S7 edge low-light photo Value The Moto Z Play Droid costs $408, which is the current sweet spot for price to performance. The excellent Honor 8, OnePlus 3, and ZTE Axon cost about the same. The Moto Z Play is less powerful than those three devices, but its battery is far superior. And it has Moto Mods. The Moto Z costs $700, while the Z Droid costs $624 and the Moto Z Force Droid costs $720. A GSM unlocked Moto Z Play is launching soon for $450. All Moto Zs have a 5.5-inch display. The upmarket devices have more pixels, with a 535 PPI. They also have a Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB RAM, with a 64GB capacity option. The Moto Z and Z Droid are thinner and lighter, and have a smaller battery, 13-megapixel camera, and no headphone jack. The Moto Z Force Droid is only slightly lighter, with no headphone jack, a similarly-sized battery, 21-megapixel camera, and an amazing ShatterShield display. Of the three, we gravitate toward the Moto Z Force Droid. It’s powerful and Moto ShatterShield is one of our favorite smartphone features. It has a killer battery, too. Conclusion Motorola gives us hope the modular smartphone can work. It smartly implemented the feature with the Moto Z lineup, and then combined it with a world-class battery to make the Moto Z Play Droid a compelling smartphone. There’s plenty of competition in the $400 range, with the Moto Z Play Droid occupying a special niche with its innovative design. It’s definitely not “another boring smartphone.” It’s not a perfect smartphone either. Motorola’s software update issues, particularly with the Droid lineup worries us, and we’re a bit concerned about those Moto Mod contacts. How well will they hold up over time? Also, Motorola needs to move the fingerprint sensor where it’s impossible to confuse for a home button. But none of these issues disqualify the Moto Z Play Droid from consideration. This is a good device with an exciting design, decent camera, and the best battery we’ve ever tested. Give it a close look if you’re in the market. Pros Innovative design with Moto Mods The best battery we’ve ever tested Decent performance and camera output Near stock Android Cons Too much carrier bloatware Fingerprint sensor easily confused for home button LEAVE A COMMENT 0 Comments | Log in to comment All content posted on TechnologyGuide is granted to TechnologyGuide with electronic publishing rights in perpetuity, as all content posted on this site becomes a part of the community.

By Danny Palmer | October 3, 2016 -- 13:13 GMT (06:13 PDT) | Topic: Security Unwitting victims may have given Dresscode access to their enterprise networks... Image: iStock More than 400 apps available via the official Google Play Store contain the Dresscode Trojan malware, according to researchers. The Dresscode malware first appeared in April: once downloaded by an unwary user, Dresscode can be used by those controlling it to conduct cyberespionage, download sensitive data, or recruit other devices on the network into a botnet. Cybersecurity researchers at Trend Micro have warned that over 400 instances of Dresscode malware are available for download from the Google Play store where, using a similar technique to the Viking Horde malware, it masquerades as a legitimate application to trick the user into downloading it. Android Trojan malware makes hackers $500,000 The irremovable Hummer is now the number one Trojan in the world, with over one million current victims. Read More Dresscode apps disguised as games, skins, themes, and phone optimization boosters have all been spotted in the store: the Trojan is only a small part of the app, making it much harder to spot. According to Google Play's own download statistics, one particular malicious app -- a Grand Theft Auto related modification for Minecraft -- has been installed between 100,000 and 500,000 times, meaning this app alone could've infected almost a half a million users with Dresscode. It's just one of hundreds on the Google Play store and at least 3,000 more instances available to download via other Android app markets. Once a malicious app carrying Dresscode is installed, it will communicate with a command and control server which is able to issue commands, including the instruction to infiltrate the network the infected device is connected to, an act which can put a whole enterprise network at risk. The rise of bring-your-own-device and employees connecting their smartphones to enterprise networks means those behind Dresscode have an ever-growing inventory of potential targets. While the malware isn't targeted at a specific individual like a sophisticated phishing scheme, the sheer number of infected apps downloaded means cybercriminals are likely to locate a wide variety of lucrative targets to potentially steal data from. In addition to enabling the theft of data, devices infected with Dresscode can end up part of a botnet for the use of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or spam email campaigns. The botnet is also capable of using proxied IP addresses generated by the malware to create fake traffic for ad clicks to generate money for the attackers -- a tactic which could cost the victim money. Researchers also warn that Dresscode is also a threat to home networks, especially if the infected device is able to connect to a home router with an easily crackable password. Attackers could gain control of every device in the home this way. Ultimately, the one way users can avoid becoming infected with Dresscode is to be mindful of what they're downloading - especially if it's not from an official Android app outlet. A little research into the reviews could be all it takes to determine whether an app is malicious or not. When asked for comment on the situation, a Google spokesperson told ZDNet "We're aware of the issue and we've taken the necessary actions."

View Liveblog 2016-10-04T11:00:00-05:00 It's almost time for what promises to be one of the biggest Google announcements of the year. On Oct. 4 at 9:00 am Pacific/Noon eastern/5:00 pm UK, Google will launch its newest line of smartphones and maybe a whole bunch of other hardware products. We'll be live in San Francisco bringing you the latest news from the event. If you're wondering what to expect, we've got a rundown of all the rumors here. If everything plausible comes true, we'll be looking at five devices: Pixel Phones, Google Home, Google Wi-Fi, Daydream VR, and a 4K Chromecast. Regardless of how many of these come true, the announcement will be the coming out party for the new Google Hardware division. Earlier this year, former Motorola President Rick Osterloh was tasked with revamping Google's hardware strategy into a cohesive offering, and we should see the start of that initiative at this event.

 Amazon is winning the race to the future Steve Kovach Oct. 3, 2016, 9:00 AM 10,256 facebook linkedin twitter email print Skye Gould/Business Insider This is the week when artificially intelligent assistants start getting serious. On Tuesday, Google is expected to announce the final details for Home, its connected speaker with the new Google Assistant built inside. But first Amazon, which surprised everyone last year by practically inventing the AI-in-a-can platform, will release a new version of the Echo Dot, a cheaper and smaller model of the full-sized Echo that promises to put the company's Alexa assistant in every room in your house. The Echo Dot has all the capabilities of the original Echo, but at a much cheaper price, and with a compact form factor that's designed to be tucked away. Because of its size (it looks like a hockey puck from the future), its sound quality isn't as good as the Echo, but it can hook up to an external speaker through a standard audio cable or Bluetooth. And at $49.99, the Echo Dot makes an enticing introduction to the new digital assistant in your home category, and a way for current Echo owners to extend its capabilities throughout the house. You can also buy a six-pack (buy five, get one free) or 12-pack (buy 10, get two free) of Echo Dots if you want to go all out and have Alexa helping you out everywhere in your home. The Dot ships on October 20, and is available for the first time to everyone, not just Amazon Prime members. You can pre-order it now. How it works I've tested the regular Echo before, but this was my first time trying the Dot since the first model launched this spring. This new version has better microphones than its predecessor, but other than that and the slashed price (down from $90), not much else has changed. I connected the Dot to an external speaker with an auxiliary cable, but you're still free to use the built-in speaker if you want. It's fine for listening to responses from Alexa, but music sounds terrible. The Dot wasn't designed as an audio device. Instead, it's a cheap way to extend Alexa to all corners of your home.  I live in a tiny, one bedroom New York City apartment, so I didn't really get to test a full network of Dots throughout my place. But I can imagine keeping a Dot in the bedroom and other rooms in the house and the full-sized Echo in the living room or other common area for music. The real magic is having Alexa with you no matter where you are. Plus, if you have a nice stereo system that you still love, the Dot makes a great way to add some smarts to it without spending a fortune on new equipment. I connected the Echo Dot to an external JBL speaker. Steve Kovach/Business Insider In addition to music, Alexa can do all the things you'd expect from a digital assistant by now like checking your calendar appointments, weather, sports scores, etc. The Echo Dot also doubles as a hub for a range of smart appliances including thermostats, power outlets, and lights. So if you want to trick out your home with automated gear, you can control it all with your voice with the Dot. The real strength though is the library of third-party services. Most digital assistants put tight restrictions on what developers can do with their systems, but Alexa is open to just about anyone. You can do everything from hailing an Uber to ordering a Domino's pizza to checking your Capital One balance through Alexa, and the list of capabilities continue to grow each week. No other digital assistant can offer that. Alexa is accurate and fast too. There's almost no lag between when you make a request and you get what you want, unlike Siri. I found it can still handle most queries just as well as any competitor, although not always when it comes to basic queries. Google still has the advantage there. It also helps that the directional microphones in the Dot are extremely accurate, even when music is playing or you're across the room. I was able to control the Dot perfectly while standing several feet away and even down the hall and around the corner from my living room. The Dot's ability to always hear and understand you is just as impressive as anything else it can do. The future of AI in your home The real story here is Amazon is far head of everyone else in the category. That doesn't mean Amazon will ultimately win. Google still has the advantage when it comes to machine learning and AI, and Apple's entry into the category is reportedly in the works. But it does mean Amazon is the first company that can infiltrate every corner of your home with an always-listening digital assistant, and it's the first opportunity to get a taste of the future today. Echo is also the only AI platform with a vibrant, third-party app selection. It's unclear if Google Home will have anything similar at launch and Apple's Siri limits third-party integration to certain categories like messaging and payments. (Plus Siri keeps you tied to the iPhone.) Another advantage: Amazon is extending Alexa to other non-Amazon gadgets, a move that could make it the operating system of choice for any connected speaker. The most significant partnership is coming early next year when Sonos speakers will integrate with the Echo and Echo Dot. It may be early days, but Amazon has built a capable and affordable way for anyone to add a bunch of smarts to their home. The Echo Dot isn't just a great option because it was first. It's a great option because of its nearly flawless execution of the future of AI in the home.
