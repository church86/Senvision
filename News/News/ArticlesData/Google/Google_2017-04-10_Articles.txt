If you own a Nexus 5X device, then you’ve been waiting for the Android 7.1.2 update, which Google has released this week. We have to mention that this update was released more for the Pixel C in terms of new features, but at the same time the Nexus devices also got some feature improvements and bug fixes. The Nexus 5X owners should see the Android 7.1.2 OTA update hitting their devices in the following days, since Google has mentioned that it will start rolling out the new update last Monday. However, if you can’t wait for the OTA update to hit your device, you can always download the factory images from the Google’s factory image website and install it on your device. Aside from the Pixel C and Nexus 5X, this update has also been released for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus Player and Nexus 6P handsets. We have to mention that the Android 7.1.2 update will be the latest software feature upgrade for the Nexus 9 and Nexus 6. The two mentioned handsets have been released back in 2014 and their two year warranty has expired for quite a while. As we’ve mentioned above, the Android 7.1.2 comes with many new feature updates for the Pixel devices, especially for the Pixel C, but at the same time the new update comes with some general improvements and bug fixes for the Nexus 5X. The most important changes include improved notification stability, general connectivity improvements, battery usage alerts and a fingerprint swipe feature update. The new “Battery Usage Alerts” feature is found in the battery settings tab and it will alert you about the applications that are “abusing” the battery of your handset. The Android 7.1.2 Nougat update also comes with the April security update, which fixes some security issues. For a full list of security improvements, you can head to Android security web page.

Exclusive: These could be Google's upcoming Android Wear smartwatches David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/07/11 12:52pm PDTJul 11, 2016 237 Plus 1 on G+ 515 Share on Facebook 354 Share on Twitter Total Shares1106 Android Wear Exclusives News Smartwatches Update 1: 2017/02/15 7:44am PST When we wrote this post way back in July 2016, we actually had the codenames of the watches mixed up - Angelfish is the LG Watch Style. Swordfish is the LG Watch As we reported last week, Google is in the process of building two Android Wear smartwatches. At the time, we were unable to show you the watches themselves. Today, that changes - what you see in the image above could be codename and "Swordfish" and "Angelfish," Google's two Assistant-enabled wearables that we believe will be released after the new Nexus phones. Disclaimer: No matter the confidence level, there's always a chance product updates, features, and some or all details will be changed or cancelled altogether. As with all rumors, nothing is 100% until it's officially announced. We do not have possession of any APKs we can distribute or unreleased devices, so please don't ask for them. Confidence level We give this rumor a confidence level of 7 out of 10. As said in the previous post, we know Google is currently in the process of prototyping these smartwatches, but we don't know exactly when they're going to be released. Because they are not at the near-finished state of development of the Nexus phones, we are subtracting three points. Specifically, because: The very fact that these recreated images are of devices which likely are still undergoing design and technical development means that things could and probably even will change. They could end up looking totally different! It's also possible one or both could be cancelled or delayed. We just can't know. What we know is this is how they were imagined by Google at some point. (Minus two points.) We are unable to share our primary source, and instead have recreated the watches ourselves, which inherently means they may look slightly different than that primary source or final press images once they are released. (Minus one point.) With that considered, let's dive in. The evidence We are unable to share our primary source evidence for the renders we have created. Suffice it to say, we have seen enough to create these images, and believe confidently that they accurately depict the source material we were working with. These are not "interpretations," but recreations of primary source material for the sake of anonymity of our source. So, let's take a closer look. The watch on the left is the larger Swordfish device. As you can see, its large crown button is quite prominent, with the smaller "shoulder" buttons above and below it being much shorter. The watch face appears to be a new iteration of Google's new customizable faces in Android Wear 2.0, with an impressive if possibly overwhelming level of information density. As we stated in our original post, we believe Swordfish's strap and lug design will not allow for use of the Google MODE Android Wear watch bands, as the straps on this watch curve where they meet the bottom of the watch body. Swordfish has a chunkier, sportier design, and while not visible in this image, it is very substantially thicker than the smaller Angelfish on the right. Angelfish has a clean, smooth look to it - with only that slightly odd crown button breaking up its extremely symmetrical and minimalist look. It's thinner, smaller, and lighter than Swordfish, and it will support use of MODE watch bands. Unlike Swordfish, the bezel on Angelfish has a gentle curve to it. Not pictured here is the fact that Angelfish's display glass also contains a small amount of circular display bezel, so there will be a black "gap" between where the watch body ends and the visible display area begins. My speculation is that this is how Google is avoiding the flat tire on Angelfish - instead of having a single spot "cut" out of the circle, Google just made a smaller circle. This has an obvious downside (smaller display area overall), but it would be a clever solution to the aesthetic issue of the flat tire. We wouldn't really know, probably, until the watch is seen in a live sort of context. We have no information regarding how the watches will be branded (Nexus, Pixel, Google?), what they will cost, or precisely when they will launch. As a refresher: Swordfish will be the "full-on" standalone smartwatch, owing to its LTE connectivity, GPS, and heart rate sensor. It will be the do-all device that will allow Google to demonstrate Wear's most robust capabilities, including the announcement at Google I/O that Android Wear 2.0 will support standalone apps. Angelfish won't have LTE or GPS (and quite possibly not even a heart rate sensor), and will have a smaller display and overall size. It is clearly meant to target a lower price point, though how low, as I said, we really don't know. Final words What do you think of the design of these smartwatches? Love them? Hate them? Can't really tell? I admit, having a single angle to work with when evaluating a watch is difficult, and we agonized over the best way to show you these devices in a way we felt would be faithful to the primary source evidence we worked with. As such, a straight-on shot seemed the least likely to engender confusion or create issues with proportions (thickness, curvature). It's not perfect, but it's what we can give you for now. The watches do, to my eye, bear Google's hard-to-pin-down but still recognizable aesthetic signature. The smooth, simple design of the single-piece watch bodies and the rather subdued faces would pair perfectly with a Nexus phone, wouldn't you say? Of course, as I've said, Google may have substantially updated or even completely nixed these designs in favor of news ones at some point during the development of these devices. That's why we're being a lot more conditional in our language as compared to the Nexus phone design we posted (which we remain confident is very, very close to the devices that will be released). This is more of a glimpse into one point in history - the big question is whether that history will be representative of a future reality. Update 1: 2017/02/15 7:44am PST When we wrote this post way back in July 2016, we actually had the codenames of the watches mixed up - Angelfish is the LG Watch Style. Swordfish is the LG Watch Sport. (We'd had it backwards.) We've corrected this in the post, with this note serving as record of that correction.

Vladimir If you like watches with no design whatsoever. Those look like the template for the watch. I would still buy them if they come with higher resolution display and nice price tag. ctk4949 I dont want watches with a thousand things on them. If that is what you like, oh well. Get those fugly ass super expensive watches. lol Vladimir No. I didn't mean that. If they really look like that, it's like someone used circle tool in photoshop to draw a few curves and filled them with gray color. There is nothing nice about that. TheSpaceUnicorn Watches shouldn't have much design to them at all. They should be nondescript and simple enough as to not grab attention yet elegant enough to match any kind of band you put on it to go with whatever you're wearing, whether it be casual or formal. This is something that, imo, only Motorola has properly been able to pull off thus far. Roger Siegenthaler Well... opinion and more importantly depends on the attire... If you're wearing a non-descript very expensive suit your watch is where you let yourself shine, so no design is bad in that context. Other contexts no design is great, especially with minimal design it always matches. Brad Looks good, but if they're cutting corners - I will have to pass. Heart-rate monitor is one of those have to haves for me. LTE would be nice... but I really want to use Mode bands. I may have to wait it out to see what else comes along. Brad B. During the last podcast, there was some speculation on what "Google Assistant-ready" would mean. I imagine that you'd need a speaker to have 2-way voice interaction with Google Now/Assistant. Could those buttons be volume rockers? Thomas Larsen Seems odd that they would have hardware volume rockers on a watch in my opinion. senor_heisenberg Nexii or not, they're pretty. I want one. Diego Opazo SV-Cross Yeah, i'd buy them! Shagnscooby The smaller one looks like a great successor to my 1st Gen Moto 360. The bigger one just looks clunky, like the LG G Watch R. Aleksey_US The smaller one looks like a great successor to my 2nd Gen (smaller) Moto 360 mattcoz And it's a lot thicker than the GWR. Mayoo I'd take clunky over a flat tire anytime! Victor Souza I used to own a G Watch R and having small wrists I can't say I agree with that, it looked pretty good on me, although I would preffer a smaller size John Samuel αΩ It's hard to say given that there is no banana included in the image for scale. The bigger one could still be smaller than the moto 360 gen 1 and the smaller one could be smaller than a dime. TriguyRN The smaller one is definitely a moto 360 successor. Mark555055 If android pay exists for these, i'm back in the android wear game. Grayson Wait... does the Gear 2 support Samsung Pay? I would be all over that ish... Must look up! Grayson Hmm... apparently the Gear S2 does have NFC, but it seems as though no payment apps are supported yet. Milo Joseph This is a definite buy... Mehedi Hassan take my fucking money Michael M. I think that deign looks a bit boring. Maybe it becomes better with some additional details later. David Stephenson Whew, jumped at that EBay 2nd gen Moto 360 deal earlier...Paypal has an issue processing my payment so I thought, huh, I'll just do it later. Thank you Paypal for making me wait a few minutes for this. Eumelanin Knight You were destined to be together. derp_cookies but not the same! ATTACK Looks as though one could be for a male, and the other for a female. mark Just like men should have big phones, and women should have small phones. And men big laptops, while women have small laptops. ATTACK Really... Come on now... Standard watches come in both men's and women's. So why couldn't these? ATTACK Really... Come on now... Standard watches come in both men's and women's sizes, so why couldn't these. sarxion DROOLS. Steve Freeman Wow, I haven't seen that image and/or meme in ages, thank you for saving it from obscurity. HD Watch me throw money! TypoCorrecto Just have NFC, please. An Angry Chihuahua Out of curiosity, what kind of functionality could NFC have in an smart watch? Like why would you even want that? Victor Souza payments, apparently Ihavenewnike Payments yes. Instead of having to take out phone which is just the same as taking out wallet, you can just use the device which is already out on your wrist. kirko77 Until phones work reliably and accepted in at least ALMOST all locations, it's just a gimmick. I lost count of how many times I've seen people giving up on a phone payment method while holding up the line. Yes, iPhones too Ihavenewnike Samsung pay has done me well in that case. The place doesn't have a NFC terminal but I can still use my phone. Rob Jansen Have you seen the the NFC chip enabled cards at stores? I went to the store and they force you to use your chip reader instead of swiping. Some are faster, but the ones at the grocery store took about 60 seconds... talk about slow kirko77 Those aren't NFC AFAIK. They require direct contact with iCrap my samsung pay works pretty much everywhere. the only place it doesn't work is my local gas station pump kalyan versatile.. james fuston In case you haven't read any other AW posts, the #1 request for NFC is for Android Pay support Smanny I hope they make these new Android Wear watches Daydream VR controllers as well. Nicholas C OMFG YESSSS Jason Efstathiou No please not. They can not be held like the actual controllers, nor do they provide the tactile buttons and touchpad. It would add a significant amount of development complication as well, which the reduction of is the sole purpose of Daydream. Nathan Smith I think they could just be used as motion sensors, to at least track the location of the arm not holding your main controller. The Werewolf First, I'd like to have Android Pay working.. THEN NFC for it on a smartwatch. Android Pay is essentially useless if you're not in the US and maybe the UK. Ironically, Apple Pay does work here in Canada and all the banks are promoting it like crazy. james fuston I'm not debating the usefulness of AP, simply answering the question. bradavon The Sony Smartwatch 3 has NFC but as Android Wear doesn't support Android Pay it doesn't do much. It'll need software support too. blassster It's so obvious. Mobile payments being the biggest, but also contact information exchange, Tasker/IFTTT/etc triggers from NFC stickers, and whatever else you want it to do because Android. Henry Park > whatever else you want it to do because Android Best reason for any feature on an Android for ToasTd Nobody uses those things on phones. Why would they with a watch? Richard Gordon II Some vending machines in the US already accept NFC. Also everywhere in the UK and around Europe use it. You can use it now for the Tube in London over the oyster cards. Gabriel Moraes Funny that you say this. There are many systems that currently use NFC as of now, and could be implemented to a simple software in a phone, but it doesn't because people simply doesn't know that their phone can do it. We have public transport cards, door access cards, credit cards and parking lot cards with NFC, and it all could be centralized in a single secure virtual wallet inside a phone... or a watch. Currently, I only use a credit/debit card on NFC with my phone, but I've successfully managed to copy the information of my uni RFID card to a NFC sticker, and left it inside my wallet. Whenever I forget the card, I just take out my wallet and tap the sensor with it. ToasTd Why are people confusing the possibilities of nfc with actual usage. In the real world it is hardly used. Geeky readers of a tech website dedicated to Android are not representative of the real world and my point is completely valid. Google has never done anything to push nfc. CH1NNV Don't be a dick for the sake of being a dick. Everyone has given plenty of examples. Now just be quiet. morzinbo Source: Ass Henry Park Android's motto isn't "We do it because its useful"..... its "We do it because WE CAN" Roger Siegenthaler Apart from payments... travel tickets (think oyster cards, or swiss pass in switzerland) EDIT: time controlled building entry (think 2FA codes but for building entry... already exist as keyholders) erz2192 In the same vein, hotel room keys Victor Souza the possibilities are limitless *rainbow* TypoCorrecto Mobile payments dhamp2g Pretty stupid question Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Hmmmm it's obvious you're joking. rubixqube So your nfc enabled tesla will auto-open the door for you and auto start. Your nfc connected front door lock will unlock for you. Your personal robot Butler will know your home. When you walk into a store you'll get pummeled with advertisements.. personalized just for you. You can tap your wrist against your nfc enabled juke box like the Fonz to start playing round the clock rock. You can play an NFC enabled game of bloody knuckles with your favorite Uncle where the phone knows who reallyy won. Oh yeah.. and mobile payments. Robpol86 As others have said Android Pay, but for me I'm also hoping that San Francisco's public transportation takes advantage of it so I can board buses/subways/ferries with my watch instead of having to pull out my wallet (their existing contactless cards are based on NFC so the hardware is already there). Honest abe Why beg boycott the change one watch had both features now there taking the technology away and Separating it Into watches To make more profit who can't see that. Shellyman 16K I hope it comes with Google colors wrist bands! :D blindexecutioner I think they look pretty decent if you are into wearing smartwatches. Personally, they have very limited use to me so I'll pass. The one on the left is probably the one I'd go for though. Cassidy James Blaede I really like the look of that smaller one! It's not completely lug-less like my OG Moto 360, but it's close (and looks sleeker). My one question is: ambient light sensor? I love that about my 360 and would be sad to see an official Google watch not have it. mattcoz Yes, an ambient light sensor, that's the one thing I really wish my GWR would have. If these have one I may consider upgrading. Wikiwix I use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.danvelazco.wear.displaybrightness&hl=de for at least two years now, and I wanted to change my watch's brightness manually perhaps 4 times in that time... mattcoz I tried that a long time ago, didn't work at all. Maybe they've fixed it since then. Edit: Nevermind, hasn't been updated in over a year. Lateef Alabi-Oki $99 for the cheaper model, and it'll be a hit. Boolean Corporation Mmh, difficult. I'd imagine something in the order of 199~249 and 349~399 for the bigger one. As cheap. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll buy the cheaper model for $150 tops. If the build quality is good, I'll spend $199 reluctantly. Boolean Corporation Think about it: it can't compete with Pebble at pricerange, so they will try to out-feature them. That is if they're really aiming at a low end consumer. Pebble does all you may primarily need from a smartwatch (notifications, fitness, quick replies... everything) and it would only run you 99USD (Kickstarter price) Sam Lehman That's absurdly cheap, of course it would be a hit! It'll probably be like $250 for the smaller and $350 for the bigger Lateef Alabi-Oki Then it's not going to sell well at those prices. This has to be an impulse purchase. Victor Souza that's more realistic, I'd bet on this pricing tbh, I would love for 99 tho Jam17 I want Angelfish :p Kelly If the swordfish one doesn't look obnoxiously large on a woman's wrist, they will have a winner, been waiting for a more normal sized smart watch for years Suicide_Note They look clean, minimalist, and nice, but still not worth it to me to purchase one. I just don't see the point when I carry my 6P with me everywhere. mattcoz I thought the same thing, then I got one and now I never want to be without it. Suicide_Note For my uses, I just don't see the point, and have no need for this. I'm good with my phones. blassster NFC FOR PAYMENTS OR GTFO TechGuy22 looks like i'm going to replace my OG 360 JSo Well if the final product looks like the renders you guys created, they should be nice watches. Victor Souza I'm only interestend in the swordfish, but no heart-rate sensor really makes me not want either tbh catalysto Agreed. I have no need for LTE, and I could even do without GPS -- especially if it means more battery life. But lack of heart rate monitor is a dealbreaker for me. On the other hand, maybe Angelfish, with a bigger overall battery size, will give longer battery life with LTE and GPS turned off. That would actually be nice... Greg Macek GPS usage on my SW3 only comes into consideration when you use an app that requires it, such as Ghostracer (great running/biking tracking app). Otherwise, it should lay dormant and not kill battery. Though I agree that for now I have no need for LTE. catalysto Good to know, thanks! JMG The SW3 is by far the best Android Wear watch released, can't believe how much use I have gotten out of that watch. If you are a runner and want to keep your phone at home that was and still is the best option...I can track my runs, listen to music and leave the bulky phone behind. Love it. I want Google to release a watch that caters to fitness...music, gps, heart rate (not a deal breaker)...Water proof....LTE would be sweet too...especially if you could use the SIM on Project Fi. I'd buy it immediately. Fit has gotten better ..and each update has made android wear better...even music transfer has gotten quicker. neo905 I have one as well and agree with everything you said. Zsolt V So many nerds are suddenly into fitness. Victor Souza I'm almost 21, been working out since I was 15, got my IG to prove it, so I'm not sure what you mean by "suddenly" also, even if what you say was true to other people, wouldn't that be an amazing thing? What's be wrong with people wanting to work out? Zsolt V "wouldn't that be an amazing thing?" You have a good point there :) Greyhame It'll all depend on the thickness of Angelfish for me. David Ruddock It was published in our previous article. A little over 14mm. Greyhame Yeesh, that's a bit thick. To cram all the goods in, no doubt. But that'll make it a tough sell for me. If those buttons bring some creative functionality and Wear 2.0 can really move the dial (heh), I might take the plunge and grab my first Android Wear watch. Duder12 You guys should mention the bigger of the two will most likely be on Project Fi which means NO MONTHLY DEVICE CHARGE! Woot! Wes C If they allow this on the payment plan, I'll be jumping in on day one no matter the price... Badouken As a Fi subscriber this watch is sounding better and better too me. Mayoo I currently have a Charge HR and while I love it, a full watch could have more use. But for that, I want HR and NFC for Pay (given it finally releases in Canada since they seem to be testing it right now). Without HR and NFC, I think it would just be a nice piece of gadget to own but it wouldn't bring anything new to me. backslashV my wrist is ready! http://i.giphy.com/3oEdv03JAv74J6KGTS.gif supremekizzle Savage MGN87 So is my Johnnson Qbancelli No. My Moto 360 first gen looks WAY BETTER than these. I still get daily compliments on it after 2 years. John Q Too bad you won't get any more updates... mattcoz I still get compliments on my GWR, and I'm sure I would with one of these too. TheSpaceUnicorn It makes no sense for Google to make their own bands and easy swapping mechanism to then make a watch that isn't compatible with them. Aaron Berlin Lack of Mode support may be an engineering necessity, but it's a big disappointment. All I want is one watch I can use to track runs, but dress up for the office. TriguyRN Yep. That's my complaint with the 1st gen 360, in addition to the missing GPS and NFC of course. I can't even use the 2nd gen 360 bands or mode bands with it, so that means running with a metal band or a leather band isn't comfortable but, wearing silicone to dinner isn't classy. YaKillaCJ Sadly the Moto 360 1st Gen with a metal band still holds the title of classiest looking watch. Moto should have left the lugless design and simply fixed the cracking. Gerardo Sarabia I agree. Corey Watford So anyone still want those refurbished Moto 360's? LOL JD More Nexus renders please. Gerardo Sarabia Why ask for renders when we can ask for some photos ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Jason E Perkins I really hope El Goog goes with the Wear 2100 chips for the "Angelfish" device. If what Snapdragon says is true, the watch wouldn't have to be thick to be standalone. If not, I might wait to see what LG has to offer this year. Duder12 You will want to go with whatever works with Project Fi imo since there will be no monthly device charge. DonSerrot We are finally starting to get to something that makes me think about the idea of possibly being ready to maybe consider upgrading from my Gen 1 Moto 360. TriguyRN Right with you there. Are you thinking the bigger one or the smaller? DonSerrot It would largely depend on pricing and features as well as what my finances look like when the time comes. Right now there's too little info to make a choice between the two. Marcelove The render should show 10:10... Pictures of watches "always" ask for watches at that time ;-) Madis Otenurm Beautiful! Blendi Krasniqi I really think google is doing something different this year. HTC is making their two phones but we saw no HTC logo on it, just a Google logo, and now we see these watches from "Google". Which makes me think Google might be releasing the "Google Phone" and the "Google Watch" this year. Maybe even drop the Nexus term since it didn't really went mainstream and the names got confusing. Zsolt V "names got confusing" How so? the closed pistachio Many of the first Android phones said 'with Google' or 'google' on the back. I know the HTC G1 and Samsung Galaxy S did for sure. Funny how things tend to cycle back around F4LL0U7 I'd love the larger one, if only there was a non-LTE option. I don't need it and wouldn't want to pay extra for a watch that has it. NFC / Android Pay would be amazing. Hopefully the standard 22mm bands fit. And hopefully they're affordable. Grayson Same. I'm not paying my carrier 10 fracking dollars per month to use my damn watch, so it's basically just adding cost to the watch for no benefit to myself. If the price is still kept around $250 or less though, it's fine. gilahacker FWIW, Project Fi gives out free data-only SIM cards and there's no extra monthly fee. You just pay for the data the same as you do on a Project Fi phone. Grayson Interesting... youareme7 I didn't know that! Then it might be ok Greg Macek Isn't LTE there only for times when you want to leave your phone behind completely? otherwise it uses Bluetooth with your watch like all other Wear devices. gilahacker I'd certainly hope so, considering the difference in power usage between them. It'd have to be automatic and seamless. I currently have an LG G Watch (original, not R) and it disconnects from my phone if I'm more than one room away. Hopefully the newer better Bluetooth stuff that was recently announced finds its way into this and all upcoming phones. gilahacker +1 for Android Pay. Hope they add it. Quinton If it's not waterproof, I don't want it. I really want to want it, but my Pebble goes swimming with me, and I like that. Manuel Salcedo pebble is really winning this war with the pebble time 2, i mean, its premium AF, Waterproof 30 fukin meters, larger always on color display, heart rate sensor, google MODE straps support.... im sorry google :) Zsolt V Or you could just by a Smartwatch 3 and have almost all of those features, plus Android Wear. z0mer Smartwatch, seriously, nobody will ever care. Steve Freeman Please have the price-point that your tablets (and more or less your phones as well) have had. AKA, better than the competition. Stevie_Wonder This starting to look good, of course I need to see it in real life, but if it has Soli I might be sold. Wander Guzman smartwatch are overrated realjjj 2 things matter most,. Price and availability. If they can't do 99$ or less and achieve global availability, they might as well go back to sleep. neo905 You need to go back to sleep if you expect anything half decent for $99. m477 You want a smartwatch for 99$? You can buy one of those crappy chinese no-brand ones. Or add 30 and get a Pebble 2. Zsolt V I won't buy it until it's $29 and also doubles as a cock-ring. Dave Maybe some release dates for Nexus devices? :P mike shwilly You can't count 1 year from 5x/6p release? m477 They might release them earlier this year. Darth Vader October 4th. Paul_Werner LTE & GPS you say? Watch someone somehow get Pokemon Go working on this and kill the battery faster than you can say Raichu Daniel Gherard Everybody is asking for NFC and I'm just here hoping for a Soli Chip on the larger one. Surfine Same here! I hope it's built into both watches. Manuel Salcedo what the fuck is this shitty shit? will google never understand that WE DONT NEED LTE ON A FUCKING WATCH? wtf for real? instea they should Add NFC for god SAKE. they keep making the same mistakes, also it SHOULD be compatible with google MODE straps, if not, they killing it, and the maller one look like the strap is FOR FEMALE ONLY, i mean, who the hell will use a 18mm strap? what the fuck is on theyr fuckin brains? Arthur Dent What is wrong with you? Plombir You should switch to decaf. TriguyRN Yikes. mike shwilly Probably found some Indian intern now he whispers all the secrets Impheatus I'll decide between this, Moto 360 3rd Gen (Probably out on September) and Huawei Watch 2016 (if they release one). mike shwilly Moto 360?

Gerardo Sarabia Who knows, maybe, just maybe they named it after the form factor not the actual screen. NoNotThatOne I don't need the lte and I can sacrifice GPS for a cheaper smart watch, but it would be nice if they both have a heart rate monitor. I can get location and notifications from the Bluetooth connection to a phone, but the the heart rate monitor would make it truly functional with fitness apps. A smartphone doesn't normally have that, at least not where it's convenient to use while active (like the Galaxy s6). youareme7 I agree though GPS would have been ideal on the small one. Not sure I want the monster for that, Def don't need lte YuCMi These smart watches will fail because they will be too expensive. They're not worth the cost for the novelty feature of looking at your wrist for notifications when your smartphone is a second away. TheSpaceUnicorn *In your opinion YuCMi Nope, not my opinion, but pretty much fact from observations on the smartwatch market thus far. TheSpaceUnicorn Nope, smart watches being overpriced and only for notifications is most certainly your opinion, and there's no way around that. Lou Hoffman Don't speak for everyone. I've found them very useful for the notifications alone, not to mention music playback controls, and hell...telling the time. I've seen many, many watches cost a lot more, and only tell time. Badouken I never thought about music playback controls... holy hell that sounds amazing! I might just get one of these watches! Lou Hoffman Music Boss has apps for both Android Wear as well as Pebble. Both are great... although I prefer using it on my Pebble because of the physical buttons. TriguyRN My primary uses, in order of how useful are as follows 1. Telling time 2. Controlling music playback 3. Turn by turn navigation 4. Google fit tracking 5. Notifications ConCal I was hoping for less bezel, but it looks good. Đức Thành Stunning, especially the swordfish model. whispy_snippet If Google Assistant works as well as they look I might actually be interested. Laurent Battery life .... battery life .... "- Oh you have a watch, please, what is the time ?" "- Sorry it is discharged ...." I'll stay on Pebble. Marty The latest AW update dramatically improved BL...at least on my Zenwatch 2 and Moto360x2. person 1st Gen Moto 360 notwithstanding, you'd be hard pressed to kill an AW watch in a day and with a dock, it's generally more practical to charge it every night than not. Jim I'll stick with my Gear S2. TriguyRN Can anyone explain LTE functionality to me? Do I stick in a data sim and have notifications rerouted to me through my phone? Do I need some sort of identical sim to my phone's with a number? Do I need to stick one in at all? Is project Fi a good way to go about this? TIA PS if Angelfish has NFC I'll buy one. James Perhaps it will use the new embedded sim standard like that samsung watch though carriers would need to get on board with this first youareme7 The LG one has a nano Sim, it's a data plan (at least on att when I had one in the fall) David I just want project Soli to be ready for these or I may hold off on purchasing a smart watch until it is implemented. Marty Someday somebody is going to figure out how to do a round display connection without having to cut a flat edge into it and still have a small bezel. Orlando Sablon III Dang, Google forcing me to spend this money. I do wish that they add the ability to pair two devices... Major Sceptic I contemplated getting a smart watch, but to me they just don't tick enough boxes over a smart phone, and battery life will sucks, I think they should be focusing on battery life as no. 1 priority. m477 If battery is your priority, you should get a Pebble or a Germin. Jordan L I'll take the small one. I'm glad Google is going to make "Nexus" watches. person I was hoping the Swordfish would have a 20mm band but that looks pretty slender (especially assuming Angelfish has a 22mm band). Hopefully there are size options or it changes before release. abc Not even remotely excited about a smartwatch. whispy_snippet Smart watches are still a while off being the must have, super capable, super intuitive devices they can be. But with a genuine purpose that differentiates them from phones they will get there. Something like a fully fleshed out Google Now or Google Assistant have the potential to transform the category entirely. Imagine a device that can anticipate your next move with 100% accuracy. And sure, voice search and voice interaction with a mobile device still kinda sucks right now. But imagine a future when you can literally talk to a device like you would a person and it understands you. This time is coming. And when it does the world will change again. TheJunkie If i can't have at least 5 days in between charges, it really doesn't matter what you can do with it. surethom I agree but even minimum 3 days would be a vast improvement. TheJunkie I understand that's a whole lot better than 10 hours, but after using one that lasts 4 days (obviously not android wear), I know it really needs to be 5 days for people who travels:) vmxr they look affordable jack galler If the small one was $100 or so, I'd be very game. powell I will be around $250, I think. Judging from the Nexus phones, Google is not very eager to make their devices too cheap. Jack Smith Any word on if they have the TPUs? This would get us real-time voice recognition and offline. TPU = TensorFlow Processors Jack Smith Will I be able to play Pokemon Go on it? kalyan Is there a significant difference between the android ware watches and smart watches,,?? Sharky Android wear watches are smart watches... kalyan As I know not exactly bcz samsung gear 2 neo, apple watch are not comes into android wear, moto 360 etc... are android wear watches. surethom Both need Heart Rate Monitor. Swordfish better size watch but the straps look too thin, wont look good on a mans wrist, but will have to wait & see. Chris no flat tire, not buying Ignacio Azzi They have a nostalgic ICS look Jase Ruggles I'm calling fake. As an Industrial designer in the industry, I see very little detail in those designs, it looks like pretty amateur quality that is missing a lot of basic details. These renders are pretty poor quality also. Any monkey with a keyshot license could do 5x better. And that watch face definitely does not look legit either. Kinda surprised these are getting so much attention. Gerardo Sarabia Well, Google's never been the best when it comes to hardware design. They still need to figure out a design language that's common across devices, right now it is a big mess and it will probably stay like that for a few years until the new hardware division catches up. Just like it took them years to figure out what they wanted to do with software design and now we have Material Design. DozensOfUs Industrial designer my ass. Mayoo Couldn't resist. Honest abe There is one champion in watches and that's the gear s nothing can touch it samsung could keep avoiding the obvious for but so long I hope they lose in sales people are not stupid we want a watch that has everything stop Separating the tech I would really love to know who decided on that ugly design? ? 6500G00N Angelfish looks great! Angelic even! the closed pistachio Please please please have Soli built in!! the closed pistachio Also hope they keep that holo blue aesthetic :) Andrew Please be waterproof, please be waterproof to 50m... TylerChappell Sailfish, Marlin, Swordfish, Angelfish. Google is making me hungry for seafood again. Any other fish names floating about your backbone AP to indicate any new Nexus tablets on the horizon? Perhaps not? Then I guess I gotta upgrade my 32GB Nexus 9 to a 64GB Pixel C. Faheem Ahmed 100% pfgreen Maybe Google will offer a package deal: one watch and one new google branded phone with a discount off the prices of separate purchases. surethom Any new news on the Google smartwatches?

Google Home app says multiple users are now supported Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 1:01am PDTApr 10, 2017 70 Plus 1 on G+ 141 Share on Facebook 130 Share on Twitter Total Shares341 Applications Google News We've known for a while that multiple user support would come to Google Home. It only makes sense that a device placed in the home can be used by several persons instead of being linked to just one user's data and music and other accounts. But until now, we had only seen the signs of multi-user support in Cody's teardown of the app. Today though, users have started seeing a new card in the Discover tab of the Google Home app titled "Multiple users now supported." The card says that you and others in your house can enjoy a "personalized experience" from Assistant on the Google Home, but so far the feature doesn't appear to be live just yet. Maybe someone jumped the gun a little too soon on the new card, but it does tell us that the feature should be active soon. We've reached out to Google to clarify and will update this post if we get an answer. Hopefully, this means that Assistant on the Google Home can catch up with the one on your phone and start offering all the options that were previously inaccessible due to privacy or security concerns, like adding personal reminders, sending messages, and creating calendar events.

Rita El Khoury The timing with the shopping list move from Google Keep to Home/Assistant is certainly telling. I think we might hear more about Assistant and Home today, officially. jamez243 No update from Google about this yet? Andy J I expect it will be more likely to be May (I/O) Artem Russakovskii Reminders, reminders, reminders, reminders! Dennis Ulijn Calendar! Mail! Notes! Nicholas Conrad Oh my! codemonkey85 But which reminders? Assistant reminders? Google Now reminders? Keep reminders? Inbox reminders? Calendar reminders? Google Tasks? Eric Braun I've found that my calendar and inbox reminders work as one, and i rarely use keep reminders. Adam Margeson Generally speaking, reminders are global and will show in Google, Calendar and Inbox. If a Keep note is attached to it, it will show up in Keep. Tasks has always been a separate "thing" unrelated to Google's "Reminders". Alfonso Surroca Google Engineer: "Hey Google, remind me to add reminder functionality to Google Home" Google Assistant: "I'm sorry, I can't do that yet." Steve Wright Now, if only we could say "Okay HAL", instead of "Okay Google". Averix Or maybe actually choose our own trigger entirely. Motorola let you do that back on the Droid line to get into Google Now. It was so much more convenient and you could pick a phrase that didn't make everyone look at you when in public. addicuss Developers! Developers! Developers! Developers! tismondo Same day they move the shopping list to Google Express. Google giveth, and Google taketh away. Hoping this is all part of a big update bringing lots of other features. b_boogey_xl *waits for Google's Keyword blog post* whispy_snippet This has always been the deal breaker for me. With multi user support I reckon I'll be ready to jump on board... Once it actually officially launches in Australia that is. Ian Aitken Been waiting for multi user support on this since i got it. However might be some teathing issues or a bad update because my Google home stopped responding to Ok Google today, If i do a factory reset and reconfigure it with the app it works for about 5 mins then goes back to failing. Anyone else? (Australian who imported 4 months ago) Summerer If only I would get Assistant on my phone in the first place... So much for a rollout in Germany Google gusano38 For some reason the assistant stopped working on my Nexus 5 (Lineage OS). I just cleared all data in the google app (from the app info menu) and it started working again... you should maybe try this ;). codemonkey85 I've got a Nexus 5 on 6.0.1 in the USA and I don't have Assistant yet either. What gives, Google? Andy J Still waiting on an LGG4 in the UK so I wouldn't hold your breath. surethom Now give us a 1. graphical equaliser to reduce the Bass as its way to much on Google home 2. The new shopping list they will work Offline Paulo The easiest way to solve this problem is allowing separate wake words for each user. Kids=Barney, Me=Computer, Wife=Google. Problem solved. rslh Brilliant! SavageJeep Privacy issue would still be there. I could text or access my wife's calendar. Not sure how Google's update will fix this however. Gerardo Sarabia mix voice recognition and different hotwords and you have a winner to start. cusaitech Barney lol. That would be a cute idea :) Christopher Larsen There seems to be a new option on the screen where you choose a default music provider that also indicates multiple accounts are coming soon. Hopefully they'll enable it sometime this week =] Good_Ole_Pinocchio Can this thing send text messages yet? Abhilash Bingi It can't, but at least it won't hijack the command from your phone anymore. If both your phone and GH listen to the command, your phone will handle calls and texts. Impulse_Vigil That's new? Why didn't they implement these fallback from the start? Not like they need user recognition for that, well, maybe... Guess it depends on where/how phones are lying about and how the fallback is handled. Presumably these new settings set a default phone/master user or something? dcdttu Good news, everyone! Now more than one person can experience the features that still aren't implemented in Google Home! Patel Nisha The voice recognition aspect is the thing that is needed. I was really excited about this until I heard it was switching via the app and not dynamically switching based on voice recognition. I’d love it if it detected who was speaking and used a different voice for the assistant so you knew for sure you were under your account. Isn’t voice recognition already a solved problem? Andy J Why do you think it's switching via the app? Everything I have heard so far - is that it will recognise who is speaking to it, switching via the app makes absolutely no sense - because if you have already had to get your phone to switch accounts - you might as well just ask your phone whatever it was you were going to ask Home. I know Google can make some questionable design choices at times - but this would be a end-of-product design choice. That said... here I am in the UK - several days after the UK launch - developing actions for Google Assistant which work 100% fine in the web simulator - but when I ask my real device "talk to my media assistant" I get told that I can't preview actions while I have my language set to British English, which seems like something they should of fixed before releasing it in the UK (especially since it appears to apply to published apps too). TheCarlosFontes I like asking Google Home what sound a peacock makes and then watching my dog freak out haha Total Insecurity Lul JG Would this cause Google to "forget" my preferred music service? Last night I asked Google to play some music and she informed me I had yet to select a default music service, that I would have to do so through the Google Home app. Pretty sure I did that back November/December when I set it up initially. At least the "Hey Google, play [music]" command has always worked up to last night. Haven't opened the app yet to re-confirm my default service. I 'cheated' and got it to work re-issuing the command adding "On Google Play Music".

Image: Anzhuo By Rohan Naravane The first Google Pixel had some features that stood out in 2016 — the rear camera was stellar, Google Assistant was the best assistant on a phone, and the unlimited, uncompressed photo storage was a god-send. But beyond this, the Pixel was pretty much a dull phone — and we don’t just mean in appearance. It is true that the focus of any phone Google has made — Nexus or Pixel — has been on delivering the best Android software experience. But it is natural for a consumer to make comparisons, especially when purchasing a phone as expensive as the Pixel or Pixel XL. And so, here are five things that the Pixel 2 better have in 2017, if it wants to compete with the best of Android — like the Samsung Galaxy S8, the LG G6, and the 10th anniversary iPhone. Better Design There have been two consistent opinions on the Internet about the design of the Pixel phones — one is that they look a lot like the iPhone, and the other that they’re plain boring when compared to curved-glass phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. The first criticism is hard to deny — if you were to look at the front side of the Pixel and an iPhone 7, the resemblance can’t be denied. Not to mention HTC, the company contracted to manufacture these phones, also built its own iPhone clone not too long ago, which coincidentally also looks similar to the Pixel. All in all, the Pixel phones look like something Google put together in a hurry. The second part of the complaint, although subjective, deserves some credibility because when people are expected to shell the kind of money to buy one today, the device better not be as mild-looking. Personally, the squarish chunk of glass right above the aluminium back feels out of place. Oh, and that glass panel apparently breaks rather easily too. Finally, the huge bezels at the top and bottom are also not appreciated by many, as the space could’ve been reduced to make the phone more handy. We can only hope that the Pixel 2 will have a better design than the first Pixel. Proper Water Resistance FILE – In this Feb. 22, 2016 file photo, a waterproof Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge mobile phone is submersed in water during a preview of Samsung’s flagship store. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Google reportedly did ‘run out of time’ to make the first Pixel phones truly water and dust resistant. This is said to be the reason why they are IP53 certified, and not IP67 or IP68. In layman terms, IP53 means the Pixel phones available today can survive casual splashes of water, but there are less chances of it surviving if dipped inside water than an IP67 or IP68 certified phone. Now, very few people will willingly want to dunk their smartphone inside water. But here are the facts — almost every flagship phone today, be it the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, the LG G6, etc — are better prepared for survival if they’re submerged accidentally. So Google may have ran out of time to get it right in the first go, but there are no excuses for the Pixel 2 to not have a better water and dust resistance rating. Stereo Speakers The lack of stereo speakers in the Google Pixel and Pixel XL was a complete surprise, given that its spiritual predecessor — the Nexus 6P — had a pair of front-firing speakers. A single bottom-firing speaker is not the most ideal position, especially when you’re watching videos with the phone held sideways. There’s a good chance your finger might block the output, and you also need to cup the speaker to listen to the many videos on the Internet that don’t have optimised audio. Having two speaker grilles on either sides of the display gives you a neat stereophonic effect. An issue with having two grilles on the face though is that it ruins the clean appearance that the Pixel phones of today have. To mitigate this problem, phone makers like HTC and Apple ended up using the earpiece as the second speaker grille, with the secondary speaker placed at the bottom. This may not be the most ideal setup, but it at least ends up being usable for the times when you don’t have earphones handy. Dual Rear Camera Setup Apple wasn’t the first feature a two-camera setup on the iPhone 7 Plus, but it sure has put the concept on the map. The dual lens setup allows for 2x zooming without losing detail. The arrangement is also used to blur the background, effectively making the subject in a portrait stand out, popularly known as the bokeh effect. On the other hand, you have the LG G6, which also features a two-lens setup, but with different functionality. Next to a typical 13 MP sensor is a secondary one with the same resolution, but a 125-degree wide-angle lens. While the iPhone 7 Plus lets you get closer to a subject without moving, this takes a wider photo without having to move backwards. Imagine you’re standing in a narrow lane and want to capture a wider frame, the G6’s secondary camera will let you do exactly that. The first Pixel phones deserve a pat on the back to go toe-to-toe with the best that Apple and Samsung had to offer in terms of imaging. I sincerely hope Google employs a multi-lens setup, simply because the use cases mentioned above are highly useful. Not as buggy as the first Pixel The Google Pixel XL The Google Pixel and Pixel XL have bagged many headlines in the last five months post launch — but mostly for the wrong reasons. Almost every week, there would be reports of some or the other issue that Pixel owners are facing. Just to cite a few, these premium smartphones were plagued with microphone failures, image distortion issues, unintended lens flare, and many, many more. It’s really a shame since HTC has been making smartphones for nearly 20 years now. And Google is no stranger to hardware either — it has partnered with several manufacturers in the past to create the Nexus line of smartphones. Phones made by the likes of OnePlus or Xiaomi may be forgiven to have an issue or two, considering they’re selling them at price points you can’t possibly argue with. Also, no device is perfect, and even the best of phones have had their hardware issues — we don’t need to remind you of Samsung’s Note 7 fiasco, or the iPhone bendgate or antennagate. But for a premium-positioned device like the Google Pixel, having a plethora of issues leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Conclusion If you’ve read until here, you may be glad to know that this rant is over. It is obvious that the Pixel can’t possibly have every feature on the planet — but the ones mentioned above have become mainstream enough to warrant an inclusion. Now that the company has taken the bold move of competing with their longtime partners, if the Pixel effort is to mean anything, Google better give everything it’s got to this product line, no holds barred.

Now, Google has apparently made a big move in the sector, offering display manufacturer LG a hefty investment. According to ET News (Google Translate), Google has offered to invest one trillion won ($876-million) in LG‘s Display division in order to ramp up production of flexible OLED screens. The publication says that the size of the investment could still increase. It’s also expected that Google would receive priority on screens if the deal is confirmed. Google is expected to use the displays in its latest round of Pixel smartphones. But it’s not the only company looking to secure a ton of OLED screens… Google seems really serious about securing a production line for OLED screens… The move comes as rumours persist that Apple will release an OLED iPhone. It’s expected that Apple’s decision will result in huge demand for the technology. In fact, a Bloomberg report claims that the technology is already in short supply. The report says that Apple is tipped to only release one OLED-equipped iPhone specifically because the tech isn’t available in huge quantities. It’s widely expected that Apple will also release two LCD-equipped iPhones. According to Nikkei, Apple has reached a deal with Samsung to provide 70 million displays for the new iPhone. “Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations,” an IHS analyst told Nikkei.

Tags AlphaGo Asia, Science And Tech World's top Go player says he is set to beat Google's AI China Daily/ANN | Tuesday, Apr 11, 2017 Ke Jie, the world's No 1 Go player, according to Go Rating rankings. Photo: China Daily/ANN China Daily/ANN Tuesday, Apr 11, 2017 Despite the losing streak that human board game champions have had at the hands of artificial intelligence opponents, the world's No 1 Go player, 19-year-old Ke Jie of China, says he's determined to beat Google's AlphaGo next month. Ke, the top-ranked human player, will challenge AI programme AlphaGo, developed by Google DeepMind, in a best-of-three contest as part of the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, from May 23 to 27, the Chinese Go Association said on Monday. The showdown will be the latest between elite human Go players and AlphaGo, which defeated South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol 4-1 in a match in March 2016 before racking up 60 straight wins against human players from China, South Korea and Japan－including Ke－in fast-paced online matches as of January. The upcoming match will be in a different format. Despite AI's advantages in strategic thinking and unpredictable tactics, Ke said he is all set to beat AlphaGo on behalf on humans this time. "I feel honoured to represent humans in taking on AI opponents again. AlphaGo has proved its undisputed prowess in the game, but I will never give up any chance to win," said Ke, who holds multiple world titles. "I will maintain a do-or-die state of mind to try to beat it." Ke will win $1.5 million if he can defeat AlphaGo, said Hua Xueming, leader of China's national Go team. Go, which originated in ancient China, is a game where two players take turns placing black and white stones on a grid of 19-by-19 squares to try to take control of the most territory on the board. While Ke was beaten by AlphaGo during its 60 wins in the fast-paced format, which requires each contender to make at least three moves every 20 seconds, the clash between Ke and AlphaGo in Wuzhen will take place in classic format, which allows each contender more time to think through their moves. "If he is given more time to develop his play, I think Ke has a chance to win this time around," Hua said. Alongside Ke's individual match, the summit will include pair and team competitions with other high-ranking Chinese professional players like Lian Xiao and Gu Li. In the pair format, Lian and Gu will face off, with each having an AlphaGo teammate. Also, five Chinese players will play together, alternating moves, to test AlphaGo's adaptability to their combined style in the team event. Scott Beaumont, president of Google Greater China, envisions a unique chance to explore the mysteries of the game while pushing the limits of AI development. "Ultimately, it's about the development of the game by finding new methods, new possibilities. ... You've got a group of computer scientists who love the game combined with professionals who have a deep passion for the game, exploring possibilities that before that combination wouldn't have existed. I think that's a beautiful thing," he said. Sign up for our e-newsletter now! Get all the latest news, lifestyle and trending stories, delivered to your inbox!

Institutions Solutions for Governments Solutions for Professionals REGISTER LOGIN Advertisement Home Article Dubai Chamber, Google form partnership to help business 11 April, 2017 11 April 2017 GOOGLE and the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry have announced their long-term partnership to help businesses across Dubai get online during the 11th World Retail Congress, which recently took place in the emirate. The three-day Congress was held under the theme “Reimagining the Customer Experience”, and brought together 1,500 attendees, including 150 industry leaders and experts, to discuss key trends impacting the global retail sector, including transformation and disruption, changing attitudes of tech-savvy consumers, and the importance of brand differentiation. The partnership aims to help local businesses across different sizes and industries harness the power of the web, get discovered more easily, and in turn get more customers. According to the Consumer Connected Study, the UAE’s Smartphone and Internet usage is one of the highest in the world. Research also shows that 63% of consumers in the country use their smartphones to look for local businesses. Yet, only 18% of businesses have any online presence, and many business owners (96%) feel their digital implementation is still ‘early to mild’. Advertisement This long-term agreement will launch with a pilot program that will extend for three to four months. Both partners will work on gathering data of businesses, getting them verified and listed on Google Search and Maps via a free tool known as Google My Business. Listings include useful information for consumers, such as a company’s phone number, hours of operation, and business description. The collaboration will also involve future digital trainings which will help businesses better understand the value of being online, growing a business, and acquiring new customers. Hamad Buamim, President and CEO, Dubai Chamber, said: “We are delighted to partner with Google on such an important initiative as it will help local businesses boost their global profile and reach, and give them access to a much bigger consumer base. This partnership falls in line with our strategy to enhance the competitiveness of Dubai’s private sector, promote smarter business practices locally, and improve ease of doing business in the emirate.” Buamim added: “Considering the rapid pace at which technology is evolving, it has become critical for businesses to invest in building their brand reputation online, target consumers through digital channels, and keep up with the changing needs of their tech-savvy customers.” Lino Cattaruzzi, Managing Director for Google in MENA, said: “For most people in the UAE, the internet is their first point for information. We wanted to make the process of businesses getting online easier and help them find their customers in the moments that matter. We decided to partner with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce who understands the challenges faced by local businesses better than anyone—and they recognize the value of getting businesses online.” Cattaruzzi added: “This is just the beginning. There is more to do to help businesses take advantage of the vast opportunities yielded by the web which in turn will help the local economy benefit. We are starting with a pilot program and hope to scale it further in the future.” © The Saudi Gazette 2017 © Copyright Zawya. All Rights Reserved.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

AJKahn A very brave pick for the first post. Guess I'm going to be looking forward for your "hopefully weekly" columns, Trevor (most likely not the one from GTA V). MrDrWho13 Is this the guy you hired after that ad? Was this the article which got him the place? I quite like this writing style. VAVAMk_2 We wouldn't be giving him the warm welcome to AP if we weren't hard on him ;) dcdttu "...couldn't care less" abc Any writer whose first post on this site is criticism of Google (especially the Pixel), gets my support! A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! By Steve Lohr TORONTO: Long before Google started working on cars that drive themselves and Amazon was creating home appliances that talk, a handful of researchers in Canada - backed by the Canadian government and universities - were laying the groundwork for today's boom in artificial intelligence. But the centre of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada's young AI scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of AI startups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills are abundant. "Canada is not really reaping the benefits from this AI technical leadership and decades of investment by the Canadian government," said Tiff Macklem, former senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, who is dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. Now bringing AI home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country's expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country. And they want to build on the tenacity of veteran researchers like Geoffrey Hinton, Richard Sutton and Yoshua Bengio, who developed techniques that opened the door to remarkable improvements in an AI technology called machine learning, even as many computer scientists and the tech industry considered their work to be an unpromising backwater. There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture startups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and American venture capitalists. In its new budget, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged $93 million to support AI research centres in Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton, which will be public-private collaborations. The Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Toronto, announced two weeks ago, will be one of them. The institute begins with commitments of $130 million, about half the money coming from the national and provincial governments and the other half from corporate sponsors like Google, Accenture and Nvidia, as well as big Canadian companies like the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and Air Canada. Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are also adding to their AI research teams in Canada.

Join For Free Learn how API management supports better integration in Achieving Enterprise Agility with Microservices and API Management, brought to you in partnership with 3scale I am working on profiling 75 of the Google APIs, and one thing I struggle with at this scale is standardizing the images I use — or, more specifically, icons that represent each service as well as the value they deliver under the hood. This is something Google seriously needs to get more organized in, by the way. I have written before about having a set of icons for the API sector and for SDK-related icons, and also about how Amazon is getting more organized when it comes to icons for the AWS platform, as I beat this drum about the need for common imagery. While I am glad that Amazon is started to think about iconography when it comes to working with APIs at scale, a lead that Google and Microsoft should follow, I'm hoping that API icons are something that someone will tackle at the same level as, say, Schema.org. I would like to see API provider (company)-level icons building on the work of Devicon, but I'd also like to see individual icons developed for common resources that are made available via APIs like compute, storage, images, video, etc. What Amazon is doing provides the best model we have so far, but I want to make sure icons are not vendor-specific. I would like to see a universal icon to represent a compute API, for instance, whether it was Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. Think about IFTTT or Zapier, but something that would universally represent the valuable bits and bytes we are putting to use via individual platforms, but are increasingly also moving around between platforms. I want a common visual iconography we can use to communicate about what is being done with APIs. There is a ton of work involved with establishing a project of this scale. Ideally, it is something that would also involve API providers and not just be an external thing. I'd also like to see each icon be more than just a visual icon, I'd like there to be semantics and vocabulary attached to each image. Imagine if we had a common set of icons describe Machine Learning APIs that helped us quickly understand what they do but would also help us more consistently articulate the reality of what they do and do not do (i.e. facial recognition, sentiment analysis, etc.). I am going to keep talking about this until someone either does it or gives me the money to pay someone to do it. Sadly, I feel like it will end up being like the rest of common API definitions and tooling — we'll see each provider do it on their own, where all meaning and vocabulary becomes platform-driven and not about actually finding a common language to communicate about what is possible with APIs.

Added new frameworks. The artificial intelligence, personal assistant and chatbot space has been growing rapidly. The idea of having a personal assistant you can beckon with the words “Siri”, “Alexa”, “Cortana” or “Ok Google” which connects us to the web and the ever growing Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming ever more commonplace. Almost every messenger program and smartphone OS have chatbots or personal assistants available in 2017! While their true level of “artificial intelligence” is debatable, we are witnessing the start of a world where we all have virtual assistants at our disposal! Luckily for developers who want to get in on the action, there are a range of services available that make it simple to get started with the basics of building your own artificial intelligence, chatbot and/or personal assistant for whatever purpose you can dream up. Connect up your smart home, control a self made media center, deliver all sorts of information via a personal AI assistant… there are so many options available thanks to APIs and services. This lead up throughout 2015 and 2016 has made 2017 the year where developers have more options than ever before. Developers really can start building solutions of their own. In this overview, we’ll look at the services that exist which can enable developers to begin connecting their own apps and IoT devices to voice recognition, chatbots and artificial intelligence throughout 2016. Wit.ai Wit.ai is a service which provides a nice combination of both voice recognition and machine learning for developers. It provides the service to convert verbal commands into text and can also be trained up in how to understand those commands. It also has a form of machine learning, where you can train it to understand commands which are said to it which it previously didn’t understand, however this isn’t an automatic process (it’s not a totally intelligent being yet!). Early in 2015, they joined Facebook and opened up the entire platform to be free for both public and private instances. Its development has been up and down since then, but the team have big plans for 2017. Wit.ai has two main elements to it that you set up within your app — intents and entities. An intent is what action an instruction should take (e.g. turn on a light). An entity is a specific object or piece of information that our AI needs to know about to enact that intent (e.g. which light? Is it a smart light? Should it understand particular colors the light can switch to?). Rather than needing to create intents from scratch, Wit.ai also provides access to existing intents from the developer community which is quite neat! Wit.ai also has the concept of “roles”, where it can learn to differentiate between entities in different contexts (e.g. numbers in different parts of an instruction can refer to different things – like an age, an order, a count). It also has some entity types built in that it can understand, such as temperature, URLs, emails, duration… etc. A new feature in Wit.ai is the “Story” feature, which allows you to define typical conversations in a new way. You can set up the initial question, like “What’s the weather in Sydney?” and then define the steps and subsequent questions that the system should ask. It has the concept of “branches” which move the conversation in different ways if the system doesn’t get all the required information up front (e.g. if the user instead says “What’s the weather?”). There is a Wit.ai API for developers of iOS, Android, Node.js, Raspberry Pi, Ruby, Python, C, Rust and Windows Phone. It even has a JavaScript plugin for front end developers. Api.ai Api.ai is a chatbot API which provides similar capabilities to Wit.ai, with intents and entities. It provides machine learning capabilities which can sometimes guess if someone uses a slightly different phrase than you’ve hardcoded into your assistant. They recently were purchased by Google in September 2016. It is now one of the main ways to build conversational interfaces for Google’s Home platform. One key focus of Api.ai that differs from Wit.ai is its “Domains”. Domains are a whole collection of knowledge and data structures from Api.ai that are ready for use in every Api.ai agent (apps are called “agents” in Api.ai). Domains can include knowledge of common verbs and content types. As an example, it understands the different types of data that a request of “Book restaurant” needs, compared to “Book hotel”. It has a range of real information about encyclopedia-like topics such as history, word definitions, people of significance (e.g. celebrities, writers, characters), movies, stock prices and a lot more. Api.ai is free to use but it is a little bit misleading on their website at the moment — it isn’t completely free as of 2016. Most of the “Domains” now require your account to be upgraded, however the price for this isn’t clear (developers will need to contact Api.ai’s sales team). Api.ai also still has a paid enterprise option which allows for the whole service to be run on a private cloud internally and more from their services team. This is potentially valuable if your usage needs to be totally private. Api.ai has SDKs for Android, iOS, the Apple Watch, Node.js, Cordova, Unity, C++, Xamarin, Python and JavaScript. The Unity integration in particular might open this up to a range of additional platforms not listed above! It also can be integrated with Amazon’s Echo, Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Microsoft’s Cortana and much more. If you’d like to give Api.ai a try, I’ve got a series on getting started with Api.ai here at SitePoint. Just keep in mind that the domains have since required a paid account, so my example I put together doesn’t answer every question any longer as I don’t have a paid account. Melissa If you’d rather do more of the programming side of the AI yourself and you are a fan of Raspberry Pi, you could look into Melissa. Melissa is an open source personal assistant written in Python that runs on Raspberry Pi, Windows, OS X and Linux. It’s updated quite frequently and has quite a few who speak very highly of it! Melissa has always-on voice control and has a range of sample dialogues out of the box, including things like taking notes, telling your horoscope, getting definitions from Wikipedia, playing music and more. For the Python developer who wants total control – Melissa might just be for you! To find out more and get full details on how it is put together, Tanay Pant, it’s main developer, has a whole book that covers it in more detail and serves as the detailed documentation for Melissa. I actually spoke with him all about Melissa at the start of the year. He’s done a lot of work on it! Clarifai One service from a completely different perspective is Clarifai, an artificial intelligence service that can recognize image and video content. It has its own deep learning engine that continuously improves with every use. If you are keen to take your AI prototype to a whole new level, why not give it the ability to see and recognize objects? It can do all sorts of things from tagging images, searching for other images that are visually similar and flagging inappropriate images. If you want to take it to the next level, you can even teach the platform entirely new concepts by training it with your own examples. To integrate this into your own applications, Clarifai has both a REST API that could be integrated with your preferred language along with a Python, Java and Node.js API. Their service is free for up to 5000 uses a month. I’ve got a guide on using Clarifai here at SitePoint for those who’d like to give it a go — How to Make Your Web App Smarter with Image Recognition. TensorFlow If you are wanting to go beyond services which do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and really want to make true artificial intelligence systems from relative scratch, Google’s TensorFlow might be the option for you! While it’s something that will take longer to put together, you’ll learn a lot more about deep learning and artificial intelligence. TensorFlow is “an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs”. It would be best for things like training your own image recognition system or learning to do language processing. You could also make conversational AI with TensorFlow that is trained on specific data, such as SpeakEasy AI which was a chatbot built on a neural model trained on millions of comments from Reddit. There’s no limit to the sorts of things you could get a TensorFlow-powered program to do, this developer trained it to write new episodes of hit 90s show, Friends. More from this author There Are More Virtual Reality Headsets Than You Realize! Forecasting the Weather with Your Raspberry Pi and Bluemix Conclusion There are a range of services and APIs out there which can provide artificial intelligence, personal assistants, chatbots and more. You don’t need to be a computer science expert to implement some of the core basics in your own apps! Try out a few of the above and see what you can create. If you feel super confident, go straight for TensorFlow and make something seriously mindblowing. If you do put together your own AI prototype using any of the above services, or you’ve had some experience with the above or a service I did not mention — please share it in the comments or get in touch with me on Twitter (@thatpatrickguy).

Yesterday also saw the search engine launch its Asia-Pacific (Apac) financial dashboard, sharing details on how consumers in 10 areas across the region — Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam — conducted searches for financial products over the last year. Some of the top financial Google searches in Singapore include: How to make car insurance cheaper”, “Why life insurance is important for future success” as well as “How to avoid pitfalls in getting home equity loans”. The tool takes into account all the different languages. “The topic of insurance is very heavy in Singapore,” said Michael Yue, industry head for banking and financial services, Google Singapore. “Financial literacy in Singapore is one of the highest in Asia and consumers like to be well-informed before making any decisions. Singaporeans care about financial planning and often turn to (Google) Search to help them understand financial products and investments.” With smartphone penetration rate at 91 per cent, Singaporeans have easy access to the Internet and have made it a one-stop platform to gather information and plan their finances, noted Google. Mobile search growth for financial products is increasing by 28 per cent year-on-year, it added. For example, using the mobile to send a search related to “investing” in Singapore drew an approximate query volume of 70 million for last year, compared to Hong Kong’s 40 million query volume, information from the APAC financial dashboard showed. Meanwhile a search related to “general banking” on Google doubled in mobile search volume for Singapore at 40 million, compared to Hong Kong’s 20 million. Yue noted that many organisations have been making “incredible shifts” to digital services in recent years. “They understand that’s where the users are really spending their time. So when you look across all the major local banks, DBS, OCBC, UOB, they are investing quite heavily in digital channels,” he said. “I think it helps with their business (and) automisation as well because a digital channel can assist in either signing up new products or assisting (support) into the branches.” Among the other findings, Google also revealed that the search demand for financial products continues to climb up 11 per cent year-on-year, led by key market factors. Google noticed a peak in searches following topical issues in May to June last year, such as an interest in the Euro following the Brexit announcement, the launch of Digibank by DBS Bank, and the launch of new retail bonds by Oxley and Hyflux. The findings also showed that Singaporeans are savvy about their finances and keenly aware of movements in the financial sectors, Google noted. Two in three conduct their searches with a brand in mind when searching for financial products. “Seventy per cent of Singaporeans turn to their smartphones when they need information about a local business compared to 43 per cent in the United States,” noted Yue. Using insights from Google’s Apac financial dashboard, financial brands can respond better to their consumers and engage them in more relevant ways, both online and offline, he said. ― TODAY                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Activist targets GM share structure, board Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Ringgit down versus greenback Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Activist targets GM share structure, board Malaysian-based I Synergy puts expansion plan in place Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Related Articles Ministry hopes to present padi farmer insurance scheme in Budget 2018 The Merlion’s power as a symbol for Singaporeans ― Wei Jie Yap and Georgios Christopoulos Bomber jacket most searched for fashion item right now, according to Google Singaporeans told to use hearts and minds to counter terrorism Jakarta to conduct stricter screenings on Malaysians, Singaporeans at airports Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The statement once again denies that any pay gap exists within the company, explaining the “gender-blind” way the company makes its salary calculations, which it says is based on “role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings.” Once a salary is calculated by analysts — who Google says have no access to the gender information of the employee in question — it’s then fed into the company’s pay equity model. This is a four-stage process that compares suggested compensation amounts between genders, and theoretically prods the company to make adjustments if any statistical gap is observed. “Our analysis gives us confidence that there is no gender pay gap at Google,” the statement — written by Eileen Naughton, Google’s VP of people operations — reads. Naughton says that Google’s most recent analysis, performed in late 2016 and covering 52 different job categories, found “no gender pay gap.” Google has already published an overview of how to reach a pay equity analysis model for other businesses, and has recently expanded its own system to cover race as well as gender in determining pay, as well as publicly sharing a top-level analysis of how to compensate employees equally in 2016. Google’s expressed methodology would seem to iron out imbalances in wages, but Naughton notes that before pay details are run through the equity model, they can be adjusted by an employee’s line manager — “providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale.” Google uses a supposedly ‘gender-blind’ method to work out pay The response comes after the US Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs claimed it had found “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across [Google’s] entire workforce.” The complaint came in a San Francisco court on Friday, as part of a government case against Google, which seeks to obtain information about how much it pays its workers. The OFCCP demanded compensation information for Google employees in September 2015, but the company pushed back against the demand, arguing that the office’s request was too broad. The DoL finally sued Google in January of this year to get access to the information, but a judge denied a summary motion in February, and the case is still ongoing without the OFCCP having access to the full reports. The company’s statement makes reference to this situation, stating that the OFCCP had reached its conclusion without any supporting data or methodology. The office has not made clear how it reached this conclusion without access to information it originally demanded, but speaking to The Guardian, DoL solicitor Janet Herold said that the office had “received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” She also noted that the investigation was not complete.

Friday Briefs: Shots Fired, a racially charged tale, fastjet campaign going places, 50/50 returns, FM’s junk president cover UK spin-doctors have captured SA media Home Advertising Why we’re dropping Google Ads Why we’re dropping Google Ads Posted By: Nathan Geffenon: April 11, 2017In: Advertising Print Email From today, we’re dropping Google adverts from GroundUp. The Google advertising model is broken: not for Google of course, which is massively profitable, but for us, the publishers who have to put up with poor quality, misleading adverts in exchange for small change. Not too many years ago, newspapers could make real money from advertising. Then along came the Internet, followed by Gumtree, and Google Ads, which with a few minor competitors, became the backbone of online advertising. As readers moved to freely available news on the web, so too did advertising revenue. The Internet has made publications like GroundUp feasible. Because publishing and distribution costs are low for us, we can make our content available at no charge. GroundUp relies mainly on donations, but advertising, we thought, might help. The problem is that nearly all the power in the online advertising relationship lies with Google. Not only do we compete for adverts with other media in the same market; we compete with all the shady advert-laden webpages in the world, irrespective of whether they contain fake news, porn, or other attention-grabbers. With AdSense or Ad Exchange, Google’s two mechanisms for delivering ads, we have very little say in what adverts appear, and we are paid very little. October was GroundUp’s best month for site traffic (our articles get much more traffic on mainstream media that republish us, but we receive no advertising revenue from this). We had over 320 000 visits to the site from nearly 240 000 users. But we made a paltry R2 754 (less than $200) from Google AdSense (329 000 impressions for AdSense fundis). That does not cover the cost of one feature article. Polluting our content Google pays a tiny amount each time an ad appears, and a somewhat larger amount if readers click on an ad. To understand exactly how the payment system works requires several PhDs, a four-digit IQ and stay-awake drugs. But we’d continue to take the small change, which we’re using to build up a little reserve for GroundUp, if it wasn’t for the rubbish which keeps appearing and which we can’t get rid of. For about R20 000 a year, it isn’t worth it to pollute our content with get-rich-quick adverts featuring Patrice Motsepe, Richard Branson and Oprah Winfrey (see image at top of article). We have used Google’s system to ‘block’ the various incarnations of the Motsepe advert from the GroundUp site many times. We have navigated Google’s tortuous online complaint system to write to the company in the hope that a human or artificially intelligent being might take action — to no avail. As someone who in a previous job lodged complaints with the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASASA) against rotten adverts, I do not want to run bogus ads on a site for which I’m responsible. (And I doubt ASASA could get Google to change its ways.) Google apparently employs hundreds of people to block dodgy adverts. Either more people are needed, or Google simply doesn’t care enough about the quality of its adverts. Or it’s an impossible task. These dodgy ads continue to appear on some of the world’s biggest news sites, not just small ones like GroundUp. Whichever way you cut it, Google’s system doesn’t work for any publication that cares enough not to mislead its readers. The final straw came when a few days ago we received a warning notice from Google that we’d violated its policies because we run adverts in our new photo gallery with this image: Google complained about the nudity in this photo that appears on this webpage. Photo: Ashraf Hendricks So Google accepts get-rich-quick ads featuring famous people without their permission, but will not let us run those adverts on a page with a photograph of nudity, even if it depicts news in the public interest. The insane hypocrisy and irony of it! Perhaps at some point online publishers, in South Africa or internationally, will come together, agree to chuck out Google Ads, and find a new way to solicit advertising from reputable companies that pay properly. Meanwhile, we’re dumping Google Ads. Obviously the behemoth in Mountain View won’t miss GroundUp, but we take some pride in saying the feeling’s mutual. Nathan Geffen is the GroundUp editor.

X No guarantees for advertisers as extremists beat Google algorithm Cantillon: YouTube owner’s promise to tackle hate speech is easier said than done about 3 hours ago Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google parent Alphabet, says extremists are getting “underneath the algorithm”. Photograph: Victor J Blue/Bloomberg         It would be wrong to imply that the internet is the only place where advertisers find themselves on a sticky wicket. In their time, advertisers have deserted newspapers accused of persistent criminality (no, thank you and goodbye, News of the World) and television programmes with, ahem, controversial hosts (witness the ongoing withdrawal from Fox show The O’Reilly Factor). However, Google’s current difficulties in persuading advertisers that YouTube and other sites that serve Google ads are safe and appropriate places for their brand is a challenge that the industry has not seen before. The technology giant has promised to hire significantly more people to tackle the issue and take “a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content”. But it is not possible for human monitoring and manual intervention to solve the problem of industrial hate speech. The scale of its advertising networks mean the kind of solution that is required will come in algorithmic form. In the age of “programmatic” or automated ad trading systems, this has been a problem waiting to happen. It is not uncommon today for advertisers to be unaware of where their ads are being placed online. This is because they don’t book ads with particular media brands, but pay various intermediaries to get their ads to a target demographic, often through circuitous routes. Advertisers can opt to “blacklist” certain sites – Kellogg’s move to distance itself from the sexist, racist and anti-Semitic site Breitbart is one example – but this usually only happens in response to activist or consumer pressure. In Google’s case, the issue has exploded in recent months in part because extremists – including those who incite to violence – have found new ways to mask the nature of their content. They are getting “underneath the algorithm”, as Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google parent Alphabet, has put it. At the heart of this story is a worrying loss of control. The difficulty for Google now is figuring out how to regain it. But there are many grey areas in this costly stand-off. As an open, democratised platform, YouTube’s great weakness is also its virtue. Advertisers and agencies in Ireland and other markets are rightly seeking more assurances from Google, including revised “brand safety controls”, but they are also aware that there can be no guarantees.       Topics: Cantillon Eric Schmidt Google Kellogg's YouTube Read More Continued healthy growth of 3.8% expected for 2018 Bank of Ireland being left behind on new payment methods Late 2016 UK growth surge starting to run out of steam State faces unwelcome attention as Trump tackles trade deficit Brexit talks will continue amid nonsensical scaremongering Changes to State broadband scheme may bring legal challenge Retailers fear job losses as landlords roll out rent hikes Elvis record company up for sale at $250m ‘Peak TV’ shows no sign of abating just yet UCD’s College Tribune scoops newspaper of year AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 11 April 2017 | MYT 11:51 AM Fake news, piracy and digital duopoly of Google and Facebook by robert thomson “FAKE NEWS” has seemingly, suddenly, become fashionable. In reality, the fake has proliferated for a decade or more, but the faux, the flawed and the fraudulent are now pressing issues because the full scale of the changes wrought upon the integrity of news and advertising by the digital duopoly — Google and Facebook — has become far more obvious. Google’s commodification of content knowingly, wilfully undermined provenance for profit. That was followed by the Facebook stream, with its journalistic jetsam and fake flotsam. Together, the two most powerful news publishers in human history have created an ecosystem that is dysfunctional and socially destructive. Both companies could have done far more to highlight that there is a hierarchy of content, but instead they have prospered mightily by peddling a flat-earth philosophy that doesn’t distinguish between the fake and the real because they make copious amounts of money from both. Depending on which source you believe, they have close to two-thirds of the digital advertising market — and let me be clear that we compete with them for that share. The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimates they accounted for more than 90% of the incremental increase in digital advertising over the past year. The only cost of content for these companies has been lucrative contracts for lobbyists and lawyers, but the social cost of that strategy is far more profound. It is beyond risible that Google and its subsidiary YouTube, which have earned many billions of dollars from other people’s content, should now be lamenting that they can’t possibly be held responsible for monitoring that content. Monetising yes, monitoring no — but it turns out that free money does come at a price. We all have to work with these companies, and we are hoping, mostly against hope, that they will finally take meaningful action, not only to allow premium content models that fund premium journalism, but also to purge their sites of the rampant piracy that undermines creativity. Your business model can’t be simultaneously based on both intimate, granular details about users and no clue whatsoever about rather obvious pirate sites. Another area that urgently needs much attention is the algorithms that Silicon Valley companies, and Amazon, routinely cite as a supposedly objective source of wisdom and insight. These algorithms are obviously set, tuned and repeatedly adjusted to suit their commercial needs. Yet they also blame autonomous, anarchic algorithms and not themselves when neofascist content surfaces or when a search leads to obviously biased results in favour of their own products. Look at how Google games searches. A study reported in The Wall Street Journal found that in 25,000 random Google searches ads for Google products appeared in the most prominent slot 91% of the time. How is that not the unfair leveraging of search dominance and the abuse of algorithm? All 1,000 searches for “laptops” started with an ad for Google’s Chromebook — 100% of the time. Kim Jong Un would be envious of results like that at election time. And then there are the recently launched Google snippets, which stylistically highlight search results as if they were written on stone tablets and carried down from the mountain. Their sheer visual physicality gives them apparent moral force. The word Orwellian is flagrantly abused, but when it comes to the all-powerful algorithms of Google, Amazon and Facebook, Orwellian is underused. As for news, institutional neglect has left us perched on the edge of the slippery slope of censorship. There is no Silicon Valley tradition, as there is at great newspapers, of each day arguing over rights and wrongs, of fretful, thoughtful agonising over social responsibility and freedom of speech. What we now have is a backlash with which these omnipotent companies are uniquely ill-equipped to cope. Their responses tend to be political and politically correct. Regardless of your own views, you should be concerned that we are entering an era in which these immensely influential publishers will routinely and selectively “unpublish” certain views and news. We stumble into this egregious era at a moment when the political volume in many countries is turned to 10. The echo chamber has never been larger and the reverb room rarely more cacophonous. This is not an entirely new trend, but it has a compounding effect with the combination of “holier than thou” and “louder than thou.” Curiously, this outcome is, in part, a result of the idealism of the Silicon Valley set, and there’s no doubt about the self-proclaimed ideals. They devoutly believe they are connecting people and informing them, which is true, even though some of the connections become conspiracies and much of the information is skimmed without concern to intellectual property rights. Ideas aside, we were supposed to be in a magic age of metrics and data. Yet instead of perfect precision we have the cynical arbitraging of ambiguity — particularly in the world of audiences. Some advertising agencies are also clearly at fault because they, too, have been arbitraging and prospering from digital ambiguity as money in the ad business has shifted from actually making ads to aggregating digital audiences and ad tech, better known as fad tech. And so, as the Times of London has reported, socially aware, image-conscious advertisers find themselves in extremely disreputable places — hardcore porn sites, neofascist sites, Islamist sites. The embarrassment for these advertisers juxtaposed with jaundice is understandable, but the situation is far more serious than mere loss of face. If these sites are getting a cut of the commission, the advertisers are technically funding these nefarious activities. Depending on the type of advertising, it is estimated by the ad industry that a YouTube partner could earn about 55% of the revenue from a video. In recent years, how many millions of dollars have been channelled to organisations or individuals that are an existential threat to our societies? Provenance is profound, and in this age of augmented reality and virtual reality, actual reality will surely make a comeback. Authenticated authenticity is an asset of increasing value in an age of the artificial — understanding the ebb and flow of humanity will not be based on fake news or ersatz empathy, but on real insight.

Dylan McGrath, Contributing Editor 4/11/2017 00:01 AM EDT  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet A recent report out of Japan says three of tech's biggest and most prominent companies are interested in bidding on Toshiba's memory chip business. Can this be true? Here's one to put in the healthy skepticism file: a recent report from a Japanese newspaper claims that Apple, Google and Amazon have all thrown their hats into the bidding for Toshiba's chip business. Hmmmm. A few disclaimers about this up front. First, the report, which originated in the Yomiuri Shimbun a week and a half ago, doesn't include the attribution of any sources. Second, none of the companies mentioned have confirmed its accuracy. But neither qualifier is in and of itself debunks the story. First of all, the fact that Apple, Google and Amazon have all stayed mum on the report is par for the course. Secondly, with the exception of SK Hynix's bid for a stake in Toshiba in February, all of the companies mentioned as bidders in the Toshiba chip sweepstakes so far have come to light through anonymous sources, simply because nobody with any real knowledge of the process is supposed to be talking at all. For most of the past decade, companies have been scrambling to get out of the memory chip business. Some have literally died trying. Is it really conceivable that three of the largest and most successful companies in high tech — none of which are semiconductor suppliers — are willing to plunk down something in the neighborhood of $18 billion to buy their way in? Perhaps not. More recently, news reports have indicated that Toshiba has whittled the list of potential buyers down to a handful, with no further mention of Apple, Google or Amazon (more on this below). Whether there was ever any truth to the report of Apple, Google and Amazon sniffing around Toshiba, the fact that this possibility even generated any smoke at all says two things: the memory business is better positioned right now than it has been in a long time and NAND flash is a very desirable commodity right now in this era of Big Data deluge. "If [the report is] true, it shows Amazon and Google consider flash to be a key component for their datacenters and are willing to put money down to secure supply of this strategic commodity, especially in a market where NAND flash supply is tight," said Greg Wong, founder and principal analyst at Forward Insights, a market research firm focused on the memory chip business.

That could be a problem. by Will Knight April 11, 2017 Last year, a strange self-driving car was released onto the quiet roads of Monmouth County, New Jersey. The experimental vehicle, developed by researchers at the chip maker Nvidia, didn’t look different from other autonomous cars, but it was unlike anything demonstrated by Google, Tesla, or General Motors, and it showed the rising power of artificial intelligence. The car didn’t follow a single instruction provided by an engineer or programmer. Instead, it relied entirely on an algorithm that had taught itself to drive by watching a human do it. Getting a car to drive this way was an impressive feat. But it’s also a bit unsettling, since it isn’t completely clear how the car makes its decisions. Information from the vehicle’s sensors goes straight into a huge network of artificial neurons that process the data and then deliver the commands required to operate the steering wheel, the brakes, and other systems. The result seems to match the responses you’d expect from a human driver. But what if one day it did something unexpected—crashed into a tree, or sat at a green light? As things stand now, it might be difficult to find out why. The system is so complicated that even the engineers who designed it may struggle to isolate the reason for any single action. And you can’t ask it: there is no obvious way to design such a system so that it could always explain why it did what it did. The mysterious mind of this vehicle points to a looming issue with artificial intelligence. The car’s underlying AI technology, known as deep learning, has proved very powerful at solving problems in recent years, and it has been widely deployed for tasks like image captioning, voice recognition, and language translation. There is now hope that the same techniques will be able to diagnose deadly diseases, make million-dollar trading decisions, and do countless other things to transform whole industries. But this won’t happen—or shouldn’t happen—unless we find ways of making techniques like deep learning more understandable to their creators and accountable to their users. Otherwise it will be hard to predict when failures might occur—and it’s inevitable they will. That’s one reason Nvidia’s car is still experimental. Already, mathematical models are being used to help determine who makes parole, who’s approved for a loan, and who gets hired for a job. If you could get access to these mathematical models, it would be possible to understand their reasoning. But banks, the military, employers, and others are now turning their attention to more complex machine-learning approaches that could make automated decision-making altogether inscrutable. Deep learning, the most common of these approaches, represents a fundamentally different way to program computers. “It is a problem that is already relevant, and it’s going to be much more relevant in the future,” says Tommi Jaakkola, a professor at MIT who works on applications of machine learning. “Whether it’s an investment decision, a medical decision, or maybe a military decision, you don’t want to just rely on a ‘black box’ method.” There’s already an argument that being able to interrogate an AI system about how it reached its conclusions is a fundamental legal right. Starting in the summer of 2018, the European Union may require that companies be able to give users an explanation for decisions that automated systems reach. This might be impossible, even for systems that seem relatively simple on the surface, such as the apps and websites that use deep learning to serve ads or recommend songs. The computers that run those services have programmed themselves, and they have done it in ways we cannot understand. Even the engineers who build these apps cannot fully explain their behavior. This raises mind-boggling questions. As the technology advances, we might soon cross some threshold beyond which using AI requires a leap of faith. Sure, we humans can’t always truly explain our thought processes either—but we find ways to intuitively trust and gauge people. Will that also be possible with machines that think and make decisions differently from the way a human would? We’ve never before built machines that operate in ways their creators don’t understand. How well can we expect to communicate—and get along with—intelligent machines that could be unpredictable and inscrutable? These questions took me on a journey to the bleeding edge of research on AI algorithms, from Google to Apple and many places in between, including a meeting with one of the great philosophers of our time.  The artist Adam Ferriss created this image, and the one below, using Google Deep Dream, a program that adjusts an image to stimulate the pattern recognition capabilities of a deep neural network. The pictures were produced using a mid-level layer of the neural network. In 2015, a research group at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York was inspired to apply deep learning to the hospital’s vast database of patient records. This data set features hundreds of variables on patients, drawn from their test results, doctor visits, and so on. The resulting program, which the researchers named Deep Patient, was trained using data from about 700,000 individuals, and when tested on new records, it proved incredibly good at predicting disease. Without any expert instruction, Deep Patient had discovered patterns hidden in the hospital data that seemed to indicate when people were on the way to a wide range of ailments, including cancer of the liver. There are a lot of methods that are “pretty good” at predicting disease from a patient’s records, says Joel Dudley, who leads the Mount Sinai team. But, he adds, “this was just way better.” “We can build these models, but we don’t know how they work.” At the same time, Deep Patient is a bit puzzling. It appears to anticipate the onset of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia surprisingly well. But since schizophrenia is notoriously difficult for physicians to predict, Dudley wondered how this was possible. He still doesn’t know. The new tool offers no clue as to how it does this. If something like Deep Patient is actually going to help doctors, it will ideally give them the rationale for its prediction, to reassure them that it is accurate and to justify, say, a change in the drugs someone is being prescribed. “We can build these models,” Dudley says ruefully, “but we don’t know how they work.” Artificial intelligence hasn’t always been this way. From the outset, there were two schools of thought regarding how understandable, or explainable, AI ought to be. Many thought it made the most sense to build machines that reasoned according to rules and logic, making their inner workings transparent to anyone who cared to examine some code. Others felt that intelligence would more easily emerge if machines took inspiration from biology, and learned by observing and experiencing. This meant turning computer programming on its head. Instead of a programmer writing the commands to solve a problem, the program generates its own algorithm based on example data and a desired output. The machine-learning techniques that would later evolve into today’s most powerful AI systems followed the latter path: the machine essentially programs itself. At first this approach was of limited practical use, and in the 1960s and ’70s it remained largely confined to the fringes of the field. Then the computerization of many industries and the emergence of large data sets renewed interest. That inspired the development of more powerful machine-learning techniques, especially new versions of one known as the artificial neural network. By the 1990s, neural networks could automatically digitize handwritten characters. But it was not until the start of this decade, after several clever tweaks and refinements, that very large—or “deep”—neural networks demonstrated dramatic improvements in automated perception. Deep learning is responsible for today’s explosion of AI. It has given computers extraordinary powers, like the ability to recognize spoken words almost as well as a person could, a skill too complex to code into the machine by hand. Deep learning has transformed computer vision and dramatically improved machine translation. It is now being used to guide all sorts of key decisions in medicine, finance, manufacturing—and beyond. The workings of any machine-learning technology are inherently more opaque, even to computer scientists, than a hand-coded system. This is not to say that all future AI techniques will be equally unknowable. But by its nature, deep learning is a particularly dark black box. You can’t just look inside a deep neural network to see how it works. A network’s reasoning is embedded in the behavior of thousands of simulated neurons, arranged into dozens or even hundreds of intricately interconnected layers. The neurons in the first layer each receive an input, like the intensity of a pixel in an image, and then perform a calculation before outputting a new signal. These outputs are fed, in a complex web, to the neurons in the next layer, and so on, until an overall output is produced. Plus, there is a process known as back-propagation that tweaks the calculations of individual neurons in a way that lets the network learn to produce a desired output. The many layers in a deep network enable it to recognize things at different levels of abstraction. In a system designed to recognize dogs, for instance, the lower layers recognize simple things like outlines or color; higher layers recognize more complex stuff like fur or eyes; and the topmost layer identifies it all as a dog. The same approach can be applied, roughly speaking, to other inputs that lead a machine to teach itself: the sounds that make up words in speech, the letters and words that create sentences in text, or the steering-wheel movements required for driving. “It might be part of the nature of intelligence that only part of it is exposed to rational explanation. some of it is just instinctual.” Ingenious strategies have been used to try to capture and thus explain in more detail what’s happening in such systems. In 2015, researchers at Google modified a deep-learning-based image recognition algorithm so that instead of spotting objects in photos, it would generate or modify them. By effectively running the algorithm in reverse, they could discover the features the program uses to recognize, say, a bird or building. The resulting images, produced by a project known as Deep Dream, showed grotesque, alien-like animals emerging from clouds and plants, and hallucinatory pagodas blooming across forests and mountain ranges. The images proved that deep learning need not be entirely inscrutable; they revealed that the algorithms home in on familiar visual features like a bird’s beak or feathers. But the images also hinted at how different deep learning is from human perception, in that it might make something out of an artifact that we would know to ignore. Google researchers noted that when its algorithm generated images of a dumbbell, it also generated a human arm holding it. The machine had concluded that an arm was part of the thing. Further progress has been made using ideas borrowed from neuroscience and cognitive science. A team led by Jeff Clune, an assistant professor at the University of Wyoming, has employed the AI equivalent of optical illusions to test deep neural networks. In 2015, Clune’s group showed how certain images could fool such a network into perceiving things that aren’t there, because the images exploit the low-level patterns the system searches for. One of Clune’s collaborators, Jason Yosinski, also built a tool that acts like a probe stuck into a brain. His tool targets any neuron in the middle of the network and searches for the image that activates it the most. The images that turn up are abstract (imagine an impressionistic take on a flamingo or a school bus), highlighting the mysterious nature of the machine’s perceptual abilities. This early artificial neural network, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo, New York, circa 1960, processed inputs from light sensors. Ferriss was inspired to run Cornell's artificial neural network through Deep Dream, producing the images above and below. We need more than a glimpse of AI’s thinking, however, and there is no easy solution. It is the interplay of calculations inside a deep neural network that is crucial to higher-level pattern recognition and complex decision-making, but those calculations are a quagmire of mathematical functions and variables. “If you had a very small neural network, you might be able to understand it,” Jaakkola says. “But once it becomes very large, and it has thousands of units per layer and maybe hundreds of layers, then it becomes quite un-understandable.” In the office next to Jaakkola is Regina Barzilay, an MIT professor who is determined to apply machine learning to medicine. She was diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of years ago, at age 43. The diagnosis was shocking in itself, but Barzilay was also dismayed that cutting-edge statistical and machine-learning methods were not being used to help with oncological research or to guide patient treatment. She says AI has huge potential to revolutionize medicine, but realizing that potential will mean going beyond just medical records. She envisions using more of the raw data that she says is currently underutilized: “imaging data, pathology data, all this information.” How well can we get along with machines that are unpredictable and inscrutable? After she finished cancer treatment last year, Barzilay and her students began working with doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital to develop a system capable of mining pathology reports to identify patients with specific clinical characteristics that researchers might want to study. However, Barzilay understood that the system would need to explain its reasoning. So, together with Jaakkola and a student, she added a step: the system extracts and highlights snippets of text that are representative of a pattern it has discovered. Barzilay and her students are also developing a deep-learning algorithm capable of finding early signs of breast cancer in mammogram images, and they aim to give this system some ability to explain its reasoning, too. “You really need to have a loop where the machine and the human collaborate,” -Barzilay says. The U.S. military is pouring billions into projects that will use machine learning to pilot vehicles and aircraft, identify targets, and help analysts sift through huge piles of intelligence data. Here more than anywhere else, even more than in medicine, there is little room for algorithmic mystery, and the Department of Defense has identified explainability as a key stumbling block.

Quantum Computing Now Has a Powerful Search Tool David Gunning, a program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is overseeing the aptly named Explainable Artificial Intelligence program. A silver-haired veteran of the agency who previously oversaw the DARPA project that eventually led to the creation of Siri, Gunning says automation is creeping into countless areas of the military. Intelligence analysts are testing machine learning as a way of identifying patterns in vast amounts of surveillance data. Many autonomous ground vehicles and aircraft are being developed and tested. But soldiers probably won’t feel comfortable in a robotic tank that doesn’t explain itself to them, and analysts will be reluctant to act on information without some reasoning. “It’s often the nature of these machine-learning systems that they produce a lot of false alarms, so an intel analyst really needs extra help to understand why a recommendation was made,” Gunning says. This March, DARPA chose 13 projects from academia and industry for funding under Gunning’s program. Some of them could build on work led by Carlos Guestrin, a professor at the University of Washington. He and his colleagues have developed a way for machine-learning systems to provide a rationale for their outputs. Essentially, under this method a computer automatically finds a few examples from a data set and serves them up in a short explanation. A system designed to classify an e-mail message as coming from a terrorist, for example, might use many millions of messages in its training and decision-making. But using the Washington team’s approach, it could highlight certain keywords found in a message. Guestrin’s group has also devised ways for image recognition systems to hint at their reasoning by highlighting the parts of an image that were most significant. One drawback to this approach and others like it, such as Barzilay’s, is that the explanations provided will always be simplified, meaning some vital information may be lost along the way. “We haven’t achieved the whole dream, which is where AI has a conversation with you, and it is able to explain,” says Guestrin. “We’re a long way from having truly interpretable AI.” It doesn’t have to be a high-stakes situation like cancer diagnosis or military maneuvers for this to become an issue. Knowing AI’s reasoning is also going to be crucial if the technology is to become a common and useful part of our daily lives. Tom Gruber, who leads the Siri team at Apple, says explainability is a key consideration for his team as it tries to make Siri a smarter and more capable virtual assistant. Gruber wouldn’t discuss specific plans for Siri’s future, but it’s easy to imagine that if you receive a restaurant recommendation from Siri, you’ll want to know what the reasoning was. Ruslan Salakhutdinov, director of AI research at Apple and an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University, sees explainability as the core of the evolving relationship between humans and intelligent machines. “It’s going to introduce trust,” he says. Read Next AI’s Language Problem Machines that truly understand language would be incredibly useful. But we don’t know how to build them. Just as many aspects of human behavior are impossible to explain in detail, perhaps it won’t be possible for AI to explain everything it does. “Even if somebody can give you a reasonable-sounding explanation [for his or her actions], it probably is incomplete, and the same could very well be true for AI,” says Clune, of the University of Wyoming. “It might just be part of the nature of intelligence that only part of it is exposed to rational explanation. Some of it is just instinctual, or subconscious, or inscrutable.” If that’s so, then at some stage we may have to simply trust AI’s judgment or do without using it. Likewise, that judgment will have to incorporate social intelligence. Just as society is built upon a contract of expected behavior, we will need to design AI systems to respect and fit with our social norms. If we are to create robot tanks and other killing machines, it is important that their decision-making be consistent with our ethical judgments. To probe these metaphysical concepts, I went to Tufts University to meet with Daniel Dennett, a renowned philosopher and cognitive scientist who studies consciousness and the mind. A chapter of Dennett’s latest book, From Bacteria to Bach and Back, an encyclopedic treatise on consciousness, suggests that a natural part of the evolution of intelligence itself is the creation of systems capable of performing tasks their creators do not know how to do. “The question is, what accommodations do we have to make to do this wisely—what standards do we demand of them, and of ourselves?” he tells me in his cluttered office on the university’s idyllic campus. He also has a word of warning about the quest for explainability. “I think by all means if we’re going to use these things and rely on them, then let’s get as firm a grip on how and why they’re giving us the answers as possible,” he says. But since there may be no perfect answer, we should be as cautious of AI explanations as we are of each other’s—no matter how clever a machine seems. “If it can’t do better than us at explaining what it’s doing,” he says, “then don’t trust it.” Weren't able to make it to EmTech Digital?

In January, the US Department of Labor filed a lawsuit against Alphabet subsidiary Google to force the company to provide information on payments to employees in order to maintain the company's federal contracts. “Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation,” Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs Acting Director Thomas Dowd said in a statement at the time the suit was filed. “Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation.” In San Francisco court on Friday, the Guardian reports that government lawyers were unfurling their case: They allege "systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," as Department of Labor regional director Janette Wipper testified. “The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters,” a department spokeswoman told the Guardian. “The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry." Not so, the company claims. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap," Google told the Guardian when asked for comment. "Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.” An attorney for Google, Lisa Barnett Sween, called the request a “fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance to the compliance review,” according to the Guardian. Lawyers for the Department of Labor want the court to cancel any Google contracts with the federal government and block future contracts unless the company complies with the audit.

We're constantly Fake reviews on the Play Store, or any other online marketplace, are not new at all. But over the years, Google has stayed ahead of the curve with improved fraud and spam detection. But in the past few weeks, the amount of obviously fake reviews has skyrocketed. The reviews seem mostly targeted at popular apps, especially from Google - including Hangouts, Gmail, and Chrome. Many of them talk about each app as if it were a game - mentioning power-ups, Poker, and Bingo. Last time I checked, Hangouts didn't have a Poker game built-in. App developers paying for positive reviews is a somewhat common practice, but Google doesn't have a reason to do this. So why is it happening? One possible answer is that by reviewing multiple popular apps, each Google account would be less likely to be flagged by the company's spam filters. Many reviews are harder to distinguish from real ones, by simply saying "Good" or "Great." Here are a few examples from the Chrome listing (found below a review mentioning Bingo): We reached out to Google about a week ago about this problem, but we did not receive a response. At this point, it's hard to imagine Google isn't aware of the problem - but it may be difficult to fix.

Post your comment Ricky 11 April 2017 Google Rumors Android Misc This comes with some half-good news. Google Home has officially (but indirectly) been confirmed to gain the ability to manage multiple accounts for others who you share a household with. In its most recent app update, a message appears in the apps Discover tab. Unfortunately, there is no such feature available yet, so someone at Google must have made a mistake. Google Home is a smart assistant that can help you with the weather, your commute, and help you to control some of your smart home appliances. However, the biggest flaw is that a single Google Home cant manage multiple accounts. The most straightforward way of implementing this would be to introduce some voice-recognition that would differentiate who is speaking and provide that persons relevant information. While Google sorts out the whole multi-users deal, in the meantime you can summon Google Assistant from your Android phone, and it has your own account.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

VAVAMk_2 We wouldn't be giving him the warm welcome to AP if we weren't hard on him ;) dcdttu "...couldn't care less" abc Any writer whose first post on this site is criticism of Google (especially the Pixel), gets my support! A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

Google Assistant's new shopping list is live, here's how it works Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 7:00pm PDTApr 10, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 61 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares131 Applications Google News When Google Assistant was first introduced, you could ask it to add items to your personal shopping list. This would create a note called 'Google Assistant shopping list' in Google Keep, and you could easily manage your list from the Keep app (or web app). It makes sense that your shopping list would be in the same app as your notes, right? Apparently not to Google, because two days ago, a support article was updated to say the shopping list is moving out of Keep. Why? Because the new list ties into Google Express, so you can order what you need in fewer steps. That doesn't make the change any less stupid, but that's the reason.    When you ask Assistant to add something to your list, it is now added to the Google Express shopping list. You can actually have multiple shopping lists, and set any of them as the default. You can also share lists with other Google accounts, and they can easily add or remove items (which was a bit buggy with Keep lists). You might notice that some items (like the Vitamin Water in the above screenshot) have a tiny umbrella icon. When you tap it, it will link you to the product on Google Express. I guess that's useful? But there are some major problems with this implementation too. Unless you have the Google Express app installed, your shopping list is opened in a Chrome Custom Tab. Google could have easily added this to the Google app, but they didn't. One of my favorite aspects of the Keep list was being able to check items off with my watch (through the Android Wear Keep app). Even if you have the Express app installed, there's no way to access the list from Android Wear. In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep. So in summary, the new shopping list implementation is two steps forward, one step back. Feel free to vent your frustration in the comments below.

Stupid move. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's my main problem with this. I used the shopping list for non-online purchases, while this clearly oriented for online shopping. Todd Johnson Agreed... So I can go grocery shopping and tick stuff off! Teja Common, Its just an option. You can ignore it completely but removing keep integration is something we need to worry about. javier rodriguez I vow here and now to Never purchase an item from Google Express... Unless they add YouTube red to the stupid yearly charge. whispy_snippet Never even heard of Google Express because it's not actually available in Australia. So now my Google Assistant shopping list in Keep has been gimped because... no reason at all. Todd Johnson That's what I thought when I was reading this article... What the F@&% is Google Express, look it up and yeah good work Google, change a feature that people use to something that people don't use... They are releasing the Google Home in the UK and it doesn't look like Google Express is available there? So what, UK users won't be able to use the feature? I bought a Google Home about 1.5weeks ago and am waiting for it to arrive. Yay! Upon reading the below comments, I suppose we could name a list as Coles list or Woolies List... But that is such a stupid work around! EDIT: And it's a monthly subscription!!!! "Google Express membership is $10/month or $95/year after your trial." - https://www.google.com/express/u/0/about MatchstickMan Great, now my shopping list isn't easily accessible by the Keep widget on one of my home screens and I now have to open Home, click the sidebar menu, then select shopping list and wait for the Chrome tab to load up! Thanks, Google! rh I just tell Google to remind me next ti e I'm at a Walmart to get bread coffee razors and if I think of other stuff I tell Google again to remind me to get shaving cream ,surgery and milk, then when I pull into said parking lot I get a text reminder of what I need,..boom done and done Hayden Pearce > "and if I think of other stuff I tell Google again to remind me to get shaving cream ,surgery and milk" "OK, Google. Remind me to get surgery." Teja "Okay Google, show me my shopping list" should work though. Anyways I also prefer Keep integration as the list can be a shared list. nside1 The Google app (Google search box widget) still allows me to add items to my Google keep shopping list, will that change? Corbin Davenport No idea. Nicolas Finn From the article: "In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep." David Hyman Hopefully this evolves quickly into something great. Adding a widget and launcher shortcuts should make getting there very easy. And if this allows me to better manage the items on my list I'm all in. I really want to be able to ask is peanut butter on my list and have assistant say "yes" instead of just reading me my entire list Grey So "hope all the lost functionality is restored"? dylan-m Of course, not living in the United States, I don't have the Google Express app. (Not that most people do anyway). So I get the dumb website instead. First thing I notice is you can add other lists. Interesting. And yet if I say "add foo to my to do list" it adds to a new list in Google Keep anyway. So apparently this feature only applies to lists with names like "shopping list." Brilliant, Google. Top notch interface design, as ever. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard Google services killed the first born children of the Google Assistant team. That's why they don't like integrating with Google services. It's personal for them. Booyabobby I rather the list stay on Keep. supersanborn The original clunky approach of being unable to use an existing keep shopping lift has been made clunkier. Guess I'll keep not using this feature. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I used Keep because it was really useful for grocery shopping in the usual supermarket. Grey Nope you have to buy from Google Express. Also, not telling you what Google Express is. newtonfb God dammit. I'm going to get slammed with messages tomorrow from friends and family asking what's going on and why did they change it....And I have no answer for them. I really do hate Google when they do shit like this. Already give us the option to keep using Keep. bozzykid I guess Google is really desperate to push Google Express that they don't care how terrible it makes Google Assistant. Great job Google! Nick I never understood why it was in keep in the first place so this makes more sense. pfmiller Because Keep is meant for keeping notes and lists. Seems pretty obvious to me. Who on Earth would think to go to the Google Home app for their shopping list? Paul_Werner Meh, I'll stick to Flipp for my shopping list/coupons/grocery store maps Hypnotoad I don't think I've been this pissed with Google since Allo... What the hell!? I don't want to use Google Express, I never signed up for it and I don't have the app, please put my shopping list back in Google keep!!! I can add to my keep shopping list via Google now, but not the assistant, what the hell is wrong with this!? Sir_Brizz Two steps sideways, two steps back. Seth Merritt Should be one step forward, two steps back. m-p{3} If I can't use Google Keep to manage that list on a desktop and more importantly make it shared with a relative living in the same HOME, then Google fucked up. ngwoo I love it when something called an "assistant" stops providing assistance. This is probably the stupidest change Google ever made - at least let us choose which list to use. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Being an Android Site you guys should be used to Google going 2 steps forward and 1 step back. It's called Job Security. Marty McWong Just as an aside, are many Nexus 5X/6P owners are still waiting for Assistant to roll out? I've yet to receive it, and if it makes a difference I'm on 7.1.2 (via the beta), no root and with an apparently up to date (7.6.08...) Play Store... Grey Check your settings Grey "Can't we just add Google Express support to Keep?" "You're fired." CoffeeZombie I like Keep. I have a shared shopping list on Keep with my wife. We can both add things to it and take things off that we've bought. We both have access to it at the store. I could use it from my watch while at the store, which was always nice. Google Now knew how to add items to this shared list, too. It was super convenient. "Oh, we're out of milk! Okay, Google, add milk to my shopping list." Done! Then Assistant came. I tried adding an item to the shopping list...and it created a new Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. WTF? I already have a shopping list, that's what I want to use. So, basically, I guess this doesn't affect me at this point because I've already had my nice, voice-activated shopping list taken away from me. I'll just stick with manually adding things in Keep and remembering back in 2004 when Google was cool... Abhimanyu Seth Since I found wunderlist, never looked at another app for shopping lists! Jose Romero More renewed focus on Google Express. This gives me a little bit more hope that Google might one day make a "Google Prime" that at least includes Google Express, Google Movies, and Google Music in the yearly subscription cost. Wynnded Keep app just got an update, lol. James Briano "OK, Google, add an iPhone to my shopping list." Portzblitz You CAN'T use Google Express in about 5,292 US cities, sooo.. Is the wisdom of this intentionally hidden from us, or does this really, truly do no one- including Google- any good? b_boogey_xl *rabble rabble rabble* this one change ruins everything. how will I go on with life, my shopping list is ruined… *rabble rabble rabble* 🙄 disqus_3Gy5bmHRAv Yet another example of Google's haphazard policies towards apps. Android has become a complete frustration. The apps work differently on different devices, an app can be killed off at any minute based on a whim and important apps do not get enough attention because of Google's philosophy: Try everything, master nothing. Teja I need an option to add tasks to a to do list in keep through Google Assistant. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher R.I.P. shopping with my watch :-( http://i.imgur.com/RuHrQnK.jpg There is still a way, much more complicated: 1. Make sure NOT to install Google Express 2. Open shopping list on the phone 3. Select all → Copy 4. Open Google Keep 5. Create new list 6. Paste 7. Remove extra line spacing → Now you can still use your watch in the store. Thank you Google. DragoCubed It makes total sense for a shopping list to be in keep. Google is trying to make itself a mess.

An ongoing investigation into Google’s payment practices was revealed during a court hearing, for a lawsuit the DoL filed against the search giant after it resisted calls to provide salary documentation to the government. During the hearing, Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testified that the department “found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across [Google’s] entire workforce”. This was backed up by comments from the DoL’s regional solicitor Janet Herold, who told the Guardian: “The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” Herold went on to say: “The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.” That final point gives an indication of just how severe these allegations are, given that the tech industry is in a rather sorry state when it comes to gender equality. Uber has been at the centre of multiple claims of systemic sexism over the past few months, while startup culture in Silicon Valley is allegedly rife with sexual discrimination. Google has denied the accusations, taking to Twitter to insist that it has “closed the gender pay gap globally”. Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay. All employers can take steps to eliminate the gender and race pay gaps, today → https://t.co/KTuGTJMV16 pic.twitter.com/rBciSK21uF — Google (@Google) April 4, 2017 The lawsuit against Google came after the company refused to hand over data relating to the job and salary history of its employees, claiming that the requests were “overbroad” and violated employee privacy.   The DoL has asked the court to block any future business between Google and the government if it continues to resist an audit of employees’ salaries.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Google combats fake news with ‘Fact Check’ results in search and news Ian Paul 11 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Google is ready to roll out its fact check label to Google News editions worldwide after introducing the feature in October for the United States and the UK. The label will also appear in searches in all languages that Google supports. When you’re searching for a topic that’s been answered by a source using the fact check label, Google’s results page will include a snippet with three components: information about the claim being made, who made the claim, and whether that claim is true, false, or somewhere in between. It may also appear in a Google News cluster with the term “Fact check” before the headline. Google warns that the fact check label won’t appear for every possible conspiracy or crazy news story you can think of. A search for “the Earth is flat,” for example, did not have surface any fact check labels at this writing. Arguably it shouldn’t as the claim is preposterous and doesn’t merit serious consideration, anyway. For a site to earn the fact check label, it must include Schema.org’s ClaimReview markup in their HTML. The story behind the story: The problem, however, is that flat earthers and other conspiracy theorists may be able to game Google’s new fact check label, at least in the short term. If all that’s required is proper HTML markup, a site could try to get a fact check label for a false story. However, Google is willing to use its power as the world’s most popular search engine to counteract any shenanigans. The company’s support pages say that if a site does not meet Google’s standards for fact checking the search engine may ignore the publisher’s markup or remove the site from Google News. Another situation that users may confront is when two fact-check labels offer different conclusions. Google says this is possible under its new scheme. “There may be search result pages where different publishers checked the same claim and reached different conclusions,” Google said in a blog post. “We think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.” Related Tags:  Share: Comments Related Posts Random Posts Router Group Test Ins and outs of upgrading your iMac Gusto Orangutans go ape for Apple iPads Apple in-fighting: Mansfield agreed to two more years at Apple after Forstall fired Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 11 April 2017 | MYT 9:00 AM Google adds fact check to global search results Google has worked with 115 fact-checking groups worldwide for the initiative, which began last year. — AFP Relaxnews Google is adding a fact-checking tag to search results globally, its latest initiative to help curb the spread of misinformation and "fake news," the company said. The new tags, to be used in all languages for users worldwide, will use third-party fact-checkers to indicate whether news items are true, false or somewhere in-between. "For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page," Google said in a blog post. "The snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim." The information won't be available for every search result, and there may be conflicting conclusions in some cases, Google said in the blog post, from researcher Cong Yu and Justin Kosslyn of Google's sister company Jigsaw. "These fact checks are not Google's and are presented so people can make more informed judgments," it said. "Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it's still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree." Google has worked with 115 fact-checking groups worldwide for the initiative, which began last year. The move came a day after Facebook added a new tool in news feeds to help users determine whether shared stories are real or bogus. Fake news became a serious issue in last year's US election campaign, when clearly fraudulent stories circulated on social media, potentially swaying some voters. Concerns have been raised since then about hoaxes and misinformation affecting elections in Europe this year, with investigations showing how "click farms" generate revenue from online advertising using made-up news stories. The moves by both firms aim to change the way news is ranked, diminishing the importance of how often a particular story is shared or clicked on. —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Uber says its self-driving technology differs from Waymo’s Drones barred over US military bases due to security risks: agency Banks scramble to fix old systems as IT ‘cowboys’ ride into sunset Grab uses local data to generate traffic solutions in Malaysia Flipkart raises US$1.4bil in high stakes battle with Amazon Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Others Also Read Abundant opportunities await in oil palm sector Driver trapped in garbage truck dangles over third-floor railing Walker ends Evans' bid for maiden Crucible appearance advertisement Latest News Printed titanium parts expected to save millions in Boeing Dreamliner costs Foxconn could bid up to US$27bil for Toshiba's chip business: Bloomberg Cyberattack on Union Bank of India similar to Bangladesh heist: WSJ France's Macron says would step up security demands on tech firms Battle of billionaires as Son set to clash with Bezos in India Most Viewed in Tech Battle of billionaires as Son set to clash with Bezos in India Qualcomm claims Apple made threats and lied to regulators Artificial intelligence to put an end to failed selfies Flipkart raises US$1.4bil in high stakes battle with Amazon BMW, Ford win UK funds for driverless, low-carbon vehicles The Samsung Galaxy S: The evolution year by year LeEco abandons US$2bil Vizio deal, citing ‘Chinese policy factor’ Symantec attributes 40 cyberattacks to CIA-linked hacking tools Facebook's Sandberg says number of monthly advertisers tops five million Cyberattack on Union Bank of India similar to Bangladesh heist: WSJ Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Amazon has a series of apps that compete with Office 365 and G Suite, but they currently aren’t packaged and sold as a collective portfolio. Here’s how Amazon could become a major player in business software. Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 11 April, 2017 04:23 - - - - print email Comments Microsoft has for decades owned the intersection of collaboration, productivity and communication. However, as these services shifted to the cloud, it opened pathways for greater competition and flexibility in how organizations deployed applications for their workforce. Through G Suite, Google has stretched its resources and refined its family of apps for enterprise. The market is far from locked up, however, and analysts see at least some room for new players to emerge to challenge Google and Microsoft. Could Amazon be the dark horse of enterprise collaboration? The company has a dominating position in cloud-based infrastructure, but its moves in the application market, albeit reserved, have yet to deliver similar impact. But what if it decides to focus on the collaboration market? [ Related: 6 IT leaders share tips to drive collaboration ] Gauging Amazon’s potential impact “[Amazon] could have an impact if they get serious about it, but I have not seen many signs of that happening,” says Jeffrey Mann, research vice president at Gartner. “WorkMail and WorkDocs have been around for a couple years with nothing really compelling about them, and very little uptake. Chime is a more recent addition, but they are still pretty far from having a complete suite or much to differentiate their offerings.” Amazon will disrupt whichever space it decides to jump into, but Amazon is unlikely to go head to head with Microsoft’s Office 365 or Google’s G Suite, according to Raul Castanon-Martinez, senior analyst at 451 Research. “The lines are blurring between business communications and enterprise collaboration and productivity -- and their convergence is defining a new segment which some vendors are calling ‘collaborative communications’ or ‘workflow communications,’” he says. “Amazon, Google and Microsoft are each approaching the market from different angles. Google and Microsoft are strong contenders when it comes to productivity tools, while Amazon is focusing on business communications and team meetings. All three overlap with it comes to collaboration.” [ Related: G Suite vs. Office 365 cloud collaboration battle heats up ] Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw, says Amazon has been smart to focus on areas that are being over or underserved in the market. Chime, for example, is “much less feature-packed than some of the alternatives, but performs the key functions of a web conferencing solution much better than the competition, notably WebEx,” he says. Web conferencing is easier to displace than a productivity suite as comprehensive as Office 365 or G Suite, he adds. “I think Amazon would struggle if it tried to take on Microsoft and Google in the core productivity space, and it’s better off continuing to nibble at the edges in areas where those companies are weak.” Amazon would face challenges vs. Microsoft and Google If Amazon decide to package a suite of services to compete with Microsoft and Google, it would encounter significant challenges and put a spotlight on every missing piece in its app portfolio. “The challenge is how much are they going to be able to offer that’s going to differentiate and how much are they going to be able to offer that’s going to at least meet the minimum bar of what people are expecting in communication and collaboration portfolios,” says TJ Keitt, senior analyst, Forrester. “Enterprise cloud office has been a very hard market to crack,” Mann says. “Big companies like Novell, Oracle, Cisco and IBM have failed. Apple has stayed away from it. I can understand why they are holding back.” [ Battle of the clouds: Amazon Web Services vs. Microsoft Azure vs. Google Cloud Platform ] Amazon would also be a late entrant without a compelling offering, according to Mann. The company would also have to contend without an ecosystem to extend or support their system and a lack of awareness that Amazon is even in the market, he says. “This is a volume-driven market. Without millions of seats, it will be hard to compete.” The inherent power of incumbency, particularly from entrenched providers like Microsoft, would be Amazon’s biggest challenge, according to Dawson. “Companies’ reliance on the Office suite and the associated back-end services like Exchange are huge barriers to switching, as Google has discovered over the years,” he says. “Google has slowly eroded some of that resistance over time, and has done particularly well among smaller companies with less legacy infrastructure, but it’s still an uphill battle. So for a company like Amazon, with very little track record in end user productivity software, it’ll be a long road.” AWS could be Amazon’s wild card Amazon has at least one powerful tool, Amazon Web Services, that could support the company’s pursuit of cloud-based apps for work, but analysts don’t believe that underlying infrastructure will be enough on its own to overcome areas where it still lacks core competencies. If Amazon’s strategy is to position AWS as a gateway to a range of services, the company will have to appeal directly to the needs of its existing AWS customers and it appears many of those organizations needs are already being met elsewhere, according to Keitt. [ Download the State of the CIO 2017 research report ] “Many companies do already have a relationship with Amazon for AWS, and that may help with relationships and trust, but providing end user software is very different from supplying IT departments with cloud services, and that’s going to be a tough transition for Amazon,” Dawson says. “Yes, AWS underpins these newer services and that may make some integration work easier, but it’s far from the most important facet or issue of a migration like this.” Amazon is slowly moving up the stack, but its key strength remains in AWS and the synergies created when enterprise apps are run on the cloud, according to Castanon-Martinez. “Running a critical collaboration tool on AWS makes sense give its global reach and extensive communications infrastructure already in place,” he says. AWS also has a “well-earned reputation for reliability and scalability,” which will be key benefits for any services Amazon decides to launch. Areas where Amazon can compete Amazon has yet to package its apps for end users into a comprehensive suite, but the company is already in the market with a range of apps including WorkDocs, WorkMail, WorkSpaces, Chime, QuickSight and AppStream. “To a certain extent the company is already competing although their focus is clearly on team collaboration and not so much on personal productivity,” Castanon-Martinez says. “Amazon typically competes on price and scale so that is something we can expect by default, but the market is moving away from feature parity,” he says. Amazon could also capitalize on the unnecessary complexity of Office 365 and G Suite with a product portfolio that doesn’t overlap and create confusion for customers. “Both Google and Microsoft need to streamline their enterprise collaboration, productivity and communications tools while Amazon is starting fresh,” Castanon-Martinez says. Mann says he would advise Amazon to position its apps as an opportunistic offering with low expectations. “This is a demanding market with mature products, so it will be hard to compete on a head-to-head basis,” he says. “Amazon could potentially compete on price, if they were willing to invest massive amounts and suffer losses for several years before building up enough volume.” While Microsoft and Google have weak spots in their suites, it’s not clear what capabilities Amazon can develop that would differentiate it from these widely used services that have become standard in many businesses. “That’s the overarching question and to this point they haven’t unveiled anything, and best I can tell they haven’t made too many acquisitions that would say that’s an area they’re going to play in,” Keitt says. “Unless you are offering something or have figured out a part of the market that is looking for something different and unachievable by the existing players in the marketplace it’s going to be difficult for your business to really make huge waves,” he says. “You never really win in business by trying to compete on someone else’s core competency.” Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter!

Photo: Samuel C. Rutherford/Tom's GuideMore Photo: Samuel C. Rutherford/Tom's Guide According to a report from Korean outlet ETNews, Google is investing heavily in LG Display Co. in order to secure access to flexible OLED screens for its next smartphone. That means that the Google Pixel 2 could pack a curved display, adding some flair to the original's somewhat plain design. A curved screen would bring the Pixel 2 up to speed with Samsung's stunning new Galaxy S8, which features an edge-to-edge Infinity display that forgoes a physical home button in favor of a virtual one. Most iPhone 8 rumors point to a curved display on Apple's next flagship as well. MORE: 7 Reasons Not to Get a Galaxy S8 Right Now However, the deal between Google and LG Display hasn't been finalized, so it's worth taking this one with a grain of salt. The Google Pixel is currently our favorite overall Android phone, thanks to its excellent camera, strong battery life and smart Google Assistant integration. According to the Google Pixel 2 rumors we've heard so far, Google's next flagship could feature a waterproof design and improved cameras. The next Pixel likely won't release until fall, but we could see a reveal well before then. Google's annual I/O developer conference kicks off next month on May 17, and could give us our first glimpse at what the company's smartphone team is cooking up.

However it seems that Google wants to take advantage of that and will now be showing users “Similar Items” which are basically shopping links. In an announcement on Google’s blog, “Image Search recently launched “Similar items” on mobile web and the Android Search app. The “Similar items” feature is designed to help users find products they love in photos that inspire them on Google Image Search. Using machine vision technology, the Similar items feature identifies products in lifestyle images and displays matching products to the user.” Google has also announced that they will be expanding the search to cover more categories in the next few months. As you can see in the screenshot above, the Similar Items will be placed below each of the images in the search results, with the items being pretty close to what is being shown in the images. This means that if you like a certain look and are wondering where to get it, Google’s Image Search plans to take some of the guess work out of that. The changes should already be live so check it out if you haven’t done so already. Filed in General. Read more about Google.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha.

Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

[Update: Google responds] Google still hasn't solved the Play Store's fake review epidemic Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 1:57pm PDTApr 10, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares61 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/10 4:12pm PDT A Google spokesperson reached out to us, and provided the following statement: "We're aware of the recent spammy reviews on Google Play and have taken action to remove them. We're constantly Fake reviews on the Play Store, or any other online marketplace, are not new at all. But over the years, Google has stayed ahead of the curve with improved fraud and spam detection. But in the past few weeks, the amount of obviously fake reviews has skyrocketed. The reviews seem mostly targeted at popular apps, especially from Google - including Hangouts, Gmail, and Chrome. Many of them talk about each app as if it were a game - mentioning power-ups, Poker, and Bingo. Last time I checked, Hangouts didn't have a Poker game built-in. App developers paying for positive reviews is a somewhat common practice, but Google doesn't have a reason to do this. So why is it happening? One possible answer is that by reviewing multiple popular apps, each Google account would be less likely to be flagged by the company's spam filters. Many reviews are harder to distinguish from real ones, by simply saying "Good" or "Great." Here are a few examples from the Chrome listing (found below a review mentioning Bingo): We reached out to Google about a week ago about this problem, but we did not receive a response. At this point, it's hard to imagine Google isn't aware of the problem - but it may be difficult to fix. Update 1: 2017/04/10 4:12pm PDT A Google spokesperson reached out to us, and provided the following statement: "We're aware of the recent spammy reviews on Google Play and have taken action to remove them.

Google quits Facebook’s Free Basics; ends partnership in Zambia After Google, Facebook debuts live location sharing on Messenger Facebook’s Audience Network gearing to take on Google AdSense Home » Facebook, Fact Check, Fake News, Google, Internet Google rolls out Fact Check tag across search and news By Cyril Sam on April 7, 2017 April 7, 2017 by Cyril Sam 013 Google introduced Fact Check tag across its search and news products globally across all languages Friday, the company announced in a blog. Google first introduced the Fact Check tag across US and UK in October last year. This is a big day for fact-checkers on the Internet. Hours before Google made its announcement, Facebook made public plans of paying fact-checkers. “For the first time, when you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result containing fact checks for one or more public claims, you will see that information clearly on the search results page,” the company wrote on its blog. How is Google Fact Check tag different from Facebook’s disputed tag Unlike Facebook, which has a hands-off approach to tackling misinformation and fake news, Google’s Fact Check tag is determined algorithmically. Facebook crowdsources fact checking by partnering with third party fact-checkers and lays the onus of spotting and reporting misinformation and fake news on users on the platform. Google, on the other hand, is encouraging publishers to use schema.org ClaimReview markup elements on their webpages and asks them to adhere to a set of criteria. The search company claims that sites do not follow the criteria for ClaimReview markup will be removed from Google News. Google claims it is currently working with 115 fact-checking organizations to source fact check data. Facebook, on the other hand, works with a handful fact-checking organizations in the US, France, and Germany. News organizations can now, theoretically, use Google’s new feature to fact-check each other or give different verdicts on the veracity of the same article. Advertisement How Google determines a fact check The publisher of the fact check must be a trusted source of information (determined by an algorithm) The content must clearly tell: Which claims are being checked Conclusions about the claims How conclusions were reached Citations and primary sources of information Fake news on the Internet In the last two years, fake news has turned into a controversial subject on the Internet. After Donald Trump’s election as the US president, it is now being seen as a threat to democracy across the globe. According to Prashant Singh, VP Product, of Paytm: Blogging and self-publishing started a trend which was fuelled by the advent of social web and smartphone. Instead of traversing the Internet from webpage to webpage, people started traversing from one person to another. Behavior like Back-linking and Bookmarking got replaced with Follow, Subscribe, Share, Rate and Like. Eyeballs shifted to Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. Distribution and creation of content became democratized and more importantly, decentralized. The genie was out of the bottle. Decentralized content creation means a decentralized and diffused responsibility of ensuring authenticity. The stage was set for the emergence of Fake News. Speaking at a Medianama event earlier this year, Nasr Ul Hadi, ICFJ Knight Fellow, suggested: “There will not be a single solution, there will be a portfolio of solutions speaking to multiple sources of misinformation.” Google and Facebook’s move is in that direction, where each platform is trying to address the issue with their own set of approaches and tools. *** Read our coverage of the fake news issue here: What is fake news?

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

VAVAMk_2 We wouldn't be giving him the warm welcome to AP if we weren't hard on him ;) dcdttu "...couldn't care less" abc Any writer whose first post on this site is criticism of Google (especially the Pixel), gets my support! A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

Creative Commons Zero In part one of this series, What Is Kubernetes?, and in part two, Why Choose Kubernetes to Manage Containerized Applications?, we learned what Kubernetes does, its architecture, and how it compares to similar container orchestrators. Now we'll learn how Kubernetes was descended from the secret Google Borg project. The Borg Heritage Kubernetes is distinguished from similar container orchestration systems, such as Apache Mesos and Google Swarm, by its Google heritage. Kubernetes was inspired by Borg, the very advanced internal datacenter management system used by Google for a decade. Nearly all of Google's services run in containers, both internal and external services such as Gmail, Google search, Google Maps, MapReduce, Google File System, and Google Compute Engine. Think of Borg as the giant brain that manages Google's datacenters as a single pool of resources to fuel Google's giant fleet of services, and manages them so efficiently it saves Google the cost of an entire datacenter. Google still owns Borg, and is building the next version, codenamed Omega, which is not nearly as cool a name as Borg. Kubernetes was founded as an open source project in 2014, and several of Borg's top contributors also work on Kubernetes. Google donated Kubernetes to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which is hosted at the Linux Foundation and supported by a number of big companies (including Google, Cisco, Docker, IBM, and Intel). The idea is to create a reference architecture for cloud technologies that anyone can use. Borg was a closely held secret until 2015, when Google published the Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg paper. This reveals a lot of fascinating details and bold claims such as "We are not sure where the ultimate scalability limit to Borg's centralized architecture will come from; so far, every time we have approached a limit, we've managed to eliminate it." fig-1.jpg Figure 1: How Borg has inspired current datacenter systems. Used with permission Kubernetes Lineage Figure 1 shows how Borg has inspired current datacenter systems, and the underlying technologies used in container runtimes today. Google contributed cgroups to the Linux kernel in 2007, which limits the resources used by collections of processes. cgroupsand Linux namespaces are at the heart of containers today, including Docker. Mesos was inspired by discussions with Google when Borg was still a secret. The Cloud Foundry Foundation embraces The Twelve-Factor Application principles. These principles provide guidance for building Web applications that scale easily, are deployed in the Cloud, and have automated build system. Borg and Kubernetes both address these principles. To sum up, the modern datacenter owes a lot to Google, and Kubernetes is built on over a decade of research and production use in one of the most demanding environments on Earth.

What this means is that your Google Play Store purchases can now be charged to your phone bill, so that you won’t have to deal with separate bills when it comes to all things related to your phone. Boost Mobile will be the latest carrier to be supported in the US. They join the likes of AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon which is pretty much all the major carriers, as well as US Cellular. We expect that over time there will be more carriers added to the list in the US, but for now there will be six that are currently supported. In addition to the US, Google Play Store carrier billing has also expanded its support to other carriers around the world. For our non-US readers, this includes Vodafone in Indonesia, Beeline for those living in Kazakhstan, Orange for our readers in Luxembourg, Telenor Pakistan, Telekom in Slovenia, and Vietnamobile and Viettel for Vietnam. While this is great for bill consolidation, it also comes in handy for those who prefer to avoid using their debit/credit cards, or for those who do not own one. Filed in Cellphones.

That information, supplied by the likes of PolitiFact and Snopes, will show up in cards with a ‘Fact Check’ tag when you use the company’s search engine or look up news. As the company noted in a blog post, “the snippet will display information on the claim, who made the claim, and the fact check of that particular claim.” Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE Google first added fact checks to search back in October 2016 for the US and UK and rolled it out to a few more countries in February. Today’s announcement sees the feature launching across the world. As before, the information isn’t verified directly by Google; instead, it allows anyone to get in on the action by using prescribed markup on their fact check pages. “Only publishers that are algorithmically determined to be an authoritative source of information will qualify for inclusion,” the company said. With that, Google joins Facebook in helping web users discern between bogus stories and truthful content. The company said it’s currently working with 115 fact-checking organizations to source verification data. Hopefully, we’ll see more initiatives like this to help prevent false information from spreading widely across the web.

ETNews is reporting that the search giant has expressed an interest in investing KRW 1 trillion (about $880 million) into the latter. Google is apparently looking to secure flexible OLED displays for its next Pixel smartphone. KRW 1 trillion is enough to produce one line of sixth generation small and medium-sized panels. Depending on contract details such as the supply conditions, the investment size could increase. LG Display is rumored to be seriously considering the proposal. Google seems to be intent on building a strategic relationship with the manufacturer. OLED displays are in short supply at the moment. Investing in the company would allow the US-based firm to get priority status, in addition to stabilizing supply and demand. Also See: Google Pixel 2 pops up on AOSP The original Pixel and Pixel XL had featured OLED displays. However, shipping was delayed considerably because of a lack of parts. The paucity of such panels is supposedly one of the main culprits behind the shortage. Interestingly enough, Google has in the past vaguely alluded that the so-called Pixel 2 will not suffer the same fate. When asked about what changes to expect, the brand stated that the biggest issue facing the current line of Pixels is that there aren’t enough units to meet demand. Joining hands with LG Display may be key to putting an end to this lack of supply. However, the next Pixel is expected to come out in the second half of the year. Given that talks are still being held between the two, it’s possible a curved OLED Pixel is still a long ways off.

I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

Google Assistant's shopping list is moving out of Keep and into the Home app on April 10 Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/08 6:07am PDTApr 8, 2017 129 Plus 1 on G+ 166 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares364 Applications Google News I love having the Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. It means that I can access it whenever I want on the phone and the web, add items to it, and share it with my fiancé while we're in the process of furnishing our apartment. It also means that we don't have to worry about using another app: everything we need is organized in Keep and so is our shopping list. But that's about to change soon, very soon, like this-Monday soon. A new notice is showing up for users when they open up their Google Assistant Shopping List in Keep telling them that changes are afoot. According to the support page, the shopping list is becoming an integral part of the Google Home app. This is where all the items you add from Google Assistant, Google Home (the device), and Google Express will end up. It will show up on the left slide-out menu of the Home app as "Shopping List." If you don't want your items to move anywhere, Google explains that you can still copy the note in Keep now to continue using it there. But any items you add via Assistant won't show up in it: the duplicate will become a manual entry list like any other list in Keep. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. They're nestled inside the main app and handled there. But Google already has a powerful list and note app, so why it decided to move away from it baffles me a little. Artem and Cody both seem to think that the use of Keep was a momentary hack and a more powerful solution was bound to be released at some point. I tend to disagree. There are still three questions left unanswered with this move. One is whether users without a Google Home (the device) and outside of the USA will see the Shopping List in the app's menu. So far, plenty of options from Assistant have been hidden from those who don't own a Home device, so would this be one of them? I'd like to think that it won't be the case, but who knows?! Two is whether users who don't have Google Express will have any way to access the list from the web. And three is how shared lists will be managed. Keep wasn't an elegant solution for couples and households with multiple users. Adding items with Assistant only worked for the person who created and shared the list, but others had to type them manually in Keep because adding with voice would send items to their own personal list. The support document says, "Your list will automatically be shared with anyone you shared your Keep list with. They can access their lists from the Google Home or Express app," which infers that multiple lists will be supported but doesn't say if users would be able to add items to someone else's list with a voice command. I guess it's only 2 days until we have answers to our questions so until then, maybe do the wise thing and duplicate your Keep shopping list... just in case.

Alex Louderback You're not funny, the joke is old Badouken You mean you don't like hearing the same joke 3 times on every article? Merf I chuckled yet a small part of me doesn't think it's that far fetched. Mace Moneta If it were that old, Google would stop doing it. bekifft I don't know, it's not funny but that's because it's scarily plausible. NoNotTellingYou Ugh, the power of Google is its ability to INTEGRATE. What they should do is add Keep in as a service so that you can easily continue using them as your shopping list. At least offer a choice like they do for playing music. navjot Ah it would suck if we can't continue using it in Keep. I like having all my notes there and I use the Google Assistant feature a lot. But I don't want to go to the Google Home app just to access this one list when all my other lists are in Google Keep (and easily available via the home screen widget). I'd probably just have to stop using the Google Assistant shopping list feature. Alan Burnstine G-d damn it. Best feature of assistant, and the only reason I cared about getting assistant on my smartwatch, and they go and break it before my watch even gets the upgrade. Timothy Chase Don't use Google Assistant that much. Talking to it in front of others seems weird, to them, to me. And it doesn't do that great a job figuring out what I am saying, so I don't use it that much when I am by myself. I like Keep on its own. I like the fact that my wife can email me the grocery list and I can paste it into Keep. I can move items around to reflect the layout of the store. I can check things off and they move down below the active list. And I don't have a bunch of smart appliances. I have my phone and a computer, and mostly use the phone as that is what I am able to take with me wherever I go. Not much need for Google Home. Plus I am not sure my wife will ever feel comfortable having something connected to the web listening to every word she says, so we might never get that device. ToasTd That's nice. XgudwilX If your phone & computer are connected to the web.. They're listening. Timothy Chase That is what I was thinking. Likewise, the camera on your computer can be turned on without your permission if software is hacked. Personally I think my wife may be overly anxious​. I mean, she doesn't have a cell phone. And of course I don't think Google is spying on me. They have better things to do. But is it possible for Google Home (the device) to be hacked? If it is connected to the internet and capable of receiving software updates over the web, then at least in principle it would seem to be vulnerable to being hacked. And if it is in every room then it will be there wherever you are. Personally, I think life is always a bit of a gamble and I might prefer to have it even with that risk. But it seems unlikely that my wife will be. Cecil Hardwood It may listen 24/7 but only sends what you say after it hears the wake word. This has been proven to be true over and over and over and over. Phoenix Google is like the friend you genuinely love but you know you can't trust Martin I would say Google is like the friend you really want to trust but you know soon or later he will stab you in the back ;) Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Steven Dino Windfeld This is exactly how I feel. Every time I incorporate something useful from Google, into my daily rutines and workflows, they break it apart / discontinue it / removes essential functionality. icethegreat LIke seriously, i'm getting to old for this shite. bdbplatano That's EXACTLY how I feel bekifft They're becoming more like Microsoft was in its day. Doesn't matter if you love them or not, you'll use them because they're the only real option, and they'll do what they want regardless because they don't have to care what anyone thinks. LondonLeedsFan And that went really well for Microsoft. Can't wait for Google Live tiles ;) Luke Applegate Are they prepping for multi-user support on Google Home? create812 As long as it gets better, I don't mind the change too much. But if they strip features, it'll be bad. Rob It already creates different lists in Keep from Assistant and Voice Search, which is stupid. Hope this move makes it better pfmiller I don't see this making it better, but that is ridiculous. How hard is it to just agree on one shopping list name and use it consistently? Firelight JEEZ! This is like one of THE most useful features of Home/Keep. I go through the pantry and literally say allowed to Home what I need. I head to the store and presto-change-o everything is on my phone and I check off what I get. It's seemless and if I think of something at work or in the car - using Google Assistant I add more. Is Google Assistant on the PHONE losing access to the Keep shopping list? bekifft "Aloud" is the homonym you were looking for there, but yes I agree entirely. And it's not clear yet how that's going to work. Doesn't seem like it belongs in the Home app. I use a third party app for this anyway, if you already regularly share a grocery list with someone there are far better ways to do it. Sicofante Care to mention a few of these "far better ways"? bekifft This is the one I use, haven't checked any others for a long time but it seems to work well, and my main requirement is cross platform support with iOS which it has: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en Firelight @bekifft in bird culture this is known as a Dick Move. (It was voice2text). Glad you use a solution you like. I like the solution I have (had?). Timothy Chase Good question. Probably not though. What is the use of a grocery list that you can't take to get groceries? DoctorRabbitfoot Open "Keep" on phone at grocery store, see list. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Open Keep on Android Wear watch at grocery store, and both of my hands are free. I can't believe they take this awesome feature away :-( Roy Seriously, my #1 favorite use for keep was this exact scenario. I can't believe they're breaking it like this. "Add ____ to ____ list" has always been an awesome command - I have multiple lists in Keep that I have maintained like this and I can only imagine they are getting rid of this functionality entirely as Assistant takes over what the old Google Search can do (removing tons of features along the way). XgudwilX Creating a list to Keep with voice commands have been there long before Assistant. Just tap the search bar mic or say ok Google and make the list. All I said ( & not from assistant ) was ok Google, Make a Home Depot list. +Once the list is created, you can add items days later too. Still works for me anyway, on all my devices (without the assistant too) . I actually cant stand the new assistant on my Nexus 6P...i'm trying to make a list and it defaults to this annoying "shopping" list every time. Useless. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/850ace0d32ee4346b1258ba72b735d2e720b81f59a8a4b2a11d405cba5e39d32.png Guillaum Gibault Moving it from Keep to Google Home? Very weird move... dhamp2g I guess they want us to spend more time in the home app??? Martin Dumb move... Don't think enough people have Google Home for this move... Especially outside US... I really like adding stuff with GA and then checking my shopping list on Keep... But it's Google after all, when they did something right without turning it into complete trash later... :) EcE They should at least be synced and the list in keep should continue to work the way it is. I bet most people wouldn't even check the new list, that's what keep is for! Navarr Barnier This is a very poor decision by the Google Home team. I use keep whenever I need to take notes, I have my shopping list shared with my wife, we'll update it from our computers or phones and from Google Home. Now - I guess we have to do it through a phone app or through home itself, and check back there? No looking at it on the PC anymore I guess. Google is starting to look worse for power users, and I say that as a very heavy investor into the ecosystem. I typically try to defend Google's actions but it's hitting closer and closer to home recently. What do you want to bet that as a GApps free user I either won't be able to use a shopping list or won't be able to share it with my non-GApps wife, now? xxTheGoDxx I just checked, you can't even install the Home app on tablets. How dumb is this!? The Keep list was even accessible on my smartwatch, now I can only open it on my phone. Empraim Not true. I have the Home app on my Nexus 9 tablet Marty It's a shame Google is either too lame or too lazy to put a sort function in Keep to sort your grocery list so you don't have to search and search through an unsorted list to find what you're looking to add to the needs list. Mace Moneta This is why I installed Nextcloud on our server. Google is becoming tedious to keep up with. HD I just wish to write this and can't help myself, Fuck you Google! This was one of the most helpful things for non-US users out there who don't even use Google Assistant/Allo/Google Now/Now on Tap or what not. Fuck you for again ruining and once again this proves your amateurish move in managing softwares. FUCK YOU for ruining Keep! CD RW If you don't use assistant , nothing changes for you. You're completly overeacting Laura Palmer I made my wife put Keep on her iPhone for our shopping list, now I'm gonna have to make her put Home??? So confusing for people. Stop changing shit Google!! Chris Wachtman I'm guessing this won't change anything for users like myself who created a shopping list in Keep and manage it through the Keep app. I had hoped that eventually users would be able to teach Assistant which Keep lists to manage (groceries, todos, bucket, party planning, books to read, etc...). I think this would attract a lot of people to use assistant more often to help manage their daily thoughts and tasks. saf1927 Yeah for us it's probably going to change nothing Andy Gates Through the older Google app, "ok google add THING to LISTNAME list" integrates with Keep and is absolutely magical. I almost wish I hadn't discovered it... Brahman Aly Not only did Assistant stop adding things to my already started grocery list in Keep, now this crap! Wth Google!? Andrew This is the exact reason why I didn't use the Alexa list... Oh well madbotboy Probably my number one use case for Google Home, and they go and break it! My Keep list is shared with my spouse who had a different G account. It is very useful, and has been the main reason she has reluctantly started using G Home. An option to keep sharing the list with Keep would be the best option. Nate This is my story exactly! JimmyHoffaHendrix This move is complete crap. Having in keep was great I could share easily with my wife and we could use on our smartwatches. Guess gonna have to write some IFTTT stuff to get working back in keep or just write full on app to do this. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ One could hope that they are just moving the list management into assistant before they start adding syncing integrations. Problem with the way it was is that once it sends to keep it forgets the items. At least this way it can keep track of them and now more syncing options can be created. Think about how Alexa works. Mathew Michel I can only hope!! Keep just makes so much more sense to check a list if not using voice. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah 100% agree. I am hoping for more integrations too like if they could integrate with Todoist I would so much love that! Keep is semi nice for keeping lists but nothing beats Todoist with tasks and shipping lists just sayin :P wicketr Try out Wunderlist or Todoist. They are MUCH, MUCH better compared to Google's hacked-in Keep lists. You'll seriously never miss Keep list after giving them a shot. The Wunderlist free version offers more than Todoist, but the paid version of Todoist is better than Wunderlist. yentrog31 will my Goog Home lists show up there? Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nope! Not yet at least but I am hoping this move is to set GA up to sync to 3rd parties like Todoist or Wunderlist instead of just shipping it off to Keep and forgetting about it. Andy Gates "ok google, take a note to cat food" is a horrible kludge, and it goes into Wunder's Inbox, but at least it functions, I guess? Warren Skipper This is the dumbest idea by Google. Why not give us the option to allow Google Assistant to access the shopping list via Keep or Home? fredphoesh I changed to Keep FROM Buy Me A Pie because of the adding by voice. Buy Me A Pie is superior in two regards. 1/ you can categorise items by colour (aisle if you like) and it doesnt allow duplicates, which is something I hate about Keep... you can have 100 tomatoes on your list, it is a very dumb list. What I would like is for Google's API for Assistant to be open to devs like those that make Buy Me A Pie, so I can use that app to add via voice. OK GOOGLE add chicken pie and tabasco and a big fish to my shopping list... Amblin I would be fine with this if Google would bring proper Keep integration with Assistant/Home. wjrandon For shopping list: Bring > Google Home Scott Booo! This is the problem I have with Amazon Alexa. Why the heck would I keep a list in the Home app? surethom Alexa shopping list is supposed to work offline but 9 times out of 10 it does not & UK have very patchy cellular coverage in supermarkets. Google home shopping list worked online ONLY stupid move. Jason Pagliaro It's supposed to work offline? The main reason I switched off Alexa and onto Home for shopping lists is because I couldn't get the stupid app to load with spotty service. That, and it took forever to load anyway and would fail to stay in memory properly so had to be reopened every time. surethom Same here I was looking forward to Google home for Google Keep shopping lists. I just checked NO if no connection, shopping list option dissappear from the Google home app. NOT Happy. Spudly_McGudly I know it's not solving the cause of the issue, but you mention patchy phone signal in supermarkets.. don't most of the big one's have free wifi nowadays? Problem solved. surethom Not sure if u are from UK or America but in UK Wifi in supermarkets or stores, no not in the UK well not in any I have ever visited. bekifft Seems Google is just copying the Alexa model. They really shouldn't. The Alexa app is probably my least favorite thing about the Echo. YuCMi I don't even know or care what Google's strategy is sometimes. It's as if they flip a coin to make decisions. Abhijeet Why? James Briano Create a messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Grocery List and another messaging app to communicate with my Home Assistant Dry Goods List and I'm totally sold. Great move, Google! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Good bye to my Google Home managed shopping list on my Android Wear watch :-( What a stupid move! Max Luong +1 I really hope they don't forget about the watch. I much prefer ticking things off on the watch rather than pulling the phone out constantly and juggling it whilst hands are full with shopping. Atoqir Why are they breaking everything out to other or new apps. I am pretty sure I won't be able to acces this new list through the web. All this assistant are phone only. surethom I'm in the UK & this has already happened & SHOPPING list does not work this way because it does not work offline. Most supermarkets in the UK have NO cellular network so you can't access your shopping list, so it's useless. Either needs an update to work offline or stay with KEEP & bring that to UK please. Hail Caesar! Why..??? I mean just how many people, outside the US, even use Google Home?? Even in the US for that matter. Leonardo Baez Many more than you think Merf Urgh. This was an awesome feature my wife and I loved. Then I bought a pixel. No longer could I voice save to the same list. Now it's to be moved to another app designed for a device we don't own and is not available on my country. Grey I just want to pile on. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard the Google Assistant team is allergic to Google services. Instead of working on seamless integration between Assistant and Keep, they pull this stunt. So, Google has now fragmented note-taking on their platform. Why does this sound familiar? Kevin Davis Poor decision on the part of Google. ngwoo There goes the last reason to actually use voice commands regularly. Glenn Bolton Dumb Dumb Dumb. Google rolls out a great tool and then makes it "better" and then discontinues it. SMH. Bryan I use Google Keep for my shopping list because I can access it from my watch. And I can share the list with my wife easily. Can the new shopping list be shared easily? Or does the same user need to log into multiple devices. The same issue with Android TV: Google doesn't assume multiple people using the same device. Sir_Brizz Same. This seems like a downgrade. Kevin Aaronson This is bullshit. This feature was the only useful thing home can do, and the only reason it is still in my house. My wife and I use it every other day. Peterson Silva What? I didn't even know I had a shopping assistant in Keep Rod Am I the only one that doesn't give a damn about these assistants? I can take care of my stuff. Richard Footitt Hmmm......using assistant to make shopping lists is about all I do with Assistant. I don't have Home or even the Home app on my phone. It was there but seems to have vanished completely. Not happy with this change. Vedang Jadhav What? I was expecting a new app for that ! Disappointed! NinoBr0wn It's like every one of Google's departments are in a persistent tug o war with one another, and nobody gives a allo about unity. xxTheGoDxx The Home app seems neither compatible with my tablet nor with my Android Wear watch and there is of course also no Google Home webpage, so does that mean any shopping list made via Google Home is now only accessible from my phone? Who the fuck comes up with that shit? NashGuy This stinks. Just about the only thing I use "OK Google" voice commands for with my phone (I don't have a Google Home) is to add things to the grocery list. But I liked being able to also manually add things to that Keep list on my Mac. So there goes that. And since the list will now be buried under a menu inside the Home app, it will take more clicks to go there on my phone. So far, the "upgrade" to Google Assistant on my Nexus 5X hasn't done anything to improve my life and now it's actually making things worse. Andy Gates But but but in the old app we have "add THING to my LISTNAME list" and it works wonderfully for list hoarders. Assistant is being weird and annoying and now less relevant. Empraim noooo! I love having the shopping list i Keep. Keep can give me an reminder on the shopping list when I enter the supermarket, will I now loose this feature??? VAVAMk_2 Why? It's fine how it is. Daniel Hooper Looks like UK have got it 2 days early because asking Google home to update shopping list already adds it to shopping list in the home app menu, which directs you to website when you click on it, where you can share it. But if you tell your android phone to add to shopping list, it still uses keep .....Urgh very annoying and useless richkoos My mom just got the LG watch style and she uses the shopping list all the time and the watch. Do you think she'll be able to view the shopping list on the watch after the change? I feel like that would be an oversight if you can't. Matt Richards I just purchased Google home and I can confirm this is all happening. When you create a shopping list it is stored in the Google home app. When you open the list to it opens up in a webpage. Really puzzling move, sounded like having it in Google Keep was a no brainer! You can't remove items through Google home or manually. Bill Van For the first six months or so, your shopping lists should be populated in both Home and Keep, why not? The Google Keep app is awesome and I love using it daily. Philip Blakemore 8th April, UK and my list has moved to https://www.google.com/express/shoppinglist/lists No way of accessing it with no internet, e.g. back of a store with no phone signal and no WiFi. Back to "Shopping List" for me. What a dumb move Google, there is not 100% internet access you know 😠 surethom Totally agree if they insist on this they should make the stupid shopping list in Google home available offline. bekifft Minor correction, "infers" in last paragraph should be "implies." And yeah, this is just so classic Google. So many people are asking them to fix basic functionality like reminders, and so of course what they're working on instead is taking away some of the little bit of functionality it actually had. I really wish I wasn't past my return window on this piece of junk. JonERotn The speaker does the implying, and the listener does the inferring. Petr Faitl That's beyond insane! Let's take the integration out of an everyday app and stick it to a setup/Chromecast promo app that you'll not touch past the first 10mins with Google Home. Shopping list is number One use for the Google Home in our household, so this move will seriously dampen my enthusiasm for GH use. pfmiller I have no reason to have Google Home installed and this isn't helping. Manual shopping lists it is for now. Andy I guess most of us will have no way of actually accessing our shopping lists in future. Living outside of the US means (1) I have no access to the Google Express app and (2) my Google Home app does not have any list feature. Without having a Google Home, the app is essentially a Chromecast setup app. So Google.... Please tell me where I'm supposed to find the shopping list you allow me to create through the Google Assistant. nside1 Best place to leave feedback on this bonehead move? pfmiller Send feedback through either Keep our Google Home. Or both. surethom I already have but big companies especially Google don't really care about feedback of a change if they have made up there mind, unfortunately. cbryancan "... which infers that..." Implies, not infers. lgg4 100% against this - we use it all the time and works great in Keep. Will be confusing g o have it in Home. Can use Keep on my Android watch too. MrVirly I thought it was weird when I started using Assistant on my 6P. I have used Google Now to add stuff to the manual shared shopping list my wife and I have in Keep for ages. With assistant, it wouldn't add things to that note, but to a new one called "Google Assistant Shopping List". Defintiely a step down as now my wife can't really add things. Oh well. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I told you that you should run a series called, "Google Abandoned Feature Of The Day". This is the sort of thing that made me switch away from almost ALL Google apps. I only use a few, and Keep was one of them until recently. The move reminds me of what Amazon does with Alexa's shopping lists. Actually, there are Amazon skills that let you put your shopping list in a supported app of your choice. I happen to use OurGroceries, which I like very much. MeCampbell30 Except this isn't abandoning a feature. It's improving an existing one. These kinds of overgeneralizations really aren't helpful. They're just silly. And frankly, kind getting old. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Please all send feedback to Google: 1. open the Google Home (aka Chromecast) app on your phone 2. navigation drawer → help and feedback 3. select "Google Home" 4. write something like this: Please keep the Google Home managed shopping list in Google Keep. Being able to view and check off items using Google Keep on my Android Wear watch is extremely useful, it would be a bad move to take away this option :-( D Canfield And if folks are too lazy to do that, "OK Google - send feedback - don't take the shopping list out of keep!" Probably not as effective as the formal report, but it's at least something. Maybe even do both. B. Boot Exactly! Google has integrated feedback into almost everything. Use it! You will reach the right group that way. You may also be talking to their AI which will eventually be better than people at taking and integrating feedback. UniBroW I'm just weaning myself off of Google products personally Robert Batts Google is taking the most helpful thing in Google Home and throwing it away. Sharing lists in Keep was awesome. Nathan J Cool. OurGroceries will again be the undisputed king of grocery lists for sharing between devices, across platforms, and the web. Using a note taking program like Keep or Evernote is okay, I guess, but until you've used OurGroceries... it just doesn't add up. From my iPhone to my wife's Android phone to their website, everything just syncs up automatically. The Android version has a dark theme and can input/scan barcodes as well. Both can add and categorize items, and add a picture to the item. So there's no question which item the person wants. The app is free, with a $4.99 IAP to remove the ads (or just use an ad blocker, LOL). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yup. That's what I use with Alexa and everything else. It's a great app. Worth the money to remove ads. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

XgudwilX Good, now when I say "add red bull to my walmart list", maybe it'll stop going to this useless & default Assistant "Shopping" list. It was working fine (in Keep) from Google Now/Search forever.. Why this was added to make things complicated makes no sense. Hello I have all kinds of lists..not just a "shopping" list that the Assistant wants to throw everything on. The back n forth voice commands between Assistant and Google Now or Search, whatever it's supposed to be called, is getting old too. So far Assistant's been a pain in the ass. Same goes for the Now On Tap (camera) image search and the copy & select text from any screen..why are those gone? Nooo, we get jokes, games , and ONE shopping list. Thomas Hunsaker Why can't we choose a note/list app like we do with music or other assistant services? Does the Google Home app allow viewing of lists on Android Wear? whollyfool What about calling the list something else, like "meijers"? They're probably only moving the one called "shopping".

Stupid idea, Googe needs to make the Shopping List avaiable OFFLINE aswell or it is just not fit for purpose. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHbz20mJ47I ytpunx14 I can understand the frustration here. I have a Google home and use Google Express for ordering different items so for me it makes a little more sense. I can see how for those who don't even have Google home downloaded that this could be a huge inconvenience. Why not just have it live in both places??? dcdttu One more thing shoved into the Home app. Great. AJ75 Just use Chefling. It works with Google home. galgabot I hate assistant, I love keep, April 10 is my birthday. Thanks Google! wahoowa Whatever. Just tell me there will be some way to access the list on my watch. That's my favorite thing a out keep being my grocery list. Crossstick No change as of 7pm east coast USA. Google still putting items into the Goog. Assistant Keep shopping list. Andy Mine has changed. Grrr. And i have nowhere that I can actually access my list from (besides asking GA to show me the list). As a non-American I don't have Google Express or a Google Home. So I can use neither the Express nor the Home app to find my list ... I really don't know what Google was thinking. Crossstick I'm American and don't want Google Express or Google Home. This is stupid Google. Forcing users back to manual list-making in Keep.

Yesterday GOOG: 824.73 0.06 Which of these features do you actually want in your smartwatch? [Poll] Justin Duino - Apr. 10th 2017 4:14 pm PT @jaduino Android Wear poll View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With the launch of Android Wear 2.0, Google wanted smartwatches to become more than just smartphone companion devices. For the most part, this meant having built-in fitness and connectivity features. Unfortunately, more functionality typically means larger and thicker smartwatches. What features do you actually want in a smartwatch? Google and LG announced two new smartwatches alongside the official release of Android Wear 2.0: the Watch Sport and Watch Style. The Sport was the perfect example of a watch offering so many different things that critics said it was big, stiff, and bulky. The Watch Style, on the opposite side of the spectrum, offers almost nothing on top of the standard Android Wear experience but did allow for a more appealing wearable. The watches announced since haven’t been any better. For example, this morning we had ZTE announce the Quartz which will be sold for $192 exclusively on T-Mobile’s network. While the low price tag is a great way to get customers to try and use Android Wear, the smartwatch is incredibly thick to accommodate for cellular and GPS functionality. Although these are useful for some, based on our comment section, a majority of users would prefer a thinner device with less functionality that could last more than a day on a single charge. So what features are in your ideal smartwatch? Is there a watch already on the market that matches all of your wishes? Answer the poll below and let us know your thoughts in the comments!

The Pixel XL comes to us with a polished glass and metal backing and the Galaxy S8 keeps its all glass format. The design of the two devices makes them look very different from one another. The Pixel XL has a more straightforward mobile phone look, while the Galaxy S8 with its new Infinity Display looks almost futuristic when compared to the Pixel XL. The Google Pixel XL is going after those users that want the pure Android experience in a flagship smartphone. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is going after an audience of millennials that demand the latest and greatest in a smartphone. Let’s see just what these two smartphones have in common and just how much they differ. The Google Pixel XL and the Samsung Galaxy S8 do have a few things in common. The first would be their physical size with the Pixel XL slightly larger and weighing 13 grams more. Their displays are very close, with the Pixel XL using a 5.5-inch display and the Galaxy S8 using a 5.8-inch display. Both displays use the QHD resolution (QHD+ on the S8) and the same AMOLED technology. They both use a Snapdragon processor; although the Pixel XL is using the older SD821 model and the Galaxy S8 uses the newest SD835 and both use an Adreno GPU for graphics. They both are packing 4GB of DDR4 RAM and the Pixel XL has a 32GB or 128GB of fixed memory, while the Galaxy S8 starts at 64GB of memory that is expandable via a microSD card. Both devices offer an excellent camera area, in fact, DxOMark listed the Pixel XL camera as the best smartphone camera they have tested. They each have a fingerprint sensor to unlock the device as well as to authorize mobile payments, including Android Pay. Both devices have a non-removable battery that has rapid charge. They both have the usual suspects – WiFi, Bluetooth (v4.2 in the Pixel XL and v5.0 in the S8), GPS, NFC, and a Type-C reversible port for charging and data transfer. They also are both running Android 7.0 Nougat, although the Pixel is upgraded to 7.1. Please take a thoughtful look at the detailed Specifications Comparison chart below, and here you will see just how these two great devices stack up against one another – click on the “View Full Comparison” link at the end of the chart to expand the details. After that, we will look at each device in greater depth and point out some of its pros and cons. From all of this information, we will try to determine the winner based on specs and execution of design and functions. Specifications Google Pixel XL Google rid themselves of the Nexus moniker in 2016 and introduced us to the Pixel and Pixel XL. It caused quite a stir with longtime Nexus lovers and the media. Google is trying to be more like the fruit across the aisle and create their own ecosystem that ‘nudges’ customers into buying more Google products. There is not too much differentiation between the two Pixel models – mostly just in the screen size, display resolution, and the battery. We will be looking at the Google Pixel XL because a 5.5-inch display with QHD resolution is better suited to go against the Galaxy S8. Let’s see how this newly designed Pixel XL with its polished glass and metal construction holds up to the new Galaxy S8’s all glass construction and the specifications that it brings to the table. The Google Pixel XL sports a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with a Quad HD resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels and a robust 531 pixels-per-inch (PPI.) It is using the Qualcomm 821 quad-core processor with a dual-core clocked at 1.6GHZ and a dual-core clocked at 2.15GHz. This is really the SD820 on ‘steroids’ and packs 10-percent better performance according to Qualcomm. It packs 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 32GB or 128GB of fast UFS 2.0 memory with no means to expand. It uses a large 3450mAh non-removable battery for power and has rapid charge capabilities. Google put a lot of thought into the camera area on its Pixel models. The specifications on paper are not that impressive – a 12.3MP sensor for their main camera along with an aperture of f/2.0, phase detection autofocus (PDAF,) a dual-tone LED flash, and no OIS. The 8MP front-facing camera (FFC) is a nice size, comes with an f/2.0 aperture, a 1.4µm pixel size, 1080p, and offers excellent selfies and video chatting. Even with these ordinary specs, the Pixel camera was tested by DxOMark and received a score of 89 – the highest yet for a smartphone. A rear-mounted fingerprint sensor will allow you to unlock your device or authorize mobile payments. Android Pay will be part of the package as well and it is the first smartphone to have Google Assistant built into the device. The Pixel XL measures in at 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6mm and weighs in at 168 grams. It comes in Quite Black, Very Silver, and Really Blue (as a limited edition.) It will be running Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box. The 32GB Google Pixel XL is IP53 rated and will cost you about $770. Samsung Galaxy S8 Do you remember the Samsung Galaxy S7? The new Samsung Galaxy S8 will not remind you one iota about its predecessor. The flat display is gone and in comes the new Infinity Display that effortlessly wraps around the sides of the device and into the glass back, allowing Samsung to squeeze much more display into a smaller area. The physical ‘Home’ button, a longtime staple on a Samsung device, is gone and replaced with an on-screen key. The lower part of the display has 3D Touch capabilities and when pressed, the ‘Home’ as well as the ‘Back’ and ‘App’ keys magically appear on the lower part of the display. Although the fingerprint sensor is now on the back, inconveniently located near the camera lens, Samsung gives us easier ways to unlock the device – facial recognition and an iris scanner. The new Galaxy S8 is one sexy device, even more so than the ‘Edge’ display. But what kind of specs does it supply us with and while we know it has enough beauty, does it have enough beast in it to topple the Google Pixel XL. The Galaxy S8 has a much larger 5.8-inch Infinity Display compared to the 5.1-inch display on the Galaxy S7. It comes with a Super AMOLED QHD+ display and a resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels and 570 PPI. Samsung set the default resolution to 2220 x 1080 to conserve battery life, but it can be manually turned up to the maximum resolution through the settings. The display uses an 18.5:9 aspect ratio that makes it taller and slightly narrower because it truly does go edge-to-edge taking up 83.6-percent of the front of the phone. Samsung kept the excellent ‘always-on’ screen to help save battery life and to make it easier and quicker to check notifications. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protects the display and back of the device. Samsung put in the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core processor, the first to use the 10nm technology and clocked it at 2.35GHz. An Adreno 540 GPU rounds out the models destined for the US. In other countries, the Galaxy S8 will use Samsung’s Exynos 8895 octa-core 10nm processor with four cores clocked at 1.7GHz and four cores clocked at 2.3GHz. The Galaxy S8 packs 4GB of DDR4 RAM and has 64GB of the faster UFS 2.1 expandable memory via a microSD card. It was a little surprising that Samsung used the same camera from the Galaxy S7 with a Dual Pixel 12MP sensor as Samsung decided to concentrate on making advancements to their imaging software. The Galaxy S8 even uses same f/1.7 (one of the largest apertures in a smartphone camera), a 26mm lens, PDAF, LED flash, auto HDR and OIS. Samsung did make some changes to the FFC. They enlarged it from a 5MP to an 8MP sensor and added its own autofocus while retaining its wide-angle lens, the same f/1.7 aperture, and Live HDR. So far, tests show the Galaxy S8 to produce excellent photos. Samsung also kept the same sized non-removable 3000mAh battery that features Quick Charge and still offers Quick Wireless Charging. Samsung always has included many extras on its flagship, some more useful than others, and the Galaxy S8 is no exception. It has an IP68 rating against dust and water and Samsung’s new Bixby personal assistant works a lot like Google Assistant. Bixby involves the camera as well to answer your questions – point it at a historical building and you will get the history of the place or aim it at a sign in a foreign language, and Bixby will translate it for you. The Galaxy S8 still sports a heart rate monitor and oxygen saturation sensor. Samsung’s S-Health is replaced by Samsung Health and a new Samsung Connect feature to tie together Samsung’s appliances, SmartTVs, thermostats and other IoT (Internet of Things). Samsung’s has another new feature called a DeX Station that will interface the Galaxy S8 with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for a near desktop experience. The Galaxy S8 can use both Android Pay as well as Samsung Pay, which allows Galaxy S8 users more freedom to make mobile purchases just about anywhere a merchant can swipe a credit or debit card. The Galaxy S8 will come with Android Nougat 7.0, followed by a quick upgrade, or it may possibly include 7.1 by release time. It measures 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm, weighs in at 155 grams, is available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue, and Maple Gold depending where you are located. The Galaxy S8 will cost about $720 outright and is now available for pre-order to be delivered no later than April 21. …And The Winner Is… The Final Word The pure Android users will probably disagree with me, but the Galaxy S8 is the hands down winner of this comparison. It has a better design than the Google Pixel there just is no comparison in that department. A part of those great looks comes from the larger Infinity Display, yet it is in a smaller body than the Pixel XL. Getting past the subjective ‘looks’ component, the specs are much better as well. Let’s start with the processor – the SD835 has so many new features and improvements over the SD821, not to mention the improved Adreno 540. The Galaxy S8 has more base memory and the ability to expand that memory and it has Hi-Res audio for a better listening experience through your earbuds. It has newer Bluetooth, it is IP68 certified, offers wireless charging, a heart rate monitor, and an oxygen saturation sensor. The Galaxy S8 gives better security with its iris scanner and facial recognition, and expands places you can make purchases via Samsung Pay. The Google Pixel XL is an excellent smartphone and will always receive its software upgrades faster than other devices. It also gives you access to Google Assistant, if you are interested in Google Home, etc. The Pixel XL does have a larger battery, but with quick charge and the Galaxy S8’s more efficient SD835 processor, we doubt you will notice any difference. To top it all off, these two devices will cost you about the same at the cash register – in fact, there are many freebies and discounts already on the Galaxy S8. The Galaxy S8 simply offers more bang for your buck, and looks marvelous while doing it.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Opinion Google pay gap: Why Google would have been in a lot of trouble if it was an Icelandic company Google pay gap: Why Google would have been in a lot of trouble if it was an Icelandic company If Google had been an Icelandic company, it would have been in a lot of trouble over its alleged pay gap By: The Financial Express | Published: April 11, 2017 5:37 AM Now, juxtapose this with the US Department of Labor charging internet giant Google with paying its women workers, on an average, lesser than their male counterparts for the same work across board. (Reuters) Iceland could soon make it illegal to pay men more than women. Companies with more than 25 employees must prove that they pay women employees as much as they pay men, or face punitive measures, if the Bill that the Icelandic parliament is examining becomes law. The Scandinavian country was at the top of the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap 2015 index, with a low 14-18% pay gap between the sexes. But the country now intends to close that gap completely. This comes in the backdrop of the protest last year in October in which women left work early, with remainder of the working day corresponding in terms of time to the average pay gap between men and women in the country. Now, juxtapose this with the US Department of Labor charging internet giant Google with paying its women workers, on an average, lesser than their male counterparts for the same work across board. The American labour department said that the “discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme”. The US Census Bureau found in 2015 that white women earned just 80 cents for the work that paid white men $1. To be sure, companies argue pays are based on merit and experience, but it is hard to believe that merit is the preserve of a particular race or sex as is reflected in the pay data. You may also like to watch: While Iceland is setting an example for the Western world—it has sparked similar discussions in the UK and France—India, which ranked a lowly 108 in the Gender Gap rankings, ironically, protects equal pay for equal work under the Constitution. But despite that, the gap on economic participation and opportunity, India’s score on the index is 0.383 (the closer a country’s score is to zero the more unequal it is with 1 representing complete equality). Female labour force participation in the country has stagnated at 26-28% in urban areas and has fallen from 57% to 44% in rural areas. Now, it is possible that women left the workforce voluntarily as household incomes increased, rather than because of discrimination. Their withdrawal remains a worry, nevertheless. No Comments.

The investigation isn’t complete but the department has received compelling evidence of “significant discrimination,” the Guardian reported, citing the Labor Department’s regional solicitor, Janet Herold. The allegations come at a time when Silicon Valley is under the microscope like never before for reports of discrimination against women. Uber Technologies Inc. has been investigating claims of sexual harassment from a former engineer, while investors across the tech world are wondering how to transform both start-ups and more established digital companies into more egalitarian workplaces.

[Update: Google responds] Google still hasn't solved the Play Store's fake review epidemic Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 1:57pm PDTApr 10, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares61 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/10 4:12pm PDT A Google spokesperson reached out to us, and provided the following statement: "We're aware of the recent spammy reviews on Google Play and have taken action to remove them. We're constantly Fake reviews on the Play Store, or any other online marketplace, are not new at all. But over the years, Google has stayed ahead of the curve with improved fraud and spam detection. But in the past few weeks, the amount of obviously fake reviews has skyrocketed. The reviews seem mostly targeted at popular apps, especially from Google - including Hangouts, Gmail, and Chrome. Many of them talk about each app as if it were a game - mentioning power-ups, Poker, and Bingo. Last time I checked, Hangouts didn't have a Poker game built-in. App developers paying for positive reviews is a somewhat common practice, but Google doesn't have a reason to do this. So why is it happening? One possible answer is that by reviewing multiple popular apps, each Google account would be less likely to be flagged by the company's spam filters. Many reviews are harder to distinguish from real ones, by simply saying "Good" or "Great." Here are a few examples from the Chrome listing (found below a review mentioning Bingo): We reached out to Google about a week ago about this problem, but we did not receive a response. At this point, it's hard to imagine Google isn't aware of the problem - but it may be difficult to fix.

So, if search results become poisoned or tainted they can have a significant effect. That can happen if a fake story gains enough traction. Eventually, the fake story becomes so popular and re-reported it transcends the boundary between falsehood and accepted. Google has now rolled out their Fact Check label globally to help us tell the difference between validated and unvalidated news. According to Google's blog, the Fact Check label in Google News is available everywhere, and expanding it into Search globally in all languages. When you conduct a search on Google that returns an authoritative result you'll see hope the search results have been validated. If you search for information on an alleged incident the search results will display who has validated the report. Google says they are not doing the fact checks themselves. They are relying on third parties. That means some search results may come back as validated while the same search conducted by someone else may pull in sources that claim the report is not verified. So, while Google's results won't authoritatively tell you if a story is accurate, it will provide some validation so you can make a more informed judgement. Publishers wanting to take advantage of the Fact Check feature for their content need to use the Schema.org ClaimReview markup on the specific pages where they fact check public statements or the Share the Facts widget developed by the Duke University Reporters Lab and Jigsaw.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

Well, that feature is now rolling out to everyone. Google engineer Justin Uberti has announced that Google Duo’s audio-only calling feature is now available around the world. If you haven’t yet updated your Duo app, doing so now should get you audio call support. Google Duo's new audio calling feature now available worldwide! pic.twitter.com/gFQxQTcu2S — Justin Uberti (@juberti) April 10, 2017 Google Duo is focused on video calls, but it’s good to see Google adding support for audio-only calls to the app. There may be times when you need to call someone but a video call may not be appropriate. Now you can use Duo as your sole calling app without having to worry about what you’ll do during those times. Have you ever used Google Duo?

Could Amazon become an enterprise collaboration contender? Amazon has a series of apps that compete with Office 365 and G Suite, but they currently aren’t packaged and sold as a collective portfolio. Here’s how Amazon could become a major player in business software. Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 11 April, 2017 04:23 - - - - print email Comments Microsoft has for decades owned the intersection of collaboration, productivity and communication. However, as these services shifted to the cloud, it opened pathways for greater competition and flexibility in how organizations deployed applications for their workforce. Through G Suite, Google has stretched its resources and refined its family of apps for enterprise. The market is far from locked up, however, and analysts see at least some room for new players to emerge to challenge Google and Microsoft. Could Amazon be the dark horse of enterprise collaboration? The company has a dominating position in cloud-based infrastructure, but its moves in the application market, albeit reserved, have yet to deliver similar impact. But what if it decides to focus on the collaboration market? [ Related: 6 IT leaders share tips to drive collaboration ] Gauging Amazon’s potential impact “[Amazon] could have an impact if they get serious about it, but I have not seen many signs of that happening,” says Jeffrey Mann, research vice president at Gartner. “WorkMail and WorkDocs have been around for a couple years with nothing really compelling about them, and very little uptake. Chime is a more recent addition, but they are still pretty far from having a complete suite or much to differentiate their offerings.” Amazon will disrupt whichever space it decides to jump into, but Amazon is unlikely to go head to head with Microsoft’s Office 365 or Google’s G Suite, according to Raul Castanon-Martinez, senior analyst at 451 Research. “The lines are blurring between business communications and enterprise collaboration and productivity -- and their convergence is defining a new segment which some vendors are calling ‘collaborative communications’ or ‘workflow communications,’” he says. “Amazon, Google and Microsoft are each approaching the market from different angles. Google and Microsoft are strong contenders when it comes to productivity tools, while Amazon is focusing on business communications and team meetings. All three overlap with it comes to collaboration.” [ Related: G Suite vs. Office 365 cloud collaboration battle heats up ] Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw, says Amazon has been smart to focus on areas that are being over or underserved in the market. Chime, for example, is “much less feature-packed than some of the alternatives, but performs the key functions of a web conferencing solution much better than the competition, notably WebEx,” he says. Web conferencing is easier to displace than a productivity suite as comprehensive as Office 365 or G Suite, he adds. “I think Amazon would struggle if it tried to take on Microsoft and Google in the core productivity space, and it’s better off continuing to nibble at the edges in areas where those companies are weak.” Amazon would face challenges vs. Microsoft and Google If Amazon decide to package a suite of services to compete with Microsoft and Google, it would encounter significant challenges and put a spotlight on every missing piece in its app portfolio. “The challenge is how much are they going to be able to offer that’s going to differentiate and how much are they going to be able to offer that’s going to at least meet the minimum bar of what people are expecting in communication and collaboration portfolios,” says TJ Keitt, senior analyst, Forrester. “Enterprise cloud office has been a very hard market to crack,” Mann says. “Big companies like Novell, Oracle, Cisco and IBM have failed. Apple has stayed away from it. I can understand why they are holding back.” [ Battle of the clouds: Amazon Web Services vs. Microsoft Azure vs. Google Cloud Platform ] Amazon would also be a late entrant without a compelling offering, according to Mann. The company would also have to contend without an ecosystem to extend or support their system and a lack of awareness that Amazon is even in the market, he says. “This is a volume-driven market. Without millions of seats, it will be hard to compete.” The inherent power of incumbency, particularly from entrenched providers like Microsoft, would be Amazon’s biggest challenge, according to Dawson. “Companies’ reliance on the Office suite and the associated back-end services like Exchange are huge barriers to switching, as Google has discovered over the years,” he says. “Google has slowly eroded some of that resistance over time, and has done particularly well among smaller companies with less legacy infrastructure, but it’s still an uphill battle. So for a company like Amazon, with very little track record in end user productivity software, it’ll be a long road.” AWS could be Amazon’s wild card Amazon has at least one powerful tool, Amazon Web Services, that could support the company’s pursuit of cloud-based apps for work, but analysts don’t believe that underlying infrastructure will be enough on its own to overcome areas where it still lacks core competencies. If Amazon’s strategy is to position AWS as a gateway to a range of services, the company will have to appeal directly to the needs of its existing AWS customers and it appears many of those organizations needs are already being met elsewhere, according to Keitt. [ Download the State of the CIO 2017 research report ] “Many companies do already have a relationship with Amazon for AWS, and that may help with relationships and trust, but providing end user software is very different from supplying IT departments with cloud services, and that’s going to be a tough transition for Amazon,” Dawson says. “Yes, AWS underpins these newer services and that may make some integration work easier, but it’s far from the most important facet or issue of a migration like this.” Amazon is slowly moving up the stack, but its key strength remains in AWS and the synergies created when enterprise apps are run on the cloud, according to Castanon-Martinez. “Running a critical collaboration tool on AWS makes sense give its global reach and extensive communications infrastructure already in place,” he says. AWS also has a “well-earned reputation for reliability and scalability,” which will be key benefits for any services Amazon decides to launch. Areas where Amazon can compete Amazon has yet to package its apps for end users into a comprehensive suite, but the company is already in the market with a range of apps including WorkDocs, WorkMail, WorkSpaces, Chime, QuickSight and AppStream. “To a certain extent the company is already competing although their focus is clearly on team collaboration and not so much on personal productivity,” Castanon-Martinez says. “Amazon typically competes on price and scale so that is something we can expect by default, but the market is moving away from feature parity,” he says. Amazon could also capitalize on the unnecessary complexity of Office 365 and G Suite with a product portfolio that doesn’t overlap and create confusion for customers. “Both Google and Microsoft need to streamline their enterprise collaboration, productivity and communications tools while Amazon is starting fresh,” Castanon-Martinez says. Mann says he would advise Amazon to position its apps as an opportunistic offering with low expectations. “This is a demanding market with mature products, so it will be hard to compete on a head-to-head basis,” he says. “Amazon could potentially compete on price, if they were willing to invest massive amounts and suffer losses for several years before building up enough volume.” While Microsoft and Google have weak spots in their suites, it’s not clear what capabilities Amazon can develop that would differentiate it from these widely used services that have become standard in many businesses. “That’s the overarching question and to this point they haven’t unveiled anything, and best I can tell they haven’t made too many acquisitions that would say that’s an area they’re going to play in,” Keitt says. “Unless you are offering something or have figured out a part of the market that is looking for something different and unachievable by the existing players in the marketplace it’s going to be difficult for your business to really make huge waves,” he says. “You never really win in business by trying to compete on someone else’s core competency.” ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

In the skeptics' eyes, phones were still just a sideshow for Google, one meant to showcase its vision of what Android hardware should be rather than any serious attempt to compete with Apple (AAPL) or Samsung (SSNLF) . But Google's heavy spending on ads promoting the Pixel showed that it was taking the business seriously, as did its resale deals with Verizon  (VZ) and certain international carriers and its willingness to temporarily make the Google Assistant service a Pixel exclusive. A new report provides yet another sign that Google is hungry to grow Pixel sales, and perhaps also that the company plans to offer this year's models through more carriers. South Korea's Electronic Times reported Google has offered to invest KRW 1 trillion ($880 million) in LG Display  (LPL) to help the latter create a production line for flexible OLED panels that would be used on second-generation Pixel phones. LG is said to be "carefully considering" the offer. LG Display supplies OLEDs for smartwatches such as the Apple Watch, as well as for OLED TV sets, but the company hasn't been a notable supplier of OLED phone panels. Indeed, whereas Samsung -- the OLED panel market's dominant player -- extensively uses OLEDs within its phones, LG's G6 and V20 high-end phones use LCD panels. Likely motivating Google to adopt flexible OLEDs: The 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch curved OLED displays of Samsung's new Galaxy S8 and S8-Plus phones that have turned heads. In addition, Apple is expected to launch an iPhone 8 with a 5.8-inch curved OLED display this September, and has reportedly ordered 70 million OLED panels from Samsung for its 2017 needs. The first-generation Pixel and Pixel XL both use rigid OLED panels. Apple's apparently huge flexible OLED needs, together with Samsung's internal needs, might be motivating Google to secure supplies from a third party. It's also possible that Google is wary of becoming dependent on Samsung, since high iPhone and Android customer loyalty rates show that Samsung is arguably the Pixel's biggest rival rather than Apple. And like many other U.S. tech giants, Google is sitting on giant stockpiles of offshore cash that -- at least until an offshore tax holiday arrives -- it's looking to find good uses for. Of the $86.3 billion in cash Alphabet had at the end of 2016, $52 billion was parked overseas.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Google in Negotiations with LG on new OLED Plant and Joint R&D Project Regarding Foldable Smartphones | Main April 10, 2017 While Apple is set to hit the Restart Button for the Mac Pro, it's the Smartphone Revolution Part 2 that's far more important   Laptop Mag is just the latest to jump on the bandwagon of dumping on Apple's MacBooks. The report noted that "After seven years of dominance, Apple's reign at the top of our Best & Worst Brands list is over, as the company sinks into a tie for fifth place."   Ever since Apple introduced their new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the critics have come out loudly against it. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, super Apple fan wrote a report titled "How Apple Alienated Mac Loyalists." Mossberg ended 2016 saying that Apple's products weren't up to their historical standards; a nice way to say historical standards … under Steve Jobs.   To top it all off Apple decided to play Russian roulette last week and shoot themselves in the head by admitting that they blew the Mac Pro design and that it would take some time to reinvent their desktop line-up, especially the Mac Pro which could take at minimum until 2018.   Apple last week revealed that they'll be shifting gears for the Mac Pro and move to a modular design, something Microsoft had beaten them to months earlier. Ouch. On the other hand, hearing that Apple admitted that they had gone off course and were doubling down on new serious pro hardware was welcomed news for many.   A Second Storm Front on the Way   Apple's entire group of design and engineering teams are under the gun to not only bring back exciting Macs to market but also make sure that they're not too late in delivering a next-gen foldable smartphone over the next two or three years.   While Apple and Samsung have shown that they have a solid grasp on this coming device category through detailed patents (Samsung, Apple), it's here where Google and Microsoft want to beat Apple to market and pull the rug from under their feet. This could be the window of opportunity for both companies to finally deliver a blow to Apple's leading position in smartphones.   Just today we reported on Google being in negotiations with LG on a new OLED plant and joint R&D project for developing foldable smartphones. Is Google taking this new market segment seriously enough? Yes of course.   And coincidentally Patently Mobile reported on a number of Microsoft patents over the weekend showing that they too have patents on foldable and bendable smartphones and advanced features like 3D Touch, an advanced hovering technology that they've been working on for years.   It only takes one hit product to turn the tide for a company. For Apple it was the iPhone. It came out of nowhere and Microsoft didn't see it coming and even denied it had any relevance when it actually launched. Now Google and Microsoft are no doubt waiting for a similar break that could give them that single edge over Apple that could wound them if not take them down.   It's not to say that the sky is falling because it certainly isn't. Apple just delivered a record quarter. We also posted a report back in October titled "Microsoft's Big Boom in Surface Sales Last Quarter still Miles from Relevancy in Comparison to Apple's iPad." We then followed up with another report in December on how badly their Surface Studio desktop sales did over the holidays. So while Microsoft has been great at pounding their chest like Tarzan during press events, in the end, they've shown to deliver more bark than bite every time.   When it comes to Google, they've had had one Moon Shot project after another go down in flames, be it Google Fiber or Project Ara. And recent products like 'Google Home' and their Pixel smartphone have made close to zero impact on the consumer market. So Google has yet to deliver anything new that has changed the game and their 'Moon Shots' are more like Vaporware.   At the end of the day, another negative review of Apple's MacBook came in today, knocking Apple down a few pegs once again. Yet we learned last week that Apple got the message loud and clear that they missed the boat on pro hardware and they'll remedy it with great new iMac Pros this year and a new modular Mac Pro for 2018.   Yet when it comes to the next storm front, all tech companies will be on the starting line with a fresh start at the same time on hardware and it is unknown who will break from the pack to take the lead in the smartphone revolution part two. Apple's wild card could be smartly integrating Augmented Reality into the mix so that there's a holistic approach to this next market, but only time will tell.   So while the Mac Pro is definitely important, and we're all cheering Apple on, ensuring that they're deadly focused on the next wave of smartphones is far more important.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Contact Newsagent Login Top Scoops Search Scoop     WIRES: SCOOPS PARLIAMENT POLITICS REGIONAL BUSINESS SCI-TECH WORLD CULTURE EDUCATION HEALTH SECTIONS: HOME COMMENT MULTIMEDIA NZ POLITICS BIZ & SCI/TECH WORLD LIFESTYLE ARCHIVES MOST READ VIDEO Book Reviews | Gordon Campbell | Scoop News | Wellington Scoop | Community Scoop | Search    Related  Email  Print Scoop >> Top Scoops Tweet An Important Message To Professional Users Of Scoop Tuesday, 11 April 2017, 9:20 am Article: Alastair Thompson An Important Message To Professional Users Of Scoop From Scoop co-founder Alastair Thompson Dear professional users of Scoop, First, thank you to all our newsagent subscribers and accredited professional organisations. This message is not addressed to you. The professional licence fees paid by Scoop's 140 accredited organisations are the reason Scoop remains online. 90% of the costs of maintaining Scoop are now being met sustainably. This is good news. But with only 90% of our costs being met, we are not quite there yet. Like all news media Scoop has been seriously impacted by the news crisis, a crisis brought about by disruption to advertising markets. In September 2015 after nine months of Operation Chrysalis, Scoop became a charitably owned social enterprise as part of our effort to respond to this crisis. With generous support from member donations Scoop has since undergone a complete business model transformation. We needed to move away from our reliance on fickle advertising revenue. Over a period of 2.5 years we have moved from 70% advertising funding, to 0% advertising funding. An Appeal For You To Take Action Today! As of today, with just four days to go Scoop's latest crowdfunding campaign on PledgeMe remains $13,000 short of its target. If we fail to reach this, Scoop's survival will be threatened. So far 216 Scoop members have pledged towards our campaign. But it is not the intended role of Foundation Members to support Scoop's core publishing activities with donations. Their support should only be needed to help cover our transition. Scoop's core press release publishing operation is for the most part used by professional news users - people who access Scoop seeking information for business and work purposes. Our provision of comprehensive and timely information over the past 17 years has helped oil the wheels of commerce and Government. The value of this service is shown in our 500,000 readers - a sizeable portion of whom access the Scoop website while at work from business network domains. Is Your Organisation Using Scoop Legally? In 2015 Scoop launched a way to make this work as a product, our "Ethical Paywall". Two years on from the launch we have convinced organisations of most kinds – Govt. Departments, Universities, ITPs, law firms, accountancy and consultancy firms, PR companies, NGOs, councils and even NZ's Parliament – to sign on to what we believe is an equitable way to recover the costs of providing the Scoop.co.nz service. But most organisations are still using Scoop in breach of our clearly advertised terms of use. You can check if your organisation is accredited or not on our accredited organisation page here. The FAQ that follows will help answer any questions you have as to whether your organisations use is professional. Today we have made possible for organisations who would like to assist Scoop's campaign to pledge towards our "Opening The Election" crowd-funding campaign in return for discounted six-month professional use licences - provided as a PledgeMe rewards. The special licenses come in four sizes, at never to be repeated introductory prices: - tiny, up to 3 staff, $75 (usually $210) - small, up to 50 staff, $200 (usually $420) - medium, up to 500 staff, $400 (usually $600-$1000) - large, up to 2000 staff. $600 (usually $1000-$1500) Bottom line, it costs money to maintain Scoop.co.nz, and at present those costs are not being met. We have to recover those costs – or shut up shop. We have deployed and marketed what we think is an equitable and fair way to do this, and 140 New Zealand organisations have already agreed to contribute. We hope you and your organisation will swiftly join them. The nature of the news crisis is such that unless businesses and professional organisations take responsibility for their need to support the provision of quality information services, they will find themselves in the dark. An FAQ For ease of use the remainder of this message is in FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) format. I trust this will assist in answering any specific questions you may have. Scoop Professional Use - FAQ QUESTIONS: Who is a professional user of Scoop? What is Scoop's Ethical Paywall? Who is required to pay to use Scoop? Who is not required to pay to use Scoop? How many professional Scoop users are there? How many Scoop contributors are there? Why don't you just charge organisations for submitting press releases? What are Scoop's financial circumstances? What will Scoop do with additional money? I am happy to answer any further questions you have via email on alastair@scoopmedia.co.nz. And finally, if you are not the correct person in your organisation to address this message to. Please send it on to them. Kind Regards Alastair Thompson ********* >> Scoop is Crowdfunding for its Election 2017 Coverage – Pledge Now << >> Scoop is Crowdfunding for its Election 2017 Coverage – Pledge Now << Scoop Professional Use - FAQ ANSWERS ********* Who is a professional user of Scoop? You or your organisation are a professional users of Scoop if you either rely on us regularly to access timely information and news, or you rely on us to publish your press releases to our broad and influential readership of 500,000 readers each month. ********* What is Scoop's Ethical Paywall? Scoop's terms and conditions of use require professional users of Scoop to purchase a Scoop End User [Organisation] Licence. The licence fees depend on the size of the organisation and start at $420 per year. We call it an "Ethical Paywall" because business users who obtain direct benefit from our service are paying for the costs of providing access to a high quality news service to the general public. As many of these organisations are also submitting us their press releases; and benefiting from our publication of them to our readership, there is a win-win outcome for the public interest from this arrangement. The word Ethical is derived from "Fair Trade" commerce where a disadvantaged part of the supply chain is addressed. In this case there are two disadvantaged parts to the news supply chain. News consumers who would otherwise not have access to news and news producers who would otherwise be unable to support their operations. Scoop's "Ethical Paywall" is a world first. You can read more about it in this presentation made to the Law Librarians association. ********* Who is required to pay to use Scoop? Scoop's ethical paywall applies to organisations whose staff routinely use Scoop.co.nz content as part of their professional working roles. If staff in your organisation: - read Scoop to keep informed about what is going on in your area of business; - read Scoop to keep informed about your competitors activities; - search Google for material related to work, and regularly access material from Scoop's large database; - subscribes to a paid media-monitoring service or subscriber newsletter which provides you with links to Scoop material; - send us press releases for publication and then link to them in social media and email links to contacts. Then you or your organisation requires a professional use license. ********* Who is not required to pay to use Scoop? You are not required to have a licence to use Scoop if: - You are a member of the public who accesses Scoop in your own time for the purposes of being well informed; - Your organisation is a purely voluntary organisation; - You are a student; ********* How many professional Scoop users are there? Scoop's Google analytics[*] tell us Scoop is read by between 60,000 and 70,000 New Zealand readers each week, 300,000 each month. 75% of Scoop's web traffic occurs during work hours – from 8am to 6pm. It is probable that a portion of the out-of-hours use of Scoop – including readers on mobile phones 40% of total traffic – is also work related. Last week Scoop's New Zealand based readers accessed the website from 1300 different network domains, including 987 ".nz" and 95 ".com". The vast bulk of these domains belong to places of work with dedicated networks. Last week's domains included, 44 academic institutions, 4 Crown Research Institutes, 48 Govt agencies, 584 different .co.nz domains, 213 .net.nz domains and 33 .org.nz domains. Last week Scoop's New Zealand readers accessed 24,544 unique pages. As roughly 4000 pages are published each month, this indicates heavy use of Scoop's database of older material, being accessed for research purposes, [*] Google Analytics can only identify details about traffic from domains that are identified. ********* How many Scoop contributors are there? Scoop has 23,000 different organisational names in its byline database. Over the past two years we have compiled a list of the people who regularly submit us professional content to publish. As of today that list has 4889 names and email addresses on it. As many of these people are from PR agencies they can represent more than one organisation. ********* Why don't you just charge organisations for submitting press releases? It is true that there are many online services that charge for either publishing or distributing press releases. Scoop does not do so as it is the comprehensiveness of our content stream that makes our service useful and which attracts the large and influential audience that encourages people to submit content to us. In addition, if we were to charge for the publication of Press Releases we would no longer be curating them on the basis of their being newsworthy. I.E. it is because Scoop does not charge for publishing press releases that we are able to both obtain and curate a set of press releases which is useful to the public, and the publication and archival of which is in the public interest. Organisations can however pay for have social media links, logos and additional information about their organisation to be added to all their releases. Scoop is presently considering providing a basic level of this Infopages service to accredited organisations. >> Scoop is Crowdfunding for its Election 2017 Coverage – Pledge Now << >> Scoop is Crowdfunding for its Election 2017 Coverage – Pledge Now << ********* What are Scoop's financial circumstances? Details of Scoop's financial circumstances were disclosed in my "Appeal To All Friends Of Scoop" published last week. This was also published in the form of an FAQ. Why don't you just cut costs & stem the losses? Why should Scoop receive public support at all? Why can't you support yourselves with commercially derived revenue? Spinoff.co.nz and NewsRoom.co.nz are getting money, why aren't you? How is the Ethical Paywall going then? Ok then, but what about now? How big is the shortfall now? Ahem, how big is the shortfall? Executive Summary: After two years of transitioning from advertising to a fully subscription and license based business model we are 90% of the way to achieving break-even. Our business development team believes we are around 100 licence sales away from achieving sustainability. ********* What will Scoop do with additional money it earns? As Scoop returns to sustainability, and eventually to profit, it will reinvest funds in improving the service provided to users. We would like to increase our editorial staff and publish more original journalism. We also have a backlog of technical improvements to make the website more attractive, accessible and useful for readers. At present 40% of Scoop's readers are accessing the site via phone or tablet, and improving the reading performance for these users is a priority. Thanks to public donor support this work has started in recent months with the first fruit being the launch of a new mobile friendly Scoop website - in Beta – at m.scoop.co.nz. The new website makes use of Google's accelerated mobile pages technology and is blisteringly fast. In coming months we will migrate mobile traffic directly to the new mobile website. And once Scoop is profitable it will return dividends to the Scoop Foundation for Public Interest Journalism, which will in turn provide grants to, and support activities that encourage the practice of public interest journalism. >> Scoop is Crowdfunding for its Election 2017 Coverage – Pledge Now << >> Scoop is Crowdfunding for its Election 2017 Coverage – Pledge Now << ENDS © Scoop Media Alastair Thompson Scoop Publisher Alastair Thompson is the co-founder of Scoop.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

The numbers were pretty impressive. Google claimed that its TPU was roughly 15 times faster than an unspecified GPU (which we took to mean a Tesla) when running inference tasks, and a whopping 30 to 80 times better when it came to performance-per-watt. As the CEO of a prominent GPU vendor, it was only natural that Nvidia's Jen-Hsun Huang would want to weigh in on the performance numbers that Google shared. Nvidia agrees with Google on a lot of points, namely the fact that the existence of dedicated hardware is what makes many modern AI applications scalable at all. However, Huang notes that the Google engineers compared their TPU to a now-outdated Kepler-based Tesla K80, which was allegedly never really optimized for handling AI-related tasks. He proceeds to point out that the contemporary Tesla P40 (based on the Pascal architecture) "delivers 26x [the K80's] deep-learning inferencing performance." With those facts in mind, Nvidia produced a chart quantifying the performance leap from the K80 to the P40 in both training and inference tasks, and estimating where Google's TPU fits in the picture. Right off the start, it's easy to spot one caveat: Google's TPU isn't meant to run training tasks, explaining the "NA" in the appropriate table cell. However, despite the huge performance boost of the P40 versus the old K80, the fact remains that the TPU still comes out almost twice as fast as the modern Tesla in integer teraops (at 90 versus 48). Nvidia didn't note performance-per-watt figures in the charts, though. Those figures likely to wouldn't make even the modern Tesla look particularly good with the tested workload. What this data amounts to is a little unclear. In our view, analyzing the performance of dedicated ASIC versus a general-purpose GPU is a flawed comparison to begin with—and one that doesn't even make the Tesla card look all that good in this specific instance. With that said, developing an ASIC and probably-specialized software to go with it isn't something that's even as remotely easy as just buying a Tesla card and hitting Nvidia's extensive HPC software library. The only moral in this story seems to be "pick the hardware that suits your needs." Tags: Miscellaneous Servers Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

PSA: You can control YouTube playback with OK Google voice commands Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2016/08/20 5:39am PDTAug 20, 2016 109 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 21 Share on Twitter Total Shares243 Applications Google Google Now has a tendency to add voice commands without most people noticing. Besides the few listed in-app, Google hides most of its commands, perhaps the most useful ones. For example, Google's voice actions have been integrated and implemented within YouTube, so you can control video playback with your mi... wait, no that's the next update. To get started, just start playing any video in the YouTube app. Then you can use any of these voice commands, triggered by the "OK Google" keyword, provided you have enabled its detection from any screen: "Pause" - Pauses the video. "Play" - Resumes the video. "Stop" - Stops the video and quits buffering, works exactly like switching to another app and switching back. "Minimize" - Moves the video to the tiny window at the bottom right. "Maximize" - Makes the video full screen. "Exit", "Close player" - Closes the video, but leaves YouTube open. "Play on...", "Connect to..." - Starts playing the video on another device, choices are "TV", "Chromecast", or "Console." Unfortunately, you can't seem to be able to say the name of the device (such as a Chromecast's name). "Disconnect from..." - The opposite of the last command, stops playing the video on a remote device. "Skip ads" - Somewhat self-explanatory. You may ask yourself, "Why would I waste precious seconds talking to my phone instead of pressing a button?" I can actually think of many uses for these commands. If you're doing something where your hands are tied up, like following a cooking video or a car-repair tutorial, being able to tell the phone to pause or play the video with your voice is helpful. If you're driving and using the YouTube app for music playback, using voice commands for playback control is much safer than looking down at your phone. We're not sure when exactly these commands started being functional; our best guess is sometime in 2016. Cody had discovered their existence long before, more than a year ago, in a YouTube teardown, but they weren't working then. Some of you may already be using these commands, others may be hearing about them for the first time now, so that's why we think they're worth highlighting again.

Because that attitude is how you get paywalls all over the Internet. Ad supported content is a very consumer friendly proposition if you ask me... Patryk ˙ ͜ʟ˙ Gregory The only thing ads do to me is annoy me. They don't serve their intended purpose for me since I don't at all care about brands and all such things, and I never buy things I don't actually need. All of that persuasiveness just simply doesn't work with me. Why waste advertisers' money on somebody who ads don't work with? And before you say about paywalls once again, no, they're not at all required to make money off of every single user. Just let me opt out of all this nonsense altogether already. Aaron "...companies are not at all required to make money off of every single user." But companies are required to make money, or else they won't be companies for long before going bankrupt. So how would you suggest that companies determine which users to monetize? You're not special. Nobody likes or pay attention to the ads. It's not just you. Ronak Gandhi The idea behind ads is not to make you purchase the product at that moment. They just want to plant the brand name/product in a corner of your brain so that it pops up next time you're buying something in the same category. So you're still a target customer. Sunny Oceans Clearly you haven't heard about marketing you idiot. It's these ads that make everything else free when your little twat of a brain ain't no want no subscription or payment for a product you so shamelessly pirate from a company. Gregory They will still break even if they will make money off, say, 1/3 of users. That's not an excuse, and please, don't call people idiots when you're not sure they really are ones. Since when having some critical sense is considered to be a trait of an idiot, you little twat? I've always thought the opposite. pfmiller Do you get to watch the YouTube video you want without having to pay for it? If so the ad served its intended purpose for you. And as other mentioned, the ad works by making you familiar with the brand name. People subconsciously conflate familiarity with trust, so they tend to choose the product with the name they recognize when shopping, even if they don't remember where they know it from. Gregory I said that I don't care about brands, because I really don't. I'm so happy I at least have AdBlock on my computer so I can enjoy the internet without ever thinking about those money things. I mean, come on, I'm already blocking ads, so I generate no revenue whatsoever. Why don't just "legalize" ad blocking by offering a way to opt out of ads, for free? Tav-El How would they make money, smartass? Look, I want a moneyless society more than anyone, but this is capitalism. I'm not sure how you expect them to just give you shit for free. When you go into McDonald's to flip burgers, do you say to your boss, "nah, don't worry about it. I work for free"? You want free stuff, but I bet you don't want to give away free stuff yourself. Gregory Here's the twist: I actually do want to give free stuff myself, and I don't want to make money off of everything that can potentially earn me something; I'm not greedy. Yes people do need to pay the bills and such, but that hardly makes an excuse to make more money than one can spend. But the point of that comment is, they already are not making any money off me, so that wouldn't change if they introduce an official way to opt out of ads. I'm pretty sure that even with this thing in place, they will still make enough money to at least break even. Tav-El What you're suggesting is laughably naïve. Can you imagine the logistics that would go into supporting an ad campaign that makes "enough money to at least break even?" No one is going to just try to get by. That's what poor people do, and it fucking sucks. Everybody's going to be making as much money as they possibly can, to live as well as they possibly can, and I legitimately don't believe that you're any different. You're also not really listening to other posters who are trying to tell you that companies ARE making money off of you. Do you buy laundry detergent? If you don't, let's just say you do for the sake of this scenario. You say you don't care about brands, but your subconscious does. When you go to the store, your eyes automatically gravitate towards Tide once you reach the detergent aisle, because that's what you know. You've never heard of "DuperClean Detergent" brand, so why the hell would it even cross your mind to grab it? I bet you literally don't even see it, because you've seen commercials for Tide more than anyone else. That's what commercials do, they condition you to recognize their brand so your subconscious mind, which—sorry to burst your bubble, but you actually don't have super powers, and can't actually ignore—will command you to choose that one. Bottom line: nobody is in the business of just breaking even. PLUS, this method would absolutely TANK THE ECONOMY, and we'd all have to move to the slums. It's all a give and take. That's really all the economy is: I do work for you, you give me money; I give you money, you give me product or service. You thinking it works any other way leads me to believe that you're about nine years old. Gregory No I don't want to make as much money as I can. I stop chasing money-making opportunities once I make enough to break even. I sincerely hate everything luxury. And I just want to make this world a better place to live. And that also includes convincing people that greed is evil, because else we'll be stuck in that massive clusterf**k forever. I don't really remember when was the last time I've seen a commercial. I don't watch TV, I don't listen to radio, and I have an ad blocker in my browser. The only ads I see are the billboards on the street, and I don't really pay attention to them, they're just a part of the urban landscape. And yes, for me, there's absolutely no difference between Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. I completely control my decisions, I never do impulse purchases and I've never ever been in debt in my entire life. Tav-El Well, congratu-fucking-lations, you've transcended humanity. But for the rest of us stupid mother-fuckers, we need a way to keep our economy going, so this is what we've chosen. Since you're separate from us, trying to change us into your warped perspective of society is insulting, so I would ask you kindly to fuck off. You don't matter. You don't spend money? Then no one cares about you, so your opinion is irrelevant. If you're not going to contribute to society then you have ZERO business commenting on how we run it. Gregory If money is the only thing you can contribute to the society besides that 9-to-5 job you hate, I'm really sorry for you. Ah and yes, having some critical sense while living among greedy people is really great. Too bad you will never experience that. Tav-El Work is how we contribute to society since we don't have your superpowers. Funny, I haven't heard any stories of Supergregory flying into burning buildings and saving babies. They must have reported it on another channel. There's a difference between greed and just not being a completely useless hermit like you. Have fun in your dreamworld. I think I'll keep my mind firmly grasped on reality. Gregory May I ask, how exactly did you come to the conclusion that I'm useless? Tav-El You don't contribute money to society, and you've not provided me with examples of how else you might contribute, so you're useless. Pretty simple formula. Keep in mind that literally paying for things is only the most obvious way of supporting the economy. It's far more complicated than that, and starts with having a job, ya bum! But I can't expect a nine-year-old hermit to understand. Gregory I don't care about economy, and still don't understand why I should. If you're so concerned, I was, for several years, the only developer of an app that is used by some 50 million users. And I had to quit my job because the company had been acquired and had its management changed, so instead of focusing on making great products they focused on making money for the sake of making money. So, what's your contribution to the society, may I ask now?! Tav-El I just work in a mailroom. I'm not some kind of world leader, but I do my part, and I'm trying to do more. You gave up. You're exactly what I thought you were. You just agreed that you don't care about the economy, which sounds like it's fine for you, but if we all did that, this world would end up in chaos. We don't want that, because we have a different perspective. We actually like civilization, and most of us even want others to be happy, and want the world to be better. We're not selfish assholes like you. So again, fuck off. Gregory I "gave up" only because the company I worked for stopped being the company I had pleasure to work for. It stopped making the world better, it just joined that clusterfuck of greed. I didn't give up, that acquisition wasn't my fault in any way, it just happened. I made my choice, and I'm happy with it. How I am selfish if I want to contribute things to the society without asking anything in exchange? All you're doing in this conversation is trying to make me blindly accept some "facts" and then fuck off, while I'm at least trying to be somewhat logical. Tav-El You're selfish because you're feeding on the money you made from the deal, and now you don't do anything with your life. You just sit on the computer reading news articles. You say you "contribute things to the society without asking anything in exchange" but sitting at home posting comments is decidedly NOT contributing. João Victor Schiavo You are a pain in the ass. Tav-El Yeah, I'm sure it was real hard for you to passively read my comments without anyone putting a fucking gun to your head. I've had a really terrible day, and I would like to thank you for putting the icing on the cake for absolutely no reason, you fucking cunt. This guy made all the money he needs, so he's set up for life, and now he expects everyone to follow suit even though they haven't made that much money, and just stop working altogether. That makes no sense. Adam Margeson and I've never ever been in debt in my entire life. I remember those days. And then I got a wife and kid. If you can manage that without touching debt (including any credit card whatsoever), then either you're a liar or you're a snobby 0.01% rich kid. Either way, that doesn't pay the bills of the services you're using. I despise advertising, too, but that's how we all get to use all these great services for free. Being an independant thinker that is not influenced by advertising doesn't solve the economic problem. Gregory You're not required to have kids. It's all about choice. I chose to be childfree. Adam Margeson Even if you don't end up with a child or even a wife, just buying a house is major debt. If you managed to get enough out of your company with enough to buy a house outright, then la de da! Good for you! The rest of us who have to work for a living don't have that option. And before you say, "Rent!" that's just a waste of money. JasperTree You can, just pay for youtube red. Its pretty straightforward Bill DeWall i actually make a list of every prodicy being advertised in those annoying ads, and then i promise myslef to boycott it Bill DeWall >implying that jewtube red is not a paywall hey i got news for you , youtube functioned just fine without a paywall or ads till the greedy jews sergi brin larry page and eric schmidt bought it and ruined it and now started blocking ABP cause they are greedy F-ing jews who just want to jew everyone into paying them mo shekels for a jewtube red sub a few months ago i able to get background play on my iphone and listen to youtube music videos with my phone turned off now without even updating the app it's all gone and i get no background play ,just pop-ups asking me to sub to jew tube red youtube has functioned for the last 11 years without having to jew people into a red subscription , these k!kes are just to F-ing greedy joshed I prefer the model of ad-supported with the option to pay to remove ads. Тарас Мукин "You've successfully subscribed to YouTube Red" "Do you want to change phone's name to «For free»?" Captain_Invisible I wish it was that easy. I would gladly pay for YouTube Red, but I'm not in the US with an American credit card. Bill DeWall WTF ,i had no ads in youtube till today, i'm using ABP is this something new , are they forcing ads now to try and jew us out of shekels for a jewtube red subsctiption? fifarunnerr I didn't knew about YouTube, but some similar commands do work for Spotify and have been for a couple of months. A few examples: "Skip this song" / "Next Song" "Pause" "Resume" SirWoggles I wonder if you can ask Google to find and start playing a video. That would make these commands even more useful. Никита Кабаков yes.. that is old SirWoggles really? thanks for bringing that to my attention. Juan David Ok, Google,... "play videos from [xxx]" Capt4chris I use voice commands like this on my Xbox One all the time. This will be very nice and even more so if they make it work system-wide so it works with any streaming app. Suicide_Note I tried, but found the commands too unreliable. I'd have to give a command three or four times before the Xbone would follow through. Eventually I just disconnected the Connect altogether. Capt4chris Hm, sounds like you would benefit from doing the microphone calibration. I find it mostly reliable. Suicide_Note I did that several times, but still found things not responsive enough. I don't mind though, because I get things done just fine without the voice commands. :) Abhishek Saral It is not working for me when I say minimize it just gives me the definition of the word "minimize"! LOL surethom Thats OK Google for you, only works some of the times or not at all. Roll on google assistance, hopefully it will be way better & more reliable. Joel Anderson Chromecast also works from anywhere on the device. For instance, "play Red Hot Chili Peppers on my Chromecast" opens YouTube and starts casting. Armando Saldierna How do you get it to choose which chromecast? I have two on my network. Tj Hariharan Doesn't for me :(. all it does is give me a link to open the (now) "Google Home" app C64 Waiting for the first sex doll with OK Google voice control JasonIvers I just want them to add 'like this song' for Google Play Music. My car can already pause, play, skip, etc., but I have no way to like some while I'm driving. distortedloop All I want from YouTube is a freakin' 10 second back and forward skip button. Trying to rewind a few seconds to catch something you missed is a tedious chore with nothing but that damned slider to work with. I'd settle for a voice command to do that if nothing else. Josh G If you hadn't noticed the new feature by now, you can double tap on either side of the player and it will skip 10 seconds. surethom Roll on Google assistance / Google Home, I find OK Google not very useful & it seems to always fail. OK Google, "turn off light Bulbs Lifx" works like 20% of the time, & does not work with Philips hue. Also ask so may questions that still just shows a web page. Anyone know when google assistance will be released? newboyx These also work in Google Play Music Jacob Fulbright Does it work while casting? Because that would be YUGE!!! I would love to be able to say "Okay Google, pause" instead of fumbling with my phone. SOMFW Maybe it's just my POS nexus 6p, but commands while watching YouTube Don't work. Screaming or whispering the mic doesn't function while a video, music etc are playing. So, saying "OK google" during a YouTube session is an exorcise in futility.

The shock finding has prompted the launch of a campaign to curb the power of the two web giants, which critics are saying are becoming a duopoly. PA:Press Association 3 Web giants to grab 70 per cent of online ad spend by 2020 Press Gazette, the trade website for newspapers and magazines, said: “Imagine if two news publishers dominated digital media in the way that Facebook and Google do. “The Government would not allow such a duopoly to stand. Campaigners would call for them to be broken up in the name of media plurality.” By 2020 Google and Facebook are expected to take 71 per cent of all the money spent in the UK on digital advertising, according to a report by analysts OC&C. Alamy 3 Critics claim that the ‘duopoly’ will spell disaster for journalism The UK advertising market was worth around £20billion in 2015. In the last ten years the share of that going to newspaper – local, regional and national – has gone from half to about a tenth. US man shot by cop livestreams his last moments on Facebook Press Gazette said: “This is money which had been spent on journalists holding those in power to account has been transferred to two US-owned digital platforms which exist purely to exploit content rather than create it. “News publishers are reaching more people than ever before both directly, via their websites, and indirectly, via social media. "But they are getting an ever shrinking slice of the advertising pie. This has a direct impact on the number of journalists they are able to employ.” Getty Images 3 Critics claim that too much market share sits with platforms that 'exist purely to exploit content' “The effect of this can already be seen and is devastating for both the news industry and for society in general. “That’s why Press Gazette is today launching its Duopoly campaign which aims to stop Facebook and Google destroying any more of the UK journalism industry. “There is no simple solution, but broadly we are seeking a fairer deal between news publishers and the digital giants – one which fairly rewards the creators of the content on which these platforms rely.” Google Maps adds real-time location tracker The Sun Topics advertising Facebook Google Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Popular thin RED LINE Russia and Iran pledge to hit back against further Syria strikes as they blast US for 'crossing red lines' News VAPE WARNING New vaping laws to come into force restricting sale of e-liquids and e-cigarettes News BLAST FROM THE PAST Cheryl 'in tears' after ex husband Ashley Cole sends his best wishes to her and Liam Payne TV & Showbiz GORDON'S FORTUNE NIGHTMARE Gordon Ramsay won't leave his four children a penny of his £113million fortune as he fears… TV & Showbiz tanks a bullion!

Janette Wipper, a Department of Labor regional director, said her investigators "found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce" within the web ads giant. She was speaking in court on Friday during an ongoing legal battle between the US government and Google. Those comments drew sharp criticism from the tech goliath, which told The Register the official's comments were "unfounded." "We vehemently disagree with Ms Wipper's claim. Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap," a Google spokesperson said. "Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn't provided any data or shared its methodology." The DoL sued Google earlier this year seeking to get its hands on the details of the Chocolate Factory's salary structure to ensure compliance with federal laws on equal pay. Google countered by claiming not only is it in compliance with the laws, but has closed the pay gap entirely: Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Internet Image Source: wrightliving.com Facebook and Google reveal how they plan to fight fake news Chris Smith @chris_writes April 9th, 2017 at 12:00 PM Share Tweet Facebook and Google have had a significant role in the spread of fake news, facing plenty of criticism last year after the US presidential election since fake news is believed to have had a huge impact on the result. Neither Facebook nor Google actively contributed to disseminating fake news. Seemingly motivated by financial or political gain, some people and organizations took advantage of the way Facebook and Google work and used the services to spread fake news. But both companies have promised to fight the phenomenon, separately announcing measures meant to combat that viral lies that are told online. Don't Miss: There’s only one thing keeping all these iPhone users from switching to the Galaxy S8 Google on Friday announced a new product called Fact Check that will be available in Search and News. Google itself will not verify the accuracy of reports, but the company created the “Fact Check” tag to identify news reports as having been fact-checked by other news publishers and fact-checking organizations. Image Source: Google The Fact Check label will appear everywhere in Search and in News, and users will be able to spot fact-checked stories immediately, as seen in the image above. Naturally, not all news reports out there will be fact-checked. But the kind of viral stories that turn out to be fake may be fact-checked by people looking to stop the spread of misinformation. Facebook, in turn, is also looking to curb the spread of false news within its social network. The company explained that it’s been focusing on three areas, including the disruption of economic incentives for fake news creators to push such stories, new products to stop the spread of fake news, and helping people make more informed decisions when they see potential fake news. Image Source: Facebook One of the measures meant to stop fake news is the tool in the image above, an educational project intended to help people spot fake stories. The tool will be located at the top of the News Feed for a few days in 14 countries. Additionally, Facebook promised to continue its work in all the three key areas it identified, in an effort to put a stop to fake news. Like Google, Facebook won’t interfere directly, but it’ll try to prevent fake news from going viral by informing Facebook users how to avoid fake news, and by making it harder for fake news creators to make money off their viral stories. Facebook will also work with other partners to try to prevent fake news from going viral.

But the centre of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada's young AI scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of AI startups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills and optimism are abundant. "Canada is not really reaping the benefits from this AI technical leadership and decades of investment by the Canadian government," said Tiff Macklem, former senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, who is dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. Now bringing AI home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country's expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country. And they want to build on the tenacity of veteran researchers like Geoffrey Hinton, Richard Sutton and Yoshua Bengio, who developed techniques that opened the door to remarkable improvements in an AI technology called machine learning, even as many computer scientists and the tech industry considered their work to be an unpromising backwater. There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture startups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and U.S. venture capitalists. In its recent budget, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged $125 million to support AI research centers in Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton, which will be public-private collaborations. The Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Toronto, announced two weeks ago, will be one of them. The institute begins with commitments of $130 million, about half the money coming from the national and provincial governments and the other half from corporate sponsors like Google, Accenture and Nvidia, as well as big Canadian companies like the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and Air Canada. Hinton, who was hired by Google in 2013 but remains a professor at the University of Toronto, will serve as its chief scientific adviser. The new institute will be in the MaRS Discovery District, a cluster of buildings in downtown Toronto, run by a public-private partnership, that is home to many tech startups including AI companies. Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are adding to their AI research teams in Canada.           The experience of two startups applying AI technology to drug discovery illustrate the challenges — and the opportunities — facing Canadian startups. Atomwise, a company that uses AI technology to predict what new molecules might combat specific diseases like multiple sclerosis, was founded in 2012. Its chief executive, Abraham Heifets, earned his PhD in computer science from the University of Toronto. When Heifets sought funding, he recalled, one potential Canadian investor said people had tried the same thing 20 years ago. "What could possibly be new?" Heifets said the investor had asked, and turned him down. Later, Heifets went to the Bay Area and met with Timothy Draper, founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Draper observed that he had invested in a couple of companies trying a similar approach 20 years ago. That didn't deter him from trying again. "That's a cultural issue, a different appetite for risk and willingness to accept failure," Heifets said. Atomwise moved to San Francisco to be close to its investors and the region's enormous talent pool. By contrast, Deep Genomics, founded in 2014, has stayed in Canada, and its U.S.-based venture backers encouraged it to remain in Toronto. CEO Brendan Frey studied under Hinton at the University of Toronto, and he has spent years on research that combines deep-learning AI and cell biology. When he hires software engineers, he asks them to make multiyear commitments. "There are a lot of distractions in the Bay Area," said Frey, who is also a professor at the university and a co-founder of the new Vector institute. "The hype is a little too hot down there. Besides, we have some of the best talent in the world here."   Both Atomwise and Deep Genomics were participants in different years in a program called the Creative Destruction Lab. Founded in 2012 by Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the Rotman School, the lab was set up to help technology-intensive startups. They are typically founded by a PhD scientist who has worked on an idea for five years, but has little or no business experience. In 2015, the program tilted toward AI startups, with 25 companies admitted. Last year, 50 AI startups were admitted, and this year will likely have 75, Agrawal said.         One of the X factors in Canada's drive to develop an AI industry is the Trump administration. Canadian AI scientists say they have received a stream of inquiries from U.S. researchers, concerned about the new administration's stance on immigration and other policies. Should there be a northward migration it wouldn't the first time. Hinton settled in Canada in 1987 in part because of the United States' clandestine support for the Contra guerrillas who sought to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.     New York Times | Most Read SEE MORE Clairmont: Paul Maynard found a dead body and then he found himself alone News anchor learns of husband’s death on live TV Barrie man allegedly punches manager in face during first day on job Likely murder-suicide at California elementary school kills 2 adults, 1 student Teen who faked her death faces charges in 11-year-old boy’s suicide In Your Neighbourhood Today The perfect recipe for a family gathering Anniversaries tend to bring people together, especially when it's a big milestone — and Catelli...

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

Brian Feroldi, Anders Bylund, and Matthew DiLallo (TMFTypeoh) Apr 10, 2017 at 3:38PM Finding winning stocks is tough. That's why we Fools tend to hold on tenaciously when we think we have bought a winner. So what stocks do we currently own that we plan on holding forever? We asked that very question to a team of Fools, and they picked Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Brookfield Property Partners (NYSE:BPY), and MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX). Image source: Getty Images. Google is growing up into a cross-sector conglomerate Anders Bylund (Alphabet): " Never" is a very long time, but I certainly don't have any plans to sell my holdings in Alphabet for the foreseeable future. The company is best known for its Google-branded range of online tools and services today. Through Google, Alphabet dominates the lucrative fields of online search and advertising. YouTube is another market-defining property under the Google umbrella. The Android platform for smartphones and tablets also dominates its industry on a global level, again under Google's aegis. It's safe to say that you know what the company does, and you probably use its services every day. The Google segment provided 99% of Alphabet's total revenue in the recently reported fourth quarter. In short, Alphabet is Google. And with Google's sales rising 22% year over year, driving operating income 17% higher, that's not a bad thing. But Alphabet won't look like that forever. The minuscule "other bets" segment is tiny and unprofitable today but represents Alphabet's long-term future. The internet as we know it may go away as quickly as it rose out of nowhere in the 1990s, replaced by whatever comes next. (No, I can't tell you what that might be. If I knew, I'd be getting rich developing that idea rather than talking about the current state of affairs. Sorry.) So Alphabet is getting ready for the day when online search and marketing no longer supports a strong business foundation. Other bets include self-driving cars, advanced medical research, the Google Fiber high-speed internet service, and the Nest line of smart thermostats. Beyond these familiar names, Alphabet is working up many more not-so-obvious business ideas out of the public eye. Any or all of these experiments may turn into profitable businesses one day, and the Alphabet company was designed to contain many long-term bets on the far future. Some of the so-called moonshots contain an online element, but others don't. In short, Alphabet is remaking itself as a whole new kind of industry-spanning conglomerate. With or without the internet, Alphabet will be around for the very long haul. The company is just getting started, using Google to kindle the fires under a brand new bundle of growth engines. A core real estate holding Matt DiLallo (Brookfield Property Partners): I'm a firm believer that investors should hold some form of real estate for the long term. The numbers back up this view, as investors who added real estate or other alternatives to a portfolio of stocks and bonds have significantly outperformed those holding a more traditional portfolio over the long term. While there are plenty of good ways to get into real estate, the best, in my opinion, is by investing in Brookfield Property Partners. The real estate partnership owns a core portfolio of office properties in gateway cities around the world and a significant stake in leading U.S. mall owner General Growth Properties (NYSE:GGP). In addition, it has investments in several opportunistic real estate funds that hold stakes in a variety of other property classes, including multi-family, industrial, and hospitality. That makes it a one-stop shop for real estate investing. These real estate portfolios throw off very predictable cash flow, 80% of which Brookfield Property Partners distributes back to investors through a generous payout currently yielding 5.3%. Meanwhile, the company reinvests the other 20% into redevelopment projects to obtain higher rents. The upside from those redevelopment projects, when combined with rent escalations and development projects in the pipeline, provide Brookfield with the ability to increase its payout by 5% to 8% annually over the long term. That steadily growing payout, along with capital appreciation across its portfolio, should drive 12% to 15% annual returns for investors over the long term, which is why this is one stock I'd never consider selling. This disruptor has a long runway ahead  Brian Feroldi (MarketAxess Holdings): Did you know that the majority of fixed-income trading still takes place over the phone or by email? Given the ubiquity of electronic trading in the stock market, I was shocked to uncover this fact. But now MarketAxess is attempting to bring the bond markets into the 21st century. The company operates the biggest online bond-trading platform in the world, making it easy for its users to buy, sell, or research fixed-income securities. Not only does this platform make far more sense than holding one-on-one conversations to transact, but it also brings a whole new level of transparency to this market.  Being the top dog in this small but growing niche provides MarketAxess with a big advantage. Just like every other marketplace, bond buyers and sellers will naturally gravitate toward the largest platform since it maximizes their chance of getting a good price on either side of the transaction. This network effect will make it nearly impossible for a potential rival to catch up. One big financial benefit of running an electronic trading platform is that it costs the company very little to add one more user. That means the company's margins can consistently expand over time, allowing profits to grow at a much faster rate than revenue. MKTX Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Over time, I'm convinced that the benefits of trading electronically will persuade more and more market participants to sign on the company's platform. With plenty of market share left for MarketAxess' to capture, I think the company's torrid revenue and profit growth rates should only continue from here. That why I plan on holding on to my MarketAxess shares indefinitely.    Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Currently, the suggestions support handbags, sunglasses, and shoes. Over the next few months Google will add support for other apparel, as well as home & garden items. ”Using machine vision technology, the Similar items feature identifies products in lifestyle images and displays matching products to the user.” In addition to suggesting similar items, Google is also adding a much requested feature by displaying information about price and availability. If you’re vendor and want to make your products show up in ‘Similar items’ suggestions, you have to ensure schema.org product metadata is added to the pages of all products you wish to include. All products with name, image, price & currency, and availability meta-data are eligible for inclusion. Next, if you haven’t already, verify the markup has been added correctly by testing your pages with the Structured Data Testing Tool. If the markup has been recently added, Google notes it may take up to a week for the information to be recrawled and added to search. You can test it in live search results by typing “site:yourdomain.com” into Image Search.

More specifically, it is using data collected from Gboard to personalize users’ search results. When Gboard suggests searches, the app will remember which ones were selected and which ones were not. That data will then be used to personalize the app’s search results on each individual’s device. Google will collect all of these personalized changes and aggregate them into a single new update to the app for all users. So if you use Gboard on Android, expect many updates going forward. However, you won’t have to wait for the new app update to start experiencing more personalized search suggestions. Your personalized algorithm will begin rolling out on the app immediately after data is collected. Although it sounds like there massive amount of personal information being collected, Google says it’s actually more private to do it this way. Data used to improve an individual’s app will never leave their phone. This is made possible thanks to a new method of AI training which the company calls “Federated Learning.” ”Federated Learning enables mobile phones to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all the training data on device, decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud.” Google says it has only “scratched the surface” of what is possible with Federated Learning. ”Beyond Gboard query suggestions, for example, we hope to improve the language models that power your keyboard based on what you actually type on your phone (which can have a style all its own) and photo rankings based on what kinds of photos people look at, share, or delete.” The process of collecting the data and issuing changes will not affect performance of the Gboard app or the phone’s battery life. Google says these things will only take place when the phone is plugged in, not being used, and on a free wireless connection.

Featuresby Robert Triggs9 hours ago 7 385 5 News earlier today suggests that Google is looking to sure up some additional OLED production over at LG with a cash boost of $880 million (1 trillion won). While unconfirmed by either party, the rumor suggests that at least one major smartphone manufacturer is becoming a little concerned about the display supply outlook over the coming year or more and there are several indications that an OLED supply crunch could be on the way. One of the largest potential contributing factors to a shortage of OLED availability is the upcoming iPhone 8. Apple has long been rumored to finally be making the move over from LCD to OLED display technology and, of course, such a move would immediate add millions of additional orders into the OLED supply chain. A report earlier in the year suggested that Apple would require around 14 percent of Samsung’s production capabilities to fulfill projected demand for its iPhone 8. See also: Global AMOLED and memory shortages predicted for 2017 November 10, 2016 Samsung is expected to be the sole display manufacturer for the iPhone 8, and Apple could take up 14 percent of the company's production capabilities. This would make it tough for other OEMs to find sufficient supply. Samsung is expected to be the sole display manufacturer for Apple’s iPhone 8, as it’s currently the largest small form factor OLED panel manufacturer. Samsung is estimated to use up about 56 percent of the market’s OLED panels for its range of Galaxy smartphones, including its Galaxy S flagships and A series mid-range phones. Between its own requirements and a big order from Apple, Samsung’s other partners, which include Oppo, Vivo, and others, may have increased competition for panel contracts. After accounting for its own demand and the Apple rumor, Samsung is estimated to only have enough capacity left for 50 million AMOLED panels for other manufacturers in the next year or so. This is likely behind Google’s decision to approach LG rather than the market leader. LG has been investing heavily to ramp up its OLED production line in order to catch up with Samsung, but there are likely still some supply contracts up for grabs. Google’s reported $880 million investment would be enough for LG to build a new production line dedicated to mobile panels. The company already has two flexible OLED plants, which LG has announced serious investments into already this year. It’s been suggested that Google’s request could be manufactured at the E5 plant in Gumi City, South Korea. LG is currently the largest manufacturer of large TV OLED panels, but it still catching up with Samsung’s lead in mobile panel sized production. Samsung currently accounts for 95 percent of mobile OLED market. With supply being snapped up by big players, we may not see as many small manufacturers, such as OnePlus, be able to secure OLED panels this year. The other major factor putting a squeeze on OLED supply is the falling production costs and improved yields, which have brought the costs of this technology down to the price of traditional LCD. Last year the prices between these two mobile display types became compatible, leaving mid-range manufacturers in particular with more options to consider. A number of lower cost smartphones have already shipped with OLED panels, but these have been quite reliant on excess supply from Samsung. The falling cost of OLED panels has increases OEM interest, which has put additional pressure on the supply chain. This extra demand from the mid-tier combined with major orders from big players is likely to reduce the availability of these panels, especially from the largest manufacturers. This is already having a knock-on effect for smartphone manufacturers. Asus is reportedly struggling to secure display supply from Samsung for its mid-range products. The company has instead turned to Chinese panel manufacturers like Tianma Micro-electronics and BOE Technology Group to find the units it needs. However, these panel producers aren’t expected to come online in a meaningful way until 2018, and even then yields will take time to bring production into full swing. According to industry reports, Oppo and Vivo have managed to secure supply from market leader Samsung, but Huawei has not been able to guarantee a share that meets the company’s requirements. If true, Huawei may be able to source additional units from other manufacturers or simply limit OLED technology to its flagship models, but it could also be faced with the choice of simply having to pick LCD instead. HTC is another major manufacturer rumored to be interested in picking up OLED technology for its handsets, but has been similarly out of luck. See also: Smartphones with AMOLED displays catching up on LCDs March 1, 2017 Samsung controls most of the supply, so a highly successful Galaxy S8 could leave a shortage for other OEMs and/or waiting times for some consumers. Overall, global OLED demand is expected to climb around 44 percent this year, meaning that the industry will need to produce some 530 million units throughout 2017 to avoid a shortage. Despite major investments, the supply chain isn’t expected to grow quickly enough to leave manufacturers the 10 percent buffer typically required to cater for any swings in demand. In other words, better than expected demand for a major smartphone release, such as the Galaxy S8 or iPhone 8, or factory issues could result in a supply shortage. For us consumers, a display supply shortage could mean a number of things. Firstly, that we may not see as many smaller manufacturers offering smartphones with OLED displays this year, as the larger manufacturers buy up supply contracts from Samsung. Although, smaller runs may still be able to find supply from some of the smaller Chinese display manufacturers. Secondly, a highly successful launch of the Galaxy S8 or the rumored OLED iPhone 8 could potentially lead to handset shortages. Of course these phones aren’t launching at the same time, and the companies will have set aside units and production capacity to cater for expected sales. However, we’ve seen companies have to delay launches in certain regions in the past when exceedingly high demand outstrips supply. Fortunately an OLED supply shortage should only be short lived, with a two year projection seemingly the worst case scenario. Samsung and LG are investing heavily in additional production lines that will increase output later in 2018. Furthermore, a number of Chinese panel manufacturers will be increasing their own output substantially in 2018 too, meaning that we could see a lot more OLED and AMOLED smartphones in the coming years.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

The paper cited unnamed sources as saying Google offered the investment to secure a stable supply of flexible Oled screens for its next Pixel smartphones. Samsung Electronics' flagship Galaxy smartphones use the bendable displays, while Apple is expected to start using them in at least some of its next iPhones. LG Display declined to comment, while Google could not be reached for comment. REUTERS Flipkart secures $2b in biggest fundraising MUMBAI • India's top e-commerce firm Flipkart has raised US$1.4 billion (S$1.97 billion) in its biggest fundraising to date as it takes on US tech giant Amazon for a larger share of the country's online retail market. Tencent Holdings, eBay and Microsoft participated in the funding round, Flipkart said in a statement yesterday, which will value the Indian company at US$11.6 billion, lower than the US$15 billion valuation it achieved at its 2015 fundraising. India is the world's fastest-growing Internet services market as a rising middle class increasingly shops online. Amazon announced last year it would invest over US$5 billion in India, and has recently expanded into online video and grocery shopping in the country.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News Spring Break Injuries Submit123PR | Press Release Service » Spring Break Injuries New York City, NY, 04/10/2017 /SubmitPressRelease123/ As the last few weeks of cold weather wrap up, many teens and college students are gearing up for a spring vacation. Although spring break can provide a much-needed respite from studying and other responsibilities, it can also lead to serious injuries, as well as complicated legal matters if you’re injured far away from home. Here are four spring break injuries to keep in mind, along with tips for avoiding them. 4 Common Spring Break Injuries Violent Crime – It’s an unfortunate fact that some popular tourist destinations are also burdened by high crime rates. In 2015, the Coca-Cola Company settled a lawsuit with a Texas college student who was violently attacked and nearly stabbed to death on a beach owned by the soft drink maker. Property Owner Negligence – Slips and falls and related injuries can happen anywhere, including parties and gatherings at homes, hotels, resorts, and other places. If your spring break plans include partying at a home or business, keep an eye out for potential hazards, including spills, loose carpeting or floor tiles, and a building that doesn’t have clearly marked exits.  In one of the most horrific nightclub disasters in U.S. history, 100 people were killed and 230 were injured when a fire broke out at a Rhode Island nightclub, completely engulfing the club in under five minutes. An investigation revealed that two of the four exits in the building had been chained shut, preventing people from escaping. The building also lacked a proper sprinkler system, as fire safety inspectors had incorrectly concluded that the building’s age exempted it from having sprinklers. Cruise Ship Injuries – A cruise can be a great way to enjoy a vacation without worrying about hotel rooms and transportation. However, there have been many cases involving allegations of negligence on the part of cruise operators. In 2017, about 30 passengers injured on a Spirit Cruise filed a lawsuit for damages they say they sustained when their cruise ship crashed into a dock. Drinking-Related Injuries – Data from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reveals that half of all college students engage in binge drinking, and a startling percentage of college students take binge drinking to an extreme during spring break, with the average male student drinking 18 drinks per day. New York City personal injury lawyer Jonathan C. Reiter states, “Excessive alcohol consumption can seriously alter a person’s judgment, causing them to engage in activities that endanger themselves and others. When you’re away from home or in an unfamiliar country or tourist spot, it’s best to avoid any substance that interferes with your ability to make good decisions.” If you have been injured on spring break or vacation, you may be facing a personal injury case that is more complicated than an injury case involving an accident in your home state. Contact a New York City personal injury lawyer right away to protect your rights and discuss the next steps in your case.

By: FE Online | Published: April 11, 2017 2:25 AM On the 130th birth anniversary of Roy, search engine giant Google placed an image inspired by his Black Horse painting. Jamini Roy, an Indian painter, has been honoured with a Google Doodle tribute on his birth anniversary celebrated on Aprill 11. On the 130th birth anniversary of Roy, search engine giant Google placed an image inspired by his Black Horse painting. The artist was born in 1887 into a moderately prosperous family of land-owners in Beliatore village of the Bankura district, West Bengal. From the age of sixteen, he started learning to paint initiating from drawing Classical nudes and painting in oils and in 1908 he received his Diploma in Fine Art from a Kolkata-based college. But when it was time for Roy to develop his style of art, he returned to the folk and craft of his homeland. Thus, he looked to the living folk and tribal art for inspiration. In creating his own world of art, Roy found inspiration in Kalighat pat (Kalighat paintings), traditional kanthas and alpanas. The use of bright colours with bold sweeping brush-strokes defined his art. The famous painter Roy, preferred himself to be called a ‘patua’. His paintings were put on the exhibition for the first time in the British India Street of Kolkata (then Calcutta) in 1938. Later his works crossed the national boundary and in 1946 it was exhibited in London followed by the New York City in 1953. His popular works include ‘Mother and the Child’, which is an image of a Santhal woman embracing her child. A bronze-bodied Santhal mother feeding an infant and outlined figures reflecting maternal love added a glorious chapter in the life of this master folk modernist. You may also like to watch: Jamini Roy, who died in 1972, received several honours including, Padma Bhushan in 1954 and Viceroy’s gold medal in an all India exhibition for one of his work in 1934, while in 1976, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Ministry of Culture, declared his works among the ‘Nine Masters’ whose work considered to be ‘art treasures.’ No Comments.

New devices have arrived ready to show off the software too. With sales still firmly in the less-than-spectacular bracket though, is a fancy new OS update going to be enough to convince users to pay for an Android Wear device? We took the Huawei Watch 2 out for some testing to see what Android Wear 2.0 has to offer. Popular Searches Macy's Inc M ▲ 29.52 +0.42 +1.44% Streamline Health Solutions Inc STRM ▲ 1.03 +0.05 +5.35% Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd FLI ▲ 21.49 +0.32 +1.51% National Australia Bank Limited NAB10 = 100.78 0.00 0.00% What's new in Android Wear 2.0? © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The biggest change ushered in with Android Wear 2.0 is that watches are much more independent - you install apps right from your wrist, for example, rather than relying on extensions built into the apps on your phone. So having Google Maps on your mobile isn't enough to have Google Maps on your smartwatch - with Android Wear 2.0 you need to install Google Maps separately on your wearable too. It's the same story with syncing tracks from Google Play Music to your wrist: this needs to be done from the watch itself now, not through the phone app. These tweaks make it much easier to get everything done from your smartwatch, but the new approach can take some getting used to for Android Wear 1.x veterans. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Other major upgrades include better text entry options, with support for smart replies, handwriting input and a tiny keyboard, and a cleaner user interface. Watch faces are also new and improved in Android Wear 2.0, with support for complications - tiny widgets that display shortcuts to apps of your choice, or perhaps data pulled from your calendar or Google Fit. Speaking of Google Fit, the watch experience is now much more comprehensive - with guided tutorials, for example - but the same updates have been pushed out to Android Wear 1.x too, so this isn't an update that's exclusive to the new software. Every Android Wear watch launched this year is going to come with version 2.0 of the software on board, and it's slowing rolling out to plenty of older watches too. Testing Android Wear 2.0: what we liked © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. There's no doubt the whole Android Wear experience is more polished with the 2.0 update, and we like a lot of what Google's done here. The interface is smarter and cleaner overall, and you're going to be checking your phone a lot less. Much of that is to do with the way apps now live independently on the watch. Getting directions or reading emails is a breeze, though beyond Google's own apps, not many developers have yet pushed out a full Android Wear 2.0 experience. In other words, for a lot of third-party apps, you're still going to have to fish out your phone once you've seen you've got an alert. Another new feature we haven't mentioned yet is Google Assistant - and though it's still got plenty of room for improvement, it's already one of the best features of Android Wear 2.0. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Much of what you can do with Google Assistant you could do with the old voice search and command interface, but the Assistant is smarter and more natural to work with. Voice recognition is very good too, so you don't need to shout at your wrist. Not everyone is going to make use of Google Assistant, but those that do will love the way it's baked into Android Wear 2.0. It's not perfect yet but there's a lot of potential here, as Google is now putting it into pretty much every product it makes. We really liked the complications as well, letting you see appointments and steps and lots of other data without even touching your watch. Based on the time we've spent with our Android Wear 2.0 watch, it's a big step forward - notifications are smarter, you're going to be spending less time digging out your phone, and it's focused on the simple stuff smartwatches do well. Testing Android Wear 2.0: what needs work © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. As we alluded to above, getting started with Android Wear 2.0 isn't all that easy if you're well used to the way Android Wear 1.x works. To begin with we were expecting apps (like Google Maps and Android Messenger) to just show up, but you actually need to install them on your wrist now. The new notification system is a bit hit and miss too: it's designed to be less intrusive, but depending on the watch face it can be difficult to tell if you've got any alerts at all. Watch faces in general seem to be a bit of a mess too - Android Wear 1.x faces won't automatically work on Android Wear 2.0 without a developer patch, and designs that have been updated don't necessarily work on all 2.0-compatible watches. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Meanwhile we're glad to see handwriting and keyboard support added - but they're pretty useless. That's not necessarily Google's fault, it's just the limitations of a very small screen. We spent many a frustrating minute trying to tap out replies to messages on our watch, and the "smart" replies weren't particularly helpful either (though handy in a pinch). Overall, Android Wear 2.0 ends up very much in credit, and a lot of the frustrations of Android Wear (like overbearing notifications) have been removed. The next steps are more advanced apps, more features for Google Assistant, and a stronger selection of watch faces (that work across any model) so users can really make Android Wear their own.

But that’s likely to change over the next few years, as banks, payment companies and even the likes of Google and Facebook push so-called peer-to-peer, or p2p, payment systems — a medium of exchange with revolutionary potential. The apps and online tools could someday overtake cash and checks as the primary way individuals pay each other, and they even could make inroads at the cash register and with businesses that send refunds and other payments to their customers. These systems will get a boost later this year when a coalition of the nation’s biggest banks roll out Zelle, a mobile and online money-transfer network that will let any customer of nearly every U.S. bank send money to customers of any other bank using only a phone number or email address. Analysts say the bank-led system — and the related marketing push — should bring online and mobile peer-to-peer payments to a larger audience. Even competitors, notably the popular money transfer app Venmo, say the Zelle rollout could boost their fortunes by making digital-money transfers more mainstream. “We don’t see it as a winner-take-all scenario,” said Josh Criscoe, a spokesman for Venmo owner PayPal. “We welcome any effort to move folks to more digital payments and move toward the smartphone as the central point of financial life. The common enemy is cash.” Online and mobile peer-to-peer payment systems have grown rapidly over the last few years, and analysts expect that to continue. In a report published in March, finance industry research firm Aite Group estimated that Americans made about $147 billion in digital p2p transfers last year, up from $100 billion the year before. Those are big numbers, to be sure, but last year’s sum still only accounted for about 12 percent of the more than $1.2 trillion that Americans paid each other that year, mostly in cash. That means there’s still plenty of growth ahead, said Talie Baker, an analyst at Aite Group. In her report, she estimated that the volume of digital p2p payments will more than double by 2020, topping $316 billion. “Not that many consumers are using mobile payments yet,” Baker said, noting that though these payments are more common among young consumers in big coastal cities, they’re not so ubiquitous elsewhere. “I’m a Gen-X person and I live in Denver — I hadn’t heard of Venmo until 2015.” There are plenty of players in the p2p game. Square Inc., the payments company behind the tiny white credit card reader that plugs into a smartphone, has a p2p service of its own, Square Cash, which launched in 2013. Following the geometric theme, there’s also Circle, a Boston firm that started the same year and specializes in cross-border p2p transfers in dollars, euros and British pounds. Facebook and Google, too, allow users to send money to friends. Google has Google Wallet, which started as a mobile wallet app but became a p2p payment tool in 2015, and Facebook users have been able to send money through Facebook Messenger since 2015. Square, Google and Facebook don’t report the volume of payments made through their p2p systems, but Facebook in regulatory filings has said that only “a relatively small percentage” of its users have used the payments feature. Venmo is arguably the biggest name in peer-to-peer transfers. It even has the coveted status, like Google, Uber and a few others, of becoming a verb — as in “Venmo me.” Founded in 2009, the company was acquired in 2012 by payment services provider Braintree, which was acquired the following year by online payments giant PayPal — which offers p2p payments under its own name too. But the biggest players in the market are still the banks. Last year, Venmo users transferred $17.6 billion. That’s more than double the volume from 2015, but it’s also much less than the $28 billion transferred in 2016 through QuickPay, JPMorgan Chase’s peer-to-peer payment system. And that’s just one bank. Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other major financial institutions have had their own p2p transfer programs for years, though it can sometimes be clunky for bank customers to send money to people with accounts at other financial institutions. Aite Group estimates that of all the digital p2p transfers Americans made last year, non-bank systems such as Venmo accounted for only about 17 percent of that. Banks accounted for the rest, though much of that likely was made through banks’ websites, not mobile apps, and much of it was money transferred between customers of the same bank. In part, that’s a statement about who uses different systems, and what they are used for. Venmo and other non-bank systems are accessed about twice as often as bank systems, but for much smaller transactions, according to Aite Group. The average money transfer on a non-bank system is $135; the average for bank systems is $1,359, according to the report. That might suggest that parents sending money to a student for college tuition, for instance, might be more likely to transfer money through a bank, while students are much more likely to split a restaurant bill or bar tab using Venmo. The payment app is also a social network in its own right, with users sending messages to friends when they transfer money — a feature Venmo pioneered. Those messages shed light on what’s behind each transaction and indicate that Venmo is most often used among friends over food and drink, said Criscoe, the Venmo spokesman. “Pizza is the No. 1 emoji on Venmo; beer is a close follow,” he said, adding that other messages suggest users are splitting bigger-ticket items too, such as rent. Though Venmo and other non-bank payment systems are still a small part of the p2p market, banks want to make sure they keep their place in the financial order and keep their customers. This summer, Early Warning, a company owned by some of the nation’s largest banks, will release Zelle, a payment system built to compete with Venmo and others — and, banks hope, to make digital p2p payments more mainstream. Along with the release, Early Warning will kick off a marketing campaign showing not only how Zelle works but how it might be used. Lou Anne Alexander, president of Early Warning’s payments group, said the focus will be on appealing to older consumers who might not have tried p2p payments. “We’re trying to take (p2p) from millennials to the mainstream—customers might use a product like this,” Alexander said. “That might be managing contributions to the high school marching band or it might be renting a home on the beach with friends or family.” Zelle traces it roots back to 2011, when Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase set out to build a system — initially called ClearXchange — that would allow their customers to send money to each other using only phone numbers and email addresses. Before, customers could only transfer money to friends and family by entering account and routing numbers — information customers often didn’t know and might be concerned about sharing. Zelle is essentially a souped-up, rebranded version of ClearXchange. It will be available to anyone with a U.S. bank account, and it aims to overcome some of the limitations and confusion around the ClearXchange system. Sarah Grotta of research and consulting firm Mercator Advisory Group said banks didn’t do a great job of explaining that ClearXchange would allow customers to send money to customers of other banks. Part of the problem, she said, was that every bank has its own name for its ClearXchange-powered p2p system, including Chase QuickPay, Wells Fargo SurePay and Capital One P2P Payments. “It wasn’t well-marketed that someone at Chase could pay someone at Bank of America because they had different marketing and different branding,” Grotta said. “You could pay someone at any financial institution, but people never realized that.” To address that problem, banks over the next few months will begin rebranding their p2p transfer systems to include Zelle in the name. Chase, for instance, will start calling its system “QuickPay with Zelle.” Customers of more than a dozen big banks — representing most U.S. account holders — will be able to transfer money through the banks’ mobile apps. For other banks and credit unions, customers will be able to do so through the Zelle mobile app, set to be released this summer. Once the system is running and the marketing campaign kicks off, Grotta expects Zelle to be a hit. “This is going to be a much better user experience than the banks had before,” she said. “I think it will start to catch on once people see that they can in fact send money to another person at another financial institution.” For banks, the stakes are high. Though Venmo and other money transfer apps are tiny by comparison, Baker said banks are rightfully worried about what might happen if their customers interact more often with outside payment companies. If a customer opens an outside p2p payment app once a day and their mobile banking app just once a week, the payment company has more opportunities to sell that customer on products and services the bank would otherwise provide, she said. “Once Venmo builds up a strong enough customer base, then it can say, ‘Hey, come get a credit card from us,’ or ‘Come get a home loan from us,’” Baker said. “That’s the approach some providers are hoping to take.” Banks see other advantages too. Mary Harman, an executive in Bank of America’s consumer payments division, said it’s expensive for banks to process checks and move cash around, so an increase in digital p2p payments could cut costs. She said banks also want to give customers the services and options they want. Some customers, she said, might prefer using Venmo; others might prefer the implied security of managing financial transactions exclusively through their bank. “We serve 65-million households in the U.S., and not everyone will act the same way,” Harman said. We have to recognize that and have different products available in different places.” 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2pn2ARO

In some instances, tapping on an image result will now pull up a shoppable list of products featured inside the photo. So if, for example, you’re looking at a picture of a model wearing sunglasses and holding a handbag, Google may be able to display links to buy the bag and glasses, or at least a pair that’s similar to them. There are a bunch of constraints on how this works right now, but the implication is that this will eventually expand in a big way. At the moment, the shopping suggestions will appear in mobile searches and inside the Android search app. And they’re only supported for a few categories of products: handbags, sunglasses, and shoes. More categories and platforms will be added this year Other clothing will be added in “the next few months,” as will home and garden products. The shopping results are formally being called “similar Items.” Google says the feature relies on machine vision to analyze the products and pick out similar items. But it’s not clear how much that’s a factor, because the feature also depends in a big way on web developers, who need to specifically add metadata to a site before its images can offer up these suggestions. Search Engine Land points out that Google has actually been accepting this data since December. Either way, the addition makes plenty of sense. Google says “price and availability information” was a top request from image search users. And the addition starts to make image search seem a lot more like Pinterest — which itself is often an image search tool with attached shopping information. In much the same way, this opens the door for Google to bring in more revenue, as it’ll likely take a cut of sales its image search refers. Google plans to expand the feature to more platforms later this year.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha.

Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal.

Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Nvidia claims Pascal GPUs would challenge Google’s TensorFlow TPU in updated benchmarks Nvidia claims Pascal GPUs would challenge Google’s TensorFlow TPU in updated benchmarks By Joel Hruska on April 10, 2017 at 3:10 pm Comment Last week, we covered Google’s internal benchmarks of its own TPU, or tensor processing unit. Google’s results revealed that the TPU is much faster than a conventional GPU for processing inference workloads, at a fraction of the power consumption. While machine learning still takes place on GPUs, Google’s TPU results are a significant leap forward for inference processing — and Nvidia, as one might expect, has its own take on those numbers. According to a new blog post published by Nvidia, the comparison would’ve been quite different if Google had used its Pascal-class GPUs instead of relying on the older, Kepler-based, dual-GPU K80. Here’s Nvidia: Its team released technical information about the benefits of TPUs this past week. It asserts, among other things, that the TPU has 13x the inferencing performance of the K80. However, it doesn’t compare the TPU to the current generation Pascal-based P40. Nvidia’s claim that the TPU has 13x the performance of K80 is provisionally true, but there’s a snag. That 13x figure is the geometric mean of all the various workloads combined, as shown below: MLP0 – CNN1 refer to workloads. GM = geometric mean, WM = weighted mean. Since Google knows how much each individual workload contributes to the total workload suite, the weighted mean figures should be treated as more accurate. As Google notes, it’s a good analysis method when you don’t know how much each application contributes to the program mix. In this case, however, we do know that — and therefore, the more appropriate column to use is “WM,” which stands for “weighted mean.” Adjusted for application contributions, the gap between the TPU and the K80 increases to 15.3x. And, of course, that gap varies substantially from workload to workload, from no gap on LSTM1 to a 60x gap on MLP1. For reference, here’s the slideshow we used in last week’s story, with competitive performance figures for Haswell, K80, and Google’s TPU: Nvidia’s argument is that Pascal has vastly higher memory bandwidth and far more resources to throw at inference performance than K80. The net result of these improvements, according to Nvidia, is that the P40 offers 26x more inference performance than one die of a K80. It’s not clear which inference tests Nvidia is referring to with its claim of 26x improvement, and the varying results in the slideshow above demonstrate that the relative performance gap between Nvidia and Google is highly workload dependent. It’s also not clear if Nvidia’s claim takes Google’s tight latency caps into account. At the small batch sizes Google requires for its 8ms latency threshold, K80 utilization is just 37 percent of maximum theoretical performance. The vagueness of the claims make it difficult to evaluate them for accuracy. Google’s enormous lead in incremental performance per watt will be difficult to overcome. Click to enlarge. Google’s whitepaper (PDF) also anticipates this kind of claim. The researchers also disclosed that they’ve has modeled the expected performance improvement of a TPU with GDDR5 instead of DDR3, with substantially more memory bandwidth. Scaling memory bandwidth up by 4x would improve overall performance by 3x, at the cost of ~10% more die space. There are ways, in other words, to boost the TPU side of the equation as well. Click to enlarge There’s no arguing the P40 is much faster than K80; Nvidia’s documentation shows a 3-4x performance boost in inference workload between Pascal and Maxwell, to say nothing of Kepler. Even so, Google’s data shows a huge advantage for TPU performance-per-watt compared with GPUs, particularly once host server power is subtracted from the equation. This is the classic problem with trying to use a GPU against a custom-built ASIC — at the end of the day, a GPU contains a great deal of power-chewing hardware that a chip like Google’s TPU simply doesn’t need. A matter of resources It would have been interesting to see how Google’s TPU matched up against Nvidia’s newest and most powerful Pascal architecture, but I strongly suspect that it wouldn’t tell us much about which kind of solutions vendors are likely to use. For companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, custom-built ASICs offer the prospect of vastly improved efficiency. The cost of researching and building the ASIC can be tolerated because each company has the pockets to fund it and a guaranteed market for the final product. Google’s TPU is custom-designed for very specific workloads and excels at them. A GPU like Nvidia’s P40 is designed to perform well in a wider range of workloads with varying characteristics. Most companies, including plenty of Fortune 500 companies that might like to deploy deep learning or AI software, lack the expertise to handle in-house development. Companies that have this ability may well build custom circuits to handle future development, but the majority of firms will probably stick to using GPUs, at least for the foreseeable future.

Mars Aaron Vincent Elkaim,New York Times The MaRS Discovery District in Toronto is home to the new Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Steve Lohr     TORONTO — Long before Google started working on cars that drive themselves and Amazon was creating home appliances that talk, a handful of researchers in Canada — backed by the Canadian government and universities — were laying the groundwork for today's boom in artificial intelligence. But the centre of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada's young AI scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of AI startups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills and optimism are abundant. "Canada is not really reaping the benefits from this AI technical leadership and decades of investment by the Canadian government," said Tiff Macklem, former senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, who is dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. Now bringing AI home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country's expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country. And they want to build on the tenacity of veteran researchers like Geoffrey Hinton, Richard Sutton and Yoshua Bengio, who developed techniques that opened the door to remarkable improvements in an AI technology called machine learning, even as many computer scientists and the tech industry considered their work to be an unpromising backwater. There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture startups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and U.S. venture capitalists. In its recent budget, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged $125 million to support AI research centers in Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton, which will be public-private collaborations. The Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Toronto, announced two weeks ago, will be one of them. The institute begins with commitments of $130 million, about half the money coming from the national and provincial governments and the other half from corporate sponsors like Google, Accenture and Nvidia, as well as big Canadian companies like the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and Air Canada. Hinton, who was hired by Google in 2013 but remains a professor at the University of Toronto, will serve as its chief scientific adviser. The new institute will be in the MaRS Discovery District, a cluster of buildings in downtown Toronto, run by a public-private partnership, that is home to many tech startups including AI companies. Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are adding to their AI research teams in Canada.           The experience of two startups applying AI technology to drug discovery illustrate the challenges — and the opportunities — facing Canadian startups. Atomwise, a company that uses AI technology to predict what new molecules might combat specific diseases like multiple sclerosis, was founded in 2012. Its chief executive, Abraham Heifets, earned his PhD in computer science from the University of Toronto. When Heifets sought funding, he recalled, one potential Canadian investor said people had tried the same thing 20 years ago. "What could possibly be new?" Heifets said the investor had asked, and turned him down. Later, Heifets went to the Bay Area and met with Timothy Draper, founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Draper observed that he had invested in a couple of companies trying a similar approach 20 years ago. That didn't deter him from trying again. "That's a cultural issue, a different appetite for risk and willingness to accept failure," Heifets said. Atomwise moved to San Francisco to be close to its investors and the region's enormous talent pool. By contrast, Deep Genomics, founded in 2014, has stayed in Canada, and its U.S.-based venture backers encouraged it to remain in Toronto. CEO Brendan Frey studied under Hinton at the University of Toronto, and he has spent years on research that combines deep-learning AI and cell biology. When he hires software engineers, he asks them to make multiyear commitments. "There are a lot of distractions in the Bay Area," said Frey, who is also a professor at the university and a co-founder of the new Vector institute. "The hype is a little too hot down there. Besides, we have some of the best talent in the world here."   Both Atomwise and Deep Genomics were participants in different years in a program called the Creative Destruction Lab. Founded in 2012 by Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the Rotman School, the lab was set up to help technology-intensive startups. They are typically founded by a PhD scientist who has worked on an idea for five years, but has little or no business experience. In 2015, the program tilted toward AI startups, with 25 companies admitted. Last year, 50 AI startups were admitted, and this year will likely have 75, Agrawal said.         One of the X factors in Canada's drive to develop an AI industry is the Trump administration. Canadian AI scientists say they have received a stream of inquiries from U.S. researchers, concerned about the new administration's stance on immigration and other policies. Should there be a northward migration it wouldn't the first time. Hinton settled in Canada in 1987 in part because of the United States' clandestine support for the Contra guerrillas who sought to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.     New York Times | Most Read SEE MORE First of the Ion trains wows thousands News anchor learns of husband’s death on live TV Kitchener man missing since Sunday 11-year-old killed himself after girlfriend faked suicide online, mother says Grandfather of housing co-ops strived to help poor In Your Neighbourhood Today What to look for when choosing an RV unit Sauder’s Camping and Truck Accessories in St. Jacob’s, Ontario, is a family-owned business into its...

Yesterday also saw the search engine launch its Asia-Pacific (Apac) financial dashboard, sharing details on how consumers in 10 areas across the region — Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam — conducted searches for financial products over the last year. Some of the top financial Google searches in Singapore include: “How to make car insurance cheaper”, “Why life insurance is important for future success” as well as “How to avoid pitfalls in getting home equity loans”. The tool takes into account all the different languages. “The topic of insurance is very heavy in Singapore,” said Mr Michael Yue, industry head for banking and financial services, Google Singapore. “Financial literacy in Singapore is one of the highest in Asia and consumers like to be well-informed before making any decisions. Singaporeans care about financial planning and often turn to (Google) Search to help them understand financial products and investments.” With smartphone penetration rate at 91 per cent, Singaporeans have easy access to the Internet and have made it a one-stop platform to gather information and plan their finances, noted Google. Mobile search growth for financial products is increasing by 28 per cent year-on-year, it added. For example, using the mobile to send a search related to “investing” in Singapore drew an approximate query volume of 70 million for last year, compared to Hong Kong’s 40 million query volume, information from the APAC financial dashboard showed. Meanwhile a search related to “general banking” on Google doubled in mobile search volume for Singapore at 40 million, compared to Hong Kong’s 20 million. Mr Yue noted that many organisations have been making “incredible shifts” to digital services in recent years. “They understand that’s where the users are really spending their time. So when you look across all the major local banks, DBS, OCBC, UOB, they are investing quite heavily in digital channels,” he said. “I think it helps with their business (and) automisation as well because a digital channel can assist in either signing up new products or assisting (support) into the branches.” Among the other findings, Google also revealed that the search demand for financial products continues to climb up 11 per cent year-on-year, led by key market factors. Google noticed a peak in searches following topical issues in May to June last year, such as an interest in the Euro following the Brexit announcement, the launch of Digibank by DBS Bank, and the launch of new retail bonds by Oxley and Hyflux. The findings also showed that Singaporeans are savvy about their finances and keenly aware of movements in the financial sectors, Google noted. Two in three conduct their searches with a brand in mind when searching for financial products. “Seventy per cent of Singaporeans turn to their smartphones when they need information about a local business compared to 43 per cent in the United States,” noted Mr Yue. Using insights from Google’s Apac financial dashboard, financial brands can respond better to their consumers and engage them in more relevant ways, both online and offline, he said. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Business READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ’appy iPhone users as WhatsApp Web goes iOS ‘Your fried rice’s ready, Chef’ ‘Unicorns’ face up to reality of new dotcom bubble ‘Tweaks' to property cooling measures worth exploring, say industry players Wells Fargo's aggressive sales tactics hit small firms: WSJ Wells Fargo's 'Jump into January' was grim start to the year Wells Fargo report: no 'pattern of retaliation' against whistleblowers Weak crude oil stunts U.S. energy IPOs, boosts outlook for M&A Waymo targets second senior executive in Uber self-driving dispute Wall Street sees Fed balance sheet normalization plan by year end: Reuters poll Wall Street falls as Fed minutes reverse earlier rally Wall Street ends slightly higher; China meeting eyed Wall Street ends choppy session up slightly; energy helps Wall Street down on weak auto sales, doubts about Trump agenda Inside Today World U.N. chief calls for restart to Western Sahara talks: document United passenger dragged off overbooked flight Marvel will discipline Indonesian artist who sneaked political message into X-Men China draft cyber law mandates security assessment for outbound data Indonesia house speaker banned from travel, anti-graft officer attacked Business Australia says changes to BHP Billiton corporate structure must fit national interest Investors flee risk assets as geopolitical tensions heat up Exclusive - Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Diversify or die: China's independent oil refiners adapt to new challenges Toshiba aims to file results Tuesday without auditor endorsement: source Sports Same old Sergio writes a new script After injury woes, Marin, Ratchanok are ready for S’pore Open WTA Finals to move from Singapore to Manchester in 2019?

Today’s update to the Google Support page shows support for Boost Mobile in the US and new carriers in 6 other countries, too… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services As mentioned, the only new carrier for the US is Boost (via Android Police) — although that’s curious since Boost is a prepaid carrier and typically only postpaid carriers will support carrier billing like this. Also, Vodafone now supports carrier billing in Indonesia, Orange now supports it in Luxemborg, and Vietnam is adding two local carriers. Here’s the full list of new carriers (and their locales) with support for carrier billing: US: Boost Indonesia: Vodafone Kazakhstan: Beeline Luxembourg: Orange Pakistan: Telenor Pakistan Slovenia: Telekom Vietnam: Vietnamobile, Viettel With today’s addition of Boost, there are now six US carriers that support carrier billing through the Play Store: AT&T, Boost, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Verizon. You can set up direct carrier billing in the Play Store app. Stephen Hall @hallstephenj Stephen is Managing Editor at 9to5Google. Twitter DMs are open. Tips always welcome, never expected.

One of those areas is support for multiple users – Alexa allows users to change Amazon accounts once those users have been added to the same household, but thus far Google Home does not. That could all be changing shortly, as a new update to the Google Home apps adds a new card for multiple users. The kicker is that the card doesn’t have any function just yet, but the fact that it’s there is encouraging for folks who have been waiting for this feature. Hopefully its appearance means that the roll out of multiple users on Google Home is just around the corner. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard that support for multiple users might be coming to Google Home, but it probably serves as the best evidence we have to suggest it’s coming. Unfortunately, an image of the card – which was shared by Owen Williams on Twitter – doesn’t tell us how users will switch between accounts. Will it be done in app or can it be done through voice commands? Here’s hoping it’s the latter option. It’s been a big couple of weeks for Google Home. Not only is support for multiple users seemingly on the horizon, but Google recently sent its smart speaker across the Atlantic. On April 6, Google Home and Google WiFi launched in the UK after spending a few months exclusive to the US. We’ll keep an ear to the ground for more information on this highly anticipated Google Home feature. For now, Google is remaining tight-lipped, but with the Google Home app now referencing multiple users, it can’t be much longer until some official details surface. Stay tuned.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

XRTL: A Google Developer Working On New Real-Time Rendering Library Written by Michael Larabel in Google on 10 April 2017 at 03:55 PM EDT. 1 Comment A new, unofficial project at Google is XRTL, creating a cross-platform real-time rendering library, with support for Vulkan and other graphics APIs. XRTL is still in its very early stages and appears to be primarily the work of Google's Ben Vanik. From the project's GitHub repository, "A lightweight framework for writing efficient cross-platform rendering code in modern C++. It abstracts operating system and toolchain concepts to enable quick prototyping and interation of rich interactive applications that run beautifully everywhere. The library is engineered for small code sizes to enable fast loading and low resource usage even within web browsers." Vulkan and OpenGL are among the graphics targets and there are plans for Android and iOS support. EmScripten support also appears planned for web browser support. The work is still in its very early stages, so there isn't much documentation right now, but it should be an interesting project to watch in the future. Currently it can be built for macOS, Linux, and Windows. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 10,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics. Michael is also the lead developer of the Phoronix Test Suite, Phoromatic, and OpenBenchmarking.org automated benchmarking software.

By: Ankita Rai | Published: April 11, 2017 1:34 AM Marino Gualano, general manager & co-founder, MainAd Italy-headquartered display and retargeting expert MainAd aims to take an agency approach to become a full service provider for clients by incorporating services like TV, print and social in its portfolio. It is looking at both organic growth and inorganic growth to build expertise in areas such as second screen social networking. In an interview with BrandWagon’s Ankita Rai, MainAd’s Marino Gualano talks about the company’s association with India’s ProfiliAd, problems with the attribution model and minimising ad fraud. Excerpts: What is the reason behind MainAd’s association with ProfiliAd? What differentiation does it bring to the table in the affiliate marketing space? So far, India has been our technology hub, with an office in Kerala. We have been in India for 10 years now. ProfiliAd is our first venture in the affiliate marketing space and the focus here is to bring in new-age technological solutions along with strategic consultancy in the affiliate industry and empower marketers and agencies to track and optimise partnerships. ProfiliAd is also in the process of developing a bidding platform to facilitate advertiser and publisher collaborations. The focus will be on both web and mobile performance. A key focus of ProfiliAd in India is to curb fraudulent activities in the industry. For this, it is important to build the right tracking mechanism and better targeting capabilities. For example, getting genuine leads about customers is a problem in the BFSI sector; a common fraudulent activity is leads coming from the same IPs and a large percentage of non-contactable numbers. In case of the e-commerce industry, which mostly works on the CPA model, the problem is that some publishers are doing cookie stuffing. This is a major issue in the affiliate marketing space. Emailing is another major fraudulent activity. At ProfiliAd, we are building a platform to identify fraudulent activities and raise a flag. We are working with clients in the e-commerce, BFSI, entertainment, health and travel sectors. You may also like to watch: Advertisers are increasingly demanding more control over where their ads are placed. However, in the real-time bidding (RTB) model, transparency can be limited. Do you think so? Usually publishers rely on RTB. Those platforms deliver whatever traffic is coming. While they do have some antifraud mechanisms, RTB is just a marketplace; transparency can be limited in a marketplace as it allows placements to be purchased at a cheaper price. Advertisers are also becoming aware of the changing dynamics. As per their requirement, we train them, sometimes we give them access to buy traffic and we only provide categories and audience. Sometimes they only buy audience. It depends case to case. We know and understand the audience. In some countries we know 60% of the audience, making it easy to target. To give advertisers more transparency, we are working on our own bidding platform. ProfiliAd will benefit in India by integrating with our bidding platform. We have also built our own ad audience and there are many layers of filtration. Globally, attribution fraud is fast becoming the ad industry’s next big headache, especially in the retargeting space… In the advance programmatic markets like the US, it is difficult to identify who produces the traffic, who sells the traffic and who uses the traffic. It is more like retargeting companies are going directly to the source. In the attribution model, there is some misunderstanding in terms of how Google plays it role. In addition to advertisers’ internal KPIs, we also provide KPIs. But at the end of the day, they want to really compare how much to pay for sales and for leads. Google Analytics is taking out a lot of real sales coming from different players. For example, if you are a retargeter, you are proposing the same item to the same consumer who is about to buy. But when she finally decides to make a purchase, she searches the item on Google and buys it. That sale is Google’s. But 90% of the effort was done by different players. It is a big issue. We, as a member of IAB, have proposed putting forward a fair funnel for the attribution model, where everyone has their own piece of commission paid by the client. Google’s supremacy is such that it doesn’t allow transparency. How has the shift to mobile impacted the display and retargeting space? With consumers spending a majority of time on mobile, does it make sense to spend on programmatic display designed for the desktop world? That’s not true. Mobile is a natural evolution. Globally, for us, the share of mobile is 40% and desktop/laptop is 60%. In fact, for fast emerging countries such as in Africa, it is only mobile. In India, mobile is a majority. In the last 18 months, app has been the game changer. For us in-app advertising is much more effective. When doing display, one has to be consistent and cap the frequency. For example, you cannot deliver a car advertisement to a teenage-oriented gaming app and hope it works. Our data shows that most of the purchases for top clients are performed during work hours on laptop. It doesn’t matter anymore if a consumer is on mobile or desktop. Whether it is a shift from desktop to mobile or IOT, the focus is now on the audience. Retargeting strategies are becoming user centric and device agnostic. Retargeted ads could be annoying for audiences, if overdone. Is that a problem for retargeters? Ads are the soul of commerce. There is a shift towards non-intrusive ad formats. Also, in-app advertising is less intrusive. When done right, retargeting ads act as subtle reminders and help consumers make the right choice. If your frequency is right, it is a great marketing tactic. Being retargeters, we cannot choose any website. We really need to choose either a relevant website, or one where audiences will go. This mindset will also be transferred to ProfiliAd. We plan for the solution to be launched in India later this year. How important is native advertising as a part of the digital marketing mix? We have been using native in the US and European markets. It doesn’t work in all contexts. There is certain degree of context which needs to be built-in. You can never have a 100% native advertising strategy. [email protected] @rankita No Comments.

The process model, i.e. how Firefox is split into various processes and how these processes interact between each other is common to all platforms. For more information see the Electrolysis wiki page. The security aspects of a sandboxed child process are implemented on a per-platform basis.

File System Restrictions Sandboxing enforces file system write and read restrictions for XUL based add-on content (frame and process) scripts. To avoid issues as sandboxing features roll out add-on authors should update their legacy add-on code today such that content scripts no longer attempt to read or write from restricted locations. Note these restrictions do not affect WebExtension content script or XUL add-on script running in the browser process. File system access rules for content processes, reverse precedence: Location Access Type Restriction file system read/write deny by default install location write deny install location read allow system library locations write deny system library locations read allow profile/* read/write deny by default profile/extensions write deny profile/extensions read allow Debugging Features Activity Logging The following prefs control sandbox logging.

Windows Platform Specifics Windows Source Code Overview The core of the Windows sandbox is Google's chromium sandbox. Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library (bug 925471): For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Bug Lists Windows Content Process sbwc1 low integrity sandbox support Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

VAVAMk_2 We wouldn't be giving him the warm welcome to AP if we weren't hard on him ;) dcdttu "...couldn't care less" abc Any writer whose first post on this site is criticism of Google (especially the Pixel), gets my support! A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever. Christopher Bement You missed the part where it's near impossible to buy. None of the other shit really matters? Roy 1. New brand new tactic. 2. First generation made in 9 months.. 3. First generation made in 9 months. 4. Not really. 5. First generation made in 9 months. 6. First generation made in 9 months. 7. First generation made in 9 months. Still the best camera and the best software. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman 1. You mean comparable to all other flagships. 2. At worst it's an uninspired design, but not remotely terrible. 3. Meh. They're not great, but not actually *huge*. 4. Not remotely accurate. Fantastic screen. 5. Disappointing, but literally only one other flagship regularly has this and overall nobody but a few of us seem to really care. 6. Also disappointing, but somehow didn't hurt anybody else for years. 7. Nah. Not huge at all, and the ratio's merely not as great as we'd like. ike3232 LIST OF NUMBERS! Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

The company has reportedly offered to invest around $880 million in LG Display, in an effort to make sure the next Pixel has an adequate supply of displays. As noted by the Electronic Times (via Reuters), Google's original Pixel flagship is suffering from a lack of available OLED panels. Google has subsequently faced a lot of criticism over its insufficient supply of and inability to ship the original Pixel. Google’s investment wouldn't just be a purchase order for LG screens, but rather, a formation of a “strategic relationship” that would give LG Display the resources it needs to manufacturer enough flexible OLED panels in general, ET said. But it leads us to believe the investment is also a guarantee that Google will get all the supplies it needs for the next Pixel (dubbed Pixel 2), as part of the deal. Google Pixel 2 flagship and Pixel 2B budget phone details leak out Best smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy today Now, here's the thing: Google specifically wants “flexible” OLED displays for Pixel 2. Samsung uses flexible screens on the current Galaxy flagships, and Apple's iPhone 8 is rumoured to feature them as well. With a flexible screen, the Pixel 2 could have a display that bends around the body of the phone. So, does that mean the next Pixel will have an interactive edge display? Who knows.

Google now shows 'Similar Items' shopping links on select image searches Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 11:56am PDTApr 10, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 26 Share on Facebook 33 Share on Twitter Total Shares74 Google News If you need to find an image of something, you're probably going to use Google image search. This is simply the nature of the internet right now. You might start noticing a new block of images showing up in your results going forward, though. Google has rolled out a "Similar Items" feature. These images are essentially shopping links for items that are similar to the ones in the image result. This feature uses machine vision to identify products in images as you open them in search results. Similar Items then kicks in to display shopping results for, well... similar items. The images appear as a carousel with price tags and the site where they are items are available. You could probably consider these ads, but Google says finding price and availability information in image search was a requested feature by users. It works right now with items like handbags, sunglasses, and shoes. It will roll out in the coming months to home and garden items, too. Similar Items appear on the web and in the Google app search interface on Android. Retailers that want to make sure their content appears in Similar Items need to include the proper metadata like name, price, image, and currency.

Stuck Pixel: How Google is dropping the ball with its "consumer" phone strategy (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/10 12:08pm PDTApr 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 105 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Editorials News Pixel Pixel XL Videos I admit it. I am a Google fanboy. It’s not that I love Google at the exclusion of any other company.  I appreciate the merits of Apple’s business model as well as the thoughtful design of Microsoft's Surface devices. However, there’s something about that #4885ed Google Blue that spices up my life more so than #3b5998 Facebook Blue could ever do. Is it bias? Considering I am legally color blind, the answer is an affirmative yes. However, this bias has not blinded me to the fundamental difference between a company like Google and one like Apple. At Apple, the customer - the revenue generator - is you and me, the consumer. Though many of their decisions may be viewed as anti-consumer (e.g. the #donglelife), much can be said about their comparatively strong customer service as well as the fact that a part of the “Apple Tax” for their products goes toward the maintenance of brick and mortar facilities to which you can bring a broken device and receive a repair or replacement on the spot. On the other hand we have Google, and Google has customers, too. But those customers are neither you nor me. Google’s lifeblood is advertising, and the essential nutrient for ads is data - our data. We the consumers are not Google’s customers. Rather, we are batteries that power Google’s cash advertising engine. While this information is probably not new to most of you, nor is it to me, it helps to explain why Google can't successfully sell a product to save its life (which, at the moment, it has no need to do). Google’s inability to make a successful play in the consumer space is no more apparent than with the Pixel. Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success, but one with reservations. The Pixel is a solid phone. So is the OnePlus 3T. Sure the OP3T lacks the Pixel’s camera, but it is otherwise decent and happens to cost $400 less than a comparable Pixel XL - and is generally available for purchase, which the Pixel most certainly is not. Let’s also just pause for a minute to acknowledge the tone-deaf hubris of charging $30 for a poorly-made clear plastic case. Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. In my mind, the Nexus program was much truer to Google's “essence.” Nexus users, of which I was one, were willing batteries, providing our data, input, and patience to Google with the promise of reasonably priced hardware, decent specifications, a clean Android experience, and quick updates in return. Granted, despite the aforementioned caveats and the niche market, some of the shortfalls of the Nexus program were simply unacceptable by any standard for a product marketed and sold to consumers. Now we have the Pixel poseur masquerading as the poster child for a Google that cares about the consumer. While the software experience has been generally solid and bugs are being more regularly acknowledged and addressed, the high price, lack of new stock, and sorry replacement process show the pig under the lipstick. Google is still using us to acquire data on product demand and how much people value - in cash - a clean Android experience and quick updates. Once they have our data, we consumers are left holding the bag with a bitter taste in our mouths. Before I get too far down this rabbit hole I must remind myself that I am not the customer, and that I still admire Google for its pie in the sky curiosity and drive to experiment like the Bell Labs of old. So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less? Because I am a fanboy and because, I guess, being Google Blue is better than being some other kind of blue.

MrDrWho13 Is this the guy you hired after that ad? Was this the article which got him the place? I quite like this writing style. VAVAMk_2 We wouldn't be giving him the warm welcome to AP if we weren't hard on him ;) dcdttu "...couldn't care less" abc Any writer whose first post on this site is criticism of Google (especially the Pixel), gets my support! A brave man. Michael Oghia It was a great read, I enjoyed his writing style! chromaniac I have owned the Nexus One, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7. I am currently using the Nexus 6P. And I am now waiting for Nokia 9 to replace the Nexus. I never considered getting the Pixel and I am not looking forward to Pixel 2. Google can continue targeting the iPhone user base. I am out. 2×4 oneplus is the new nexus chromaniac Yup. Would have bought the 3T already if Nokia had not arrived on the scene. I recommend 3T to anyone looking for a great phone at reasonable price. Might end up getting the 3T or 4 (when it launches) if Nokia fails to impress. Suicide_Note http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/08/Funny-laugh-laughing-no-no-way-Not-ok-GIF.gif Corbin Davenport Except when it comes to updates. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/07/oneplus-silent-nougat-oneplus-2-oneplus-x-owners-pissed/ 2×4 OnePlus X can't get Nougat -- it runs a msm8974 OnePlus 2 could. still a better track record than most other OEMs Kevin Sauer Why though? Is it the price? FWIW I can't think of a phone I've loved more than the Pixel and I've tried more than a few, including the 6P. chromaniac Price is of course the biggest issue. Since the launch Google has a permanent 10-15% cashback offer through one route or the other. Even after that most variants are still pricier than S7 Edge. I cannot justify spending this much money on a phone. Devices like 3T are selling for half the price so it would make it even harder to sell it the next year at even 30% of the original cost. Not for me. I have no complaints though. I am no longer the target market for Google and it's perfectly OK. Competition is getting better and better. OnePlus has not sorted out software updates properly. Nokia just might fix that issue as well. Plus they have a history of coming out with phones with brilliant cameras so that part could also be solved with a high end Nokia device. Gotta love Android. Nexus was great. I do not really have to go for Pixel as excellent alternatives exist today. TheCarlosFontes Agreed. I still can't get over my Pixel XL experience. I bought the phone, didn't add insurance, and then found out I couldn't add insurance afterwards. I was never advised! I return my Pixel XL (Really Blue) to Google and when I go to order it again WITH insurance.. it's sold out. Now, who knows how long before it's back in stock. And what happens to the phone I bought? It was in perfect condition, in a case, for maybe 3 days. I can't imagine Google is just going to take that kind of loss on a phone. Are they selling refurbished devices as new? Jay Pixel sold out. Pixel XL 128GB sits in never-ending backorder land. It's been over 6 fucking months, Google. Get your and your partner's shit together​. K thanks.. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Have you seen all the comments (on this and other web sites) about people who are on their 3rd or 4th Pixel? Replacing bad phones takes priority over making new ones, I guess. So you'll just have to wait. Which makes me wonder about how many of those 2 million shipped since launch are just replacements... Jay I have just now, yes. I actually returned my Pixel XL due to constant bootlooping. 😕 I've wanted to go back to it but I'm sad to say that this wait to buy another has gotten tiring... and old. Very old. That, and the price staying the same after 6 months is now becoming a deterrent. TechGuy22 google never does anything right it's nothing new. Brad Well, they did Gmail right in my book. It's why I use it over all the other options out there. Jalal Welcome aboard, Trevor :) Aaqib Ismail It's almost like having to wait for an invite to buy the phone! That might be an exaggeration, but the fact of the matter is that Google is terrible at offering a phone which is not out of stock or back ordered for months. Have they learned nothing from the Nexus days? It's not even like they don't have the capital to produce enough phones to keep a constant supply JTio I don't get this article. I finished reading it and didn't really understand how Google is dropping the ball. Synacks Don't worry, I'll sum it up for everyone. 1. Massive price 2. Terrible design 3. Huge bezels (see #2) 4. Terrible screen 5. No wireless charging 6. No water resistance 7. Super effing huge phone with awful screen to body ratio (see #2 again) It's a fast phone, and it gets updates very quickly. But that's where it stops. ZettabyteGamer 1. Agreed 2. I think it's a beautiful phone, and so do many others 3. Agreed 4. How? It seems pretty great to me 5. Not that big of a deal, Apple doesn't either 6. Not a big issue either, the phone has been tested to function under water for over an hour Synacks 2. If they modified the bezels to fit better, then definitely yes. 4. Screen is just no bueno when compared to Samsung/Apple 5. Not a game changer, but a pretty common feature these days. 6. I'd prefer if it was listed as a spec so I don't get denied warranty. If I brought my S7E in for a warranty issue after water damage, they would replace it if the water strip wasn't pink. Not so sure Google would do the same. Jdban Isn't it a samsung screen though? JTio Yes Synacks A bit of Googling says that it's the same Samsung panel that HTC put in their A9 model which is basically the identically designed phone to the Pixel (but came out before the Pixel). JTio first of all huge difference of internals from the A9 to the Pixel. 2nd - are you even a pixel owner? And if you are, why haven't you sold yours yet and moved on? Synacks I have: 1. Personal S7 Edge & iPhone5S 2. Work Pixel & iPhone 6 S7E will be replaced with S8 in 11 days. 4Ui812 I'd wait for a price drop or the S9. Really no point in upgrading. The S7E is a solid phone. Synacks Unfortunately the S7's are plagued with bad silicon lottery. It's a known issue for them to end up slow and much less responsive after 6 months. Mine isn't as bad as some people have claimed but I do notice it. I could either pay $200 for a replacement unit or I can pay $60 (tax) to upgrade to the S8. I am just going to get the S8 and hope that they fixed that problem seen on the S7 line. I'd like my phone to be snappy for at least a year. 4Ui812 I've had mine since launch. The only issues I've had was a freeze up or 2. But that's it. Speeds been fine Daniel Orchard Except for the snap821 which is the reason it works pretty well... VAVAMk_2 It is a Samsung panel. HTC's role is purely as a manufacturer like FoxConn is for Apple iPhone. Synacks I'm not sure what HTC put in the first version of the Pixel. But looks like LG screen could be in the second. ZettabyteGamer I'm pretty positive the Pixel has a Samsung panel. madmax0609 It is a Samsung screen, but Samsung wouldn't be stupid enough to sell Google their best amoled screens... Those they keep for themselves. Joshua The Pixel has a top of the line Samsung display in it.. now you're just making shit up. Synacks Just because the display has a Samsung logo on it doesn't mean it's top of the line. The S7 screens are noticeably better. When you see a Chevy Cruze, do you automatically think that it has a top of the line Corvette motor in it? Samsung doesn't make just one display.... Joshua Google it. The model number of the pixel display was one of the top displays Samsung made during the time. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They're merely tuned differently. Did you even try switching it from CMYK to RGB? Some people prefer one over the other. Bryan Breguet And badly calibrated so it looks like shit. Unless you are blind. madmax0609 Google made that phone look like an iPhone on purpose. Humans are visual creatures... if a product looks like an iPhone, and has the price tag of an iPhone, then it must be as good or better than an iPhone. Therefore, people will buy. Very smart advertising on Google's part. J.J. Yes the things it lacks are not a big deal but when you can get a different phone for same or less price with said features it deminishes it's value. Synacks Right, if I bought a OnePlus phone at $300 I wouldn't ever complain if it didn't have wireless charging or water resistance. But in a $700 phone.... YES. JTio 1. Debatable 2-4. Disagree 5. Who cares 6. Would be nice but it's not Google dropping the ball Why did you put #7? Synacks See edited version. basically a placeholder JTio Got it. add 7 to 2-4 for me. I totally disagree with this. Plus it doesn't really relate to the article Christopher Bement #8. Unavailable for purchase destinyhud but this article dont even talk about any of it u posted. its about customer service Mix 8. Sell as lake front property! Drakenoid 9. Profit Matt Pretty sure 2-7 were not mentioned in the article. Max Terrible design and terrible screen? You need new glasses... All the others I can agree on different degrees... Synacks Sorry I was just comparing them to other phones in the same price range. All of them having better design and displays. If the Pixel was sitting in its technically suitable price rance where the Nexus's were ($350/450), both things would be acceptable. Max The only existing phone with undoubtedly "better design and display" would be the S7 edge, and now S8 (which tbf should be compared with Pixel 2 in 2017). All others are basically on similar level or below. But the S7e/S8 suffer from other disadvantages so they aren't perfect either. Synacks I really hope Pixel 2 will be the best phone ever.

Ryan Forgot the state of Google's Android, which is nowhere near reliable​ enough to be charging top dollar for AND selling your info. Daniël Franke If that's the truth, then neither is iOS, they both suck in different ways. I recently received an iPhone from work and I consider it quite unpleasant to work with compared to my OnePlus 3t. The notifications are horrible, the settings are difficult to reach. The keyboard is just annoying. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 solves most of those issues EcE I guess by this sentence: "I must remind myself that I am not the customer"? JTio Nailed it except if you buy this phone...then you are the customer EcE I 100% agree. I don't care if I am not their "main customer". If I'm paying you iPhone prices, I should at least receive decent customer care. FAR from the case. JTio Sorry you haven't received good support. I have had great support so far. Even had to replace my original. EcE Not just the customer support, the quality of the devices (everything, pixel, home, whatever the wifi is called), they are plagued with issues. These are not subsidized devices anymore. JTio I guess I have been lucky. I have two Onhubs. Have had no issues so far. Nope.jpeg It's raising the price, but not providing the quality that Apple does at the same. jonzey231 I was wondering who Trevor was...you basically speak for most of us. Haha. We hate Google but we just keep investing our time and resources in them...because Google lol. Welcome aboard! Suicide_Note I don't hate Google, and i use their products because i genuinely like them and the company. Of course, they're not perfect, but no company is, not to mention the majority of their products are FREE. Trevor Newman Thanks @jonzey231:disqus!. Been an avid follower of the site since '11 and happy to be contributing. turbooo Not really adding thing new to the conversation here... Jordan Palmer Welcome to fun, Trevor. HSidhu Hey explain us abt their messaging mess some day... Mr Google fan boy. Trevor Newman In process. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Google’s first attempt at a “true” Google Phone (R.I.P Nexus) has been a success" Not sure how you're measuring success. The Pixel has been plagued with problems, one of which cannot be fixed (halos in pictures). And 6 months after release, HTC has still only shipped about 2 million. That's pathetic compared to the competition. Trevor Newman "...but one with reservations." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Halos in pictures, crackling speakers, bluetooth turning off at random, microphones not working, random switching to speakerphone, shutting down at 30%-40% battery, boot loops, pathetic sales, all for the low low price of $869 for the Pixel Xl 128. And that's not to mention missing features like wireless charging, microSD... Those are a sheet load of reservations. skillfulshoe Well, I got mine for tree fiddy bringing it to t-mobile. So I'd say it wasn't a bad choice. Mix I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL. 'When' it works it is a great phone.... whispy_snippet You've collected a bunch of disparate, isolated complaints and then implied they affect every Pixel. They don't. whispy_snippet Halos in pictures. For goodness sake. I think I've seen this happen once, maybe twice, since buying it at launch. And I take a LOT of photos. If this is the biggest issue you can find in the Pixel it speaks volumes for the quality of the product. wicketr If Google wants to compete against other Android manufacturers, they've got to figure out their manufacturing problems. It's a disgrace it's taking them numerous years to figure this out. Secondly, if they want to ever compete with Apple, they're going to need to either match their retail stores so that a "genius bar" can fix problems/replace devices on the spot. That of course costs money, but Apple is doing, so should Google. Otherwise Google is just pocketing that money and calling us fools. They're already making a ton off the data they sell, so the devices should be subsidized. Why on Earth do they cost as much as an Apple and Samsung device when they're already selling our data and they have no retail space to help consumers out. They're completely mismanaged and meanwhile we're eating up the crap their giving us. Suicide_Note While i agree with much of what you said, there's no reason at all that Google's devices should be subsidized. That's insane. wicketr Ok, then they shouldn't be selling our data. That's insane. Apple is not selling user's data. Why should Google do it and why should we accept it if that's not being trickled down to the buyers of their devices? I'm not talking about fully subsidizing the device. I'm talking about $50-100 or something. Suicide_Note I think you're forgetting that Gmail, Inbox, Photos, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and on and on are all free to use. That's what you get in exchange for Google selling your data. Apple doesn't do it because they're a different company than Google. Apple has been about hardware since day one, whereas Google was about advertising, and only fairly recently got into the hardware game. AD1980 What? Paying Apple prices without the support and when they're also selling your data is what's insane. Jimk4003 Obviously, you're entitled to your opinion, but why not enjoy having an opinion based on facts, rather than misinformation? Google doesn't sell your data: https://privacy.google.com/intl/en-GB/how-ads-work.html Suicide_Note Right. So they should forever give away or charge cost for their phones? That's not a good long term business model. Adeel Ejaz I think this has been the case with pretty much everything​Google has done. They still work like a start-up and notorious for killing projects that don't stick. And I mean "stick" at Google's scale. Wave, Picasa, Voice, Talk, Reader, all these products were built as a start-up, and got killed like one. But like a fanboy, I do believe there will be brick about mortar stores, and eventually the pre-orders will disappear as well. But all this will take some time but Google will turn it's model much like as Apple's; there is no other option. Suicide_Note Voice is still around and isn't in danger of being killed any time soon. skillfulshoe Gmail was built as a start-up experiment. My point is, Google has a lot of projects that they do not kill and become something great. For example, the technology behind the camera in Google Glass ended up going into the phones as HDR+ and now is responsible for the Pixel's great camera. Suicide_Note Reports claim that the reason behind the lack of supply of Pixel phones is due to supply issues with the AMOLED screens they use. Apparently Google can't secure enough of them to fulfill what demand there is for the Pixel. It would seem Google woefully underestimated the demand for the Pixel, and didn't properly plan ahead to make sure there wouldn't be supply issues after the initial product run. skillfulshoe And that's why Google is investing almost $1billion in LG's display factories IIRC. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-lg-display-idUSKBN17C00M Andrew Gallagher Billion, not trillion skillfulshoe Oops, my mistake. Fixed. Suicide_Note https://media.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif MadMartigan Okay. So that explains the Pixel. Sadly, that's just the latest in a long list of woefully executed products. Nick V They only shipped 2.5 million phones. With all the advertising, you are saying they weren't expecting to ship that many? Most of the worst ship that in a year Sammy Phillips "Dead Pixel" is a headline just begging to be written. catalysto Or "Stuck Pixel". Sammy Phillips Given Google proclivity for killing products, "Dead Pixel" is latent gold. QuantumFoam Probably different country, but how do you not go with "Pixel Sticks"? Stefan van Manen Where Google messed up in my opinion is at the basics: price (too expensive for the non cutting-edge hardware) and availability (Im not even able to buy it on contract at the 4 big networks here in Holland). 2×4 he's newman give him a break! EcE Helloooooo Newwwman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2aefe2a4891db81811a1be9e7044f178d36f24a3fc310d6674ccf60af1a0cab6.gif MJ I am not sure it's fair to compare a company (Apple) that has been in hardware day one while Google is fairly new to the game. Google started as and is an Internet company at heart and I am not sure how else you make money except via ads. George Messaging apps... you make money with messaging apps... how else were they gonna sell those stickers? mattcoz And if one messaging app doesn't make enough money, just make another, and another, and... EcE and... MOAR STICKERS!! EcE It is fair when they are trying to compete with such company in every aspect, including prices. Google shouldn't get a pass, almost every single piece of hardware they have released (Nexus included) has been plagued with issues. They've been messing around with hardware since 2010 (unless there was something before the Nexus One). As far as I know the OP 3T has less issues than the Pixel at half the price. skillfulshoe Increase in cost gets you increase in criticism. The Pixels should have not had these problems, but stuff like this is not new to Google. The Nexus phones always had issues but was underplayed by, "But it is half the cost of flagship phones." Hopefully the Pixel 2 will be more thought out and have less issues. MJ Plagued with issues? I have owned three Nexus devices and now a Pixel XL with no major issues. Google hasn't designed a phone yet beyond "these are featured we like" to an OEM. The next Pixel will be totally designed by Google. That's why the OEM name has been on the Nexus phones and NOT Google's name. EcE Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc. The fact that you have not had any issues does not mean there aren't any. (half related) I had 3 LG G3s and 2 G4s (upgraded) before I got one I could sell "as is". There have been boot loop deniers all over the place and now there is a class action suit. Not because those people were lucky, the rest of us didn't have any issues. I had issues with a Nexus One a Nexus 4 and a Nexus 5. The first two were replaced a couple of times by my carrier. I don't own a Pixel but I've read about all the issues. Paul_Werner lol @ guaguei MJ "Nexus 5, no mention of LG, 6p no mention of guaguei, pixel, no mention of htc." What? The Nexus 5 had LG stamped on the back and the 6P had Huawei on it's back. LOL I owned both so please Google images of them. The Pixel XL does not say HTC but I did say the OEM name was on the Nexus phones. The fact is Google didn't do anymore more with the Pixel but take over the branding. Again, this will change with the next Pixel as Google will actually design the phone. I didn't say they have had no issues at all. EcE True, both were at the bottom, my bad. I completely forgot about the 5 (had a red one) and the first images that appear are of the black one. Still, why should they get a pass and not be compared to Apple when they are purposely placing the Pixels against the iPhone? MJ I didn't say they can't be compared but questioned if it was fair (at this point). EcE I still think it is fair. Otherwise, they should have released the Pixel as a Nexus and let the Pixel 2 be their true flagship. Will then be fair to compare them to Apple? Christopher Bement Battery life isn't an issue? I've owned 3 Nexus devices and now a Samsung S series, and each of the Nexuses would barely last a day, while my S7 Edge will last for two. Hell, aside from Doze, the Nexus 6 had built in CPU throttling at something like 50% battery which crippled the phone. And it still died before leaving work. I get that they like to push their charging technology, but you should be able to take the phone away from an outlet for a whole day, that's a safety issue. MJ I have always gotten a day most the time with my Nexus phones (did NOT has a N6) and now usually two days with my Pixel XL. Yes, I am on the lower end of usage which is by far the biggest factor on one's battery life. Your Edge S7 with a SD820 got better battery life? Shocker! That chipset rocks which is what my Pixel XL has... Safety issue? Christopher Bement Safety issue: Not being able to call for help because phone died. That's all really. T4rd I agree, which is why Google has no business charging the same premium Apple does for hardware they can't supply or support nearly as well as Apple. MJ That's a fair argument as I felt the Pixel were over priced myself but still bought the XL because prefer stock Android at the end of day. Still... I am not interested in Apple phones at all so would compare Google to other Android OEMs. ddevito I agree, but if that's true then you can't charge iPhone prices. Otherwise the market will respond. Every. Single. Time. Zsolt V Yes, they can. At some point the Galaxy S line actually overtook iPhone sales. I honestly feel that if it weren't for the Note 7 debacle, Apple would be in serious trouble this year, even with the mythical iPhone 8 savior. You can only ride the hype on name recognition for so long with an inferior product. ddevito Your Android fanboyism is showing. I'm not a big Cupertino fan but you can't honestly say the iPhone is in trouble. Zsolt V I didn't. Cecil Hardwood BS. Google has been around long enough and have worked with many hardware companies. This is not new to them. They are not stupid. Just incompetent. MJ Yes, working with hardware companies is the same as being a hardware company for over 30 years. #facepalm madcanada Well, no, Google didn't just start. Pixel is not made any differently than Nexus - it's still a 3rd party product in essence. Google took tighter control of design, sure, but considering that they didn't dramatically change the approach I think it's fair to say that Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now, and as far as cellphones go Apple only had a few years of a headstart. MJ Your comment made no sense to me... You started with Google didn't just start followed by the Nexus/Pixel phones are basically 3rd party devices (true) than said "Google was in their form of hardware game for some time now". no idea what that means... Apple has been designing and in control of their iPhone devices almost from the start. They have even designed their own SoC. Apple has been a true hardware company from day one and for over 30 years now. Google is mainly a software and Internet company. madcanada Well, I just mean we're either saying that Google didn't yet even start being in the hardware game, or that they were in their hardware game (whatever the form it took - 3rd party or other) since the fist Nexus. It's not like with Pixel they're doing anything dramatically different, so your comment about Google being fairly new isn't entirely correct. They either still aren't a hardware company, which strengthens the position of the article, or they are a hardware company (that outsources the hardware) which didn't get on top of their game in almost a decade. MJ What? My argument is it's not fair to compare them to Apple in hardware experience and I already laid that out in very clear terms. brgulker Sure Apple charges Pixel prices, but if my iPhone is defective I can go to an Apple Store, get a replacement on the spot, and have some peace of mind that the extra expense went to maintaining this store and the general customer service model. With Google, the extra cost goes to the bottom line and maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card. This is a really big part of why I decided to fully buy into the Apple ecosystem about a year and a half ago. I still own an Nvidia Shield for gaming, but that's it at the moment. That, and security updates, which at least some Google OEMs are taking more seriously now. madcanada my problem with pixel was the fact that compared to Nexus 6P they only gave an incremental update to processor and ram, everything else was literally the same. People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ. Download Camera NX for Nexus 6P and do a comparison with Pixel, you'll see what I mean. They didn't bring back waterproofing, didn't give us a bigger battery, didn't give us wireless charging, and didn't give us a dual camera set up. It felt as if they took Nexus 6P, added ram and changed the sot, and then locked a bunch of features behind the new product. Sure I can understand timed exclusive of Assistant, I can even swallow Pixel launcher being exclusive, but not giving zero-shutter lag to Nexus 6P users (which Nexus is perfectly capable of) was a dick move. So we essentially got a slightly faster Nexus 6P at double the price with exclusive software features, which pissed everyone off because we bought Nexus over Galaxy for the Google support and all them features! Getting an iPhone next, didn't use one since 3GS, gonna try it out. Sammy Phillips At least the Pixel can process more than 1 HDR+ shot at a time. The 6P took forever doing that. madcanada what do you mean? how Nexus compresses them one by one in the gallery afterwards and Pixel can do few at a time? Sammy Phillips Yeah when you take an HDR+ image on the 6P you have to wait for it to finish before you can take more. They fixed that on the Pixel, although I read someone else's comment here that mentioned they could have brought that feature to the 6P as well. madcanada there are two types of HDR+ modes on Pixel, HDR+ Auto and HDR+. Auto is the zero-lag one, Pixel consistently taking photos as soon as you open camera, when you press the button it simply starts to process the last couple of shots. HDR+ will take time to evaluate the picture and then take the shots it needs to take, which is why there is lag and which is why HDR+ pictures look a bit better quality wise. Nexus did not have zero lag HDR+ auto up until Camera NX brought it over, but now Nexus can do the same thing as Pixel - take shots all the time and then just mark those it needs in Auto mode. You can take many consecutive HDR shots on Nexus with Camera NX, I haven't tested the upper limit, but it works for up to 10 shots just tapping as fast as my finger can do it. My issue is that some third party developer had to do it, Google just fucked us over. Paul_Werner Yep, Camera NX stopped me from missing out on pretty much every feature of the Pixel Camera. Not that I'd spend that type of money on a minor update (Pixel from 6P) madcanada same thing, the update too minor. what pissed me off is that Google didn't release the camera app themselves. T4rd I have a 6P, but am not a big picture taker, so I haven't cared about camera performance much. But I'm rooted (on Pure Nexus ROM) and am wondering if no one at XDA or something has ported the Pixel's camera app over to the 6P or other phones..? Or did Google lock it down to only Pixel hardware somehow? madcanada they did, Camera NX is exactly that. It's a Google Camera app from Pixel, basically. FRKSUP While I agree, it was overpriced for what it is, they had to set a precedent. If they made it Nexus cheap, and then raise the price this year when they add waterproofing, feature Y, etc. consumers (non-tech savy people who know cost 2016 vs cost 2017 and not the specs driving the cost) would question the change in price. They're never going to be able to compete with Apple with less-than-Apple experience phones at high prices, nor with equal-to-Apple experience phones with lower prices. madcanada I think the article brings up the right point about why that is. Google isn't aiming for Apple experience, they want Apple dough. We're the stuff they're selling. FRKSUP I disagree. If we are the stuff they're selling, they should make the best experience for the least price to get more of us to give up our data as easy and cheap as possible. Nexus was closer to that model than Pixel. Pixel is more about the experience for the end customer (us) than the data we type into it for them to sell. I do not think the ads differentiate based on what phone or how expensive it is. madcanada Pixel is, yes, Google's business model is not though. The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. If Google can't sell Pixels - no one at Google would really even care that much - it's not their lifeline, even if you limit Google to Android in the scope of this conversation. Android would make money for Google regardless of how Google treats their customers. itguy08 "The difference is that if Apple can't sell any more iPhones - they go out of business. " Except Apple has the Mac business which they state is a Fortune 100 company by itself. Let that sink in just a little bit.... madcanada Okay there, Drax the Destroyer, we know nothing goes over your head. Suicide_Note I own both, and the Pixel camera far surpasses the 6P. madcanada are you using Camera NX instead of default Google Camera on Nexus? Alternatively are you using the HDR+ plus mode on both, because due the to the way zero-lag HDR works, Pixel uses higher ISO and the picture may look brighter. If you use Camera NX on Nexus you would get the same exact settings and same exact quality, not even close to "far surpassing". Feel free to verify yourself, compare pictures on the computer after, better yet post them here. Paul_Werner Yup or just watch Max Lee do it for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THwm57tjZQg madcanada that's a good video, but again it doesn't actually compare them the proper way. let me explain. Pixel is using a preset ISO for it's HDR+ auto mode, and that ISO is higher, so the shots could be taken quicker (mind you Pixel is doing it as soon as you open the camera app). That is why you see warmer tones and brighter pictures on the Pixel. Nexus (in the comparison video) is using the old HDR+ mode, the one where the phone evaluates the image and then takes a few shots with the ISO related to what the phone sees as opposed to what the preset for speed is. If the person in the video compared Pixel in HDR+ mode (the one with the lag), they would get identical to Nexus image - no warm tones, no overblown skies, and a bit darker overall. If Nexus was to use Camera NX in HDR+ auto mode - it would get identical images to Pixel in the comparison. Paul_Werner Oh I'm totally with you on that madcanada this guy did an updated video, with HDR+ on on both pixel and nexus, no auto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI81pqRLeEs this is what I was talking about ) Paul_Werner Yeah my Google-fu was a bit weak. I meant to find that video to share whispy_snippet Go and ask a regular consumer to do what you're asking. A camera is more than the hardware. madcanada what do you mean? whispy_snippet Most people, I think it's fair to say, stick with defaults. Default messaging app. Default web browser. Default mapping application. Just ask Apple! It's why they're so successful with lock-in. The point I'm making is that most people will stick to the default camera application when they purchase a phone. Out of the box, the Pixel's camera delivers much better images than the 6P. Sure, you could go trawling through the Google Play store to find a camera app for your 6P that gives you results closer to what you want. But most people will never even think to do this or even know it's possible. For this reason, Google took the time to develop a rock solid camera application with hugely impressive image processing. The resources and effort required to develop a kick ass camera experience out of the box is factored into the price. So when someone says "the camera is different" to the 6P, it is. The Pixel has a much better (arguably the best) camera out of the box and ultimately this is what matters to most people. madcanada I agree with your point, but it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion we're having. Nexus 6P and Pixel cameras are identical, save for 12.2 MP vs 13 MP respectively, the difference is only in software​. If Google cared about their customers they would've released the same camera app for Nexus themselves, instead some XDA dude did it. Without the artificial gap created by Google, Pixel is just a tat faster Nexus 6p, so charging twice the price and justifying it by simply fucking over the customer base is extremely annoying. whispy_snippet You said: 'People will say "camera was different", I would beg the differ.' I'm saying the camera on the Pixel IS different because of the software (the app and ISP). The software is everything and was the product of years of research and development work from Google. It's the reason why they were able to enter the market with their first, genuine mainstream flagship phone and trump Apple and Samsung's best cameras immediately. My point is entirely relevant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're pissed off that you're not getting the same experience with your 6P camera as Pixel customers are getting with their cameras - even though the hardware is fundamentally very similar. Am I right more or less? Look, I can sympathise to an extent. I was a Nexus user from way back. But ultimately, the Pixel was a more expensive device than the 6P. Pixel owners paid more and got a better camera. Why would Google try to bring a cheaper device's camera up to the same level? They want to sell more high end Pixels, not last gen's dead (RIP) Nexus 6P. When people try to argue "the Pixel is so expensive but the price isn't justified" this is one of the reasons why I say it actually is. T4rd Did you mean "Camera MX", not "NX"? I'm not seeing a "NX" in the Play Store, just "MX": https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magix.camera_mx. madcanada you have to google an apk. wait up. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/mod-camera-nx-v4-google-camera-zsl-hdr-t3494435 T4rd Ahh, nice. Thanks! madcanada you just need the one apk, don't worry about 60 fps mod, it's already there. Ocepi The biggest failure was the verizon "exclusivity". The Verizon edition has almost always been readily available since launch, but most consumers don't realize it is unlocked. William R. Washington I just had a friend walk into Best Buy, buy a Verizon model and pop his AT&T SIM, and he couldn't be happier. FRKSUP Most sheep don't know this though... Sir_Brizz And then when he has problems with it and Google won't help him nor Verizon or Best Buy? Steve McQueen Now that Huawei's new EMUI 5+ doesn't horribly suck, I'm liking them more and more. Can't see myself ever spending pixel money for a phone that doesn't get 7-9 hours of SOT on a single charge. skeeterfood Unless they finally start updating their phones to keep up with the Android security patches (My Honor 8 is still on the Dec 2016 security patch) and start releasing their kernel source in a timely matter, my Honor 8 will be the last Hauwei phone I ever touch... Mix I love stock Android and when the PIxel works it is an amazing phone; HOWEVER, I am on my 3rd 128GB Pixel XL and, so help me, if this ones dies I am fucking DONE with it. Google will be refunding that shit. Suicide_Note What happened with the other two? I'm genuinely curious because my 128 GB XL has been fantastic since day one. Mix 1st - Microphone died less than 3 weeks in. 2nd - Phone was at 95% charge, playing a game on my lunch and it bricked. 3rd one has been stellar (so far) but my 2nd one was great until a few weeks before it died. It starting rebooting itself and freezing. Warranty replacement's from Google have been good though it sucks not having a phone for 7 days. This is my 4th Android phone and hardware wise, my worst phone that I have ever owned. John Doe I am pretty sure Google sends you a replacement out first then you send back yours and they send it by next day shipping. T4rd Yeah, they cross-shipped my 6P when I RMA'd it so I wouldn't be without a phone until its replacement arrived. I didn't have to pay extra for it either. Mix Since I have done 2 RMA's with Google (Canada) I kind of know what they do. You can either have them place a hold for the phone ($1,400) on your creditcard and they ship you a phone, one you get it you put the label on the box and send it back and they release the hold once they get the phone, OR, you can do the no holds but you send them back your busted phone first and once they get it and look at it they send you your new device. Next day shipping it is not! 1st phone was 5 days to arrive from the day I called and my second phone was 7 days. 1st phone was easier to deal with as I could still use it for everything but calls, the second phone was bricked to no phone for a week kind of sucks. John Doe Ok so you chose the bad option that is your fault. Apple does the same exact thing. And it is next day here in the USA so maybe if you complained a bit they would have made it next day or 2 day shipping. Also wtf?...$1,400? Was that the cost of the phone? destinyhud google needs a sales center for all their hardware. heck even a google rep at bestbuy would do Juan Sutton The only way Google has dropped the ball is by not having enough stock to fill the demand, other wise the pixel is a great phone and it's been a joy to use since day one tim242 You are living in an alternate reality #alternativefacts Juan Sutton Naw bro, the vast majority of people that own the phone love the phone. The software experience (which in my opinion is the most important thing) is great. tim242 Software is nothing without reliable hardware Juan Sutton Ok, the pixel has that. But again the vast majority are not buying phones based on hardware, geeks obsess after that. they are buying the software on the phone and the eco system around it. When I take my phone out my pocket and begin to use it what does it do and how well it does it. tim242 The vast majority buy based on hardware, which is why Samsung sells so many phones. Juan Sutton The vast majority don't even know about hardware, just ask the average consumer. They couldnt tell what type of processor or pixels per square inch or any other hardware question. Samsung sells phones because then advertise like crazy, and most of the time when you go into a store the sales people push you to a iPhone or galaxy. Now I didn't say hardware isn't part of the equation. But not the most important. Now I do agree, most geeks buy based on hardware but not the average consumer. I'm out, have to go to work Lateef Alabi-Oki We are Google's customers. Let's see what happens to Google without us. Then the debate about whether or not we are customers is a non-starter. This idea that Google doesn't care about you because of advertising is a hopelessly flawed argument. Google just doesn't devote as many resources to being good a making, distributing, and MARKETING hardware as they do with their software services. If they devoted as much effort as Apple to the complete life cycle of making, selling and supporting their hardware, they'd be just as good as Apple, if not better. Investments in hardware cannot be short-term and half-assed. The currency for consumers buying and investing in hardware is trust. This is something Apple is keenly aware of, and Google is going to, unfortunately, have to figure out the hard way. You can't keep disowning and disavowing your products with reckless abandon and establish trust with users. You can't stop providing OS and security updates for perfectly functioning devices and earn users' loyalty. If Apple launched the iTurd, not only will it sell out in minutes, it will sell in millions of units. That's the power of an infinite brand cache. That's the power of trust. That's the power of loyalty. It happens when companies stand by their product no matter what. This is Google's fundamental crisis. Even their most ardent supporters are left anxious about how soon they'll abandon their products, much less how long they'll support it. Is it any wonder why they can't sell anything other than ads? opticalgenesis very confused when I read "#donglife" instead of "#donglelife" mjsalinger The idea that "we are not the customer" in ad-supported businesses is a fallacy created by Apple fan-boys to try to argue that Apple is inherently superior to Google. In ad-supported businesses, the user *is* the end-customer of the business' products, and the advertisers are the monetization source 'partners'. At the end of the day, the value of ads lessens greatly if the end customers aren't happy with the product produced. For a TV show, if the show is crap, then it will get lower ratings, and therefore fewer advertisers will want to purchase ads or they will only purchase ads at a lower price. Same with a newspaper. Although newspapers usually charge a small fee, most of the cost and profit is obtained via advertising. But if the product is crappy, it won't sell and ad $'s decline. In a case like Google, it's products and services are designed for users, to keep the user (who is the end "customer" of those products and services, not the advertiser, even if said products are free) happy. Happy users mean more users, and more users mean more advertisers wanting to reach those users for greater $ amounts, which means more profit for Google. The same is true for any ad-supported business. The customer relationship isn't necessarily related to who foots the bill (the monetization source), but who is the user. How it's monetized is a different question entirely. Even in most direct-to-consumer products, the customer doesn't directly buy the product from the producer of that product. If I buy an LG TV from Best Buy, for example, my transaction isn't with LG, but it's with Best Buy. Best Buy is LG's direct customer, and LG is dependent on Best Buy and other retailers purchasing enough stock to move it's product. While the line between monetization source and end-customer is closer in a direct-sale relationship than an ad-supported one, it's still not direct. An exception where there actually is a direct relationship between a consumer and a company is a case like buying an iPhone directly from the Apple Store; but the indirect nature still applies if you buy an iPhone at Verizon or at Best Buy... So can we please stop with the "we're not Google's customer" fallacy? We certainly are, because we use the products Google creates, and if we don't use them, then Google doesn't get $$. It's just slightly more indirect than with direct sale-to-consumer products... whispy_snippet 100% this. Cecil Hardwood I disagree. Google is selling data they gathered from you using their services. The people buying the data is the customer. The people using the services are users. mjsalinger You can disagree all you want, but from an economics point of view, you're wrong. 1) Google doesn't sell data. They sell ads that you can target to specific demographics. 2) The services are a product. If the product isn't good and doesn't keep a user base, then no ads. 3) 'Customer' doesn't always signify a monetary transaction. There are many examples in business where people are referred to as customers without a monetary transaction. In Google's case they have two customers. One, they sell adspace to a certain # of people in specific demographics for money. The second, they provide services for users in exchange for viewing ads. Both are customer relationships (providing a good or service in exchange for something of value). Nerds Logic Guess I should feel lucky. My wife and I both have pixel's and I have yet to have an issue with it. Not the ones mentioned in comments or any others. And I use the shit out of this phone. Also, this makes my 30th Android phone and only the 1st to not be rooted. tim242 "So why as a consumer do I continue to throw my money at a lover who could care less?" *couldn't care less Roger Siegenthaler Google most definitely does have to find a new way to make money except for ads and they know it. There's their investor notes that detail them knowing that adblockers and regulatory changes could prove very damaging to their ad revenue. And their intention to get <50% of their revenue from ads by 2020 all say truckloads about why they desperately want to get google home and pixels selling. sweenish I don't like the Apple store argument. I live in Wichita, the most populous city in Kansas. Everyone lives on the Missouri side of Kansas City. I have no Apple store. Plenty of other people don't have this recourse to fall back on. It's a bogus argument that holds no water outside of a 1 hour radius of Apple stores, and that's a massive chunk of the US. Sammy Phillips Well, it's not really a "bogus" argument as much as one that doesn't apply to a certain percentage of consumers. I think, though, that even if you don't live near an Apple store, you're likely to get a replacement from them faster and more reliably than Google. sweenish Based on what? Google has, by most accounts really stepped up their customer service for hardware issues, and that's been the case for a couple years now. And if an argument doesn't apply, it's bogus. And like I've said, it didn't apply to a lot of people. Sammy Phillips Ah, that's not what my understanding of it is. I've been under the impression that getting replacement Pixel is kind of a nightmare. I hear you though. My parents have iPhones and they live over an hour from an Apple store. Not exactly right around the corner. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou I strongly disagree. You can't judge a company's strategy on the first attempt. Wait for at least the 2nd generation to declare if Google is dropping the ball or not. Right now the Pixel has been hailed, with all its flaws and shortcomings, as the best Android phone of 2016. For a first shot, it's a hell of an achievement. Sure, it's not sexy. It's not water resistant. It doesn't have stereo speakers. But it still was enough of a success that Google didn't keep up with the demand. The question is "will they have learned for the 2nd generation?". If they did, then they have a recipe for success. Google Home, Google Wifi, Nest, these are indicators that Google is moving into the hardware space and that can't happen without a mobile phone lineup. Google isn't dropping the ball, they were testing the waters, and they were too shy about it. Let's wait and see about Pixel 2. pfmiller This wasn't their first attempt just because it's the first phone with a new name. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Same comment as I did for Bruce Wayne above. Google didn't even try for Nexus. It was more or less a developer's program that worked on the word-of-mouth. Nothing comparable to the amount of advertisement done for the Pixel, which was comparable to Apple's. pfmiller So they didn't do a good job before, that doesn't mean they didn't do it before. That only makes their mistakes less excusable. Next time will they have learned for the 9th generation? Doesn't sound so likely now, does it? Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou It's not that they didn't do a good job before. Before it simply wasn't a strategy to push the Nexus line. It was primarily intended as a developer-oriented, sort of geek-appealing program. Never pushed as a product for the masses like the Pixel was. Look, you can criticize as much as you want, there are many things Google could have done better. But wait for the second generation before you say "they dropped the ball". That will be a much better indicator than any pseudo-analysis made by people like us who only see a tiny window of the situation. Bruce Wayne They've been selling phones for years now. They're not new to the game. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou They never tried with the Nexus. Little to no advertising. Pixel was a whole different story. They did try and seemed to sell more than they anticipated. You have to compare oranges to oranges. Sir_Brizz This same argument was made when the Nexus 4 came out, because that also represented a shift in how the Nexus program was marketed and worked. TBF, the N5, N6, and 6P all got about the same amount of advertising as the Pixel has gotten. Ultimately, those programs could be considered a success because they sold those devices at a price point relative to their value proposition. I didn't mind having a hold on my account for my 6P, but that was also $300+ less than a comparable Pixel XL. I also knew I was buying a device with slower support and I was paying a good deal less for that. Pixel doesn't change much (it's just another Nexus with the same concessions and everything), but it does shift Google into a new game where they actually have to make a value proposition now, and they aren't in a good position to do that. The fact that they can't even keep stock of the Pixels is a pretty sad indicator of how ill prepared they are. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou Oh no. Not even close in terms of advertising. 6P got a little bit of it. But the amount of TV air time, of billboards and online ads? You can't be serious when you say the N5, 6 and 5x/6P got the same treatment. Maybe the closest was the 6 but is was mostly a carrier-level, b&m stores level one. Sir_Brizz I know it's hard to remember, but they did give lots of advertising. Even the N7 had a super bowl commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_12rHKqFD0 They have advertised these devices in the past. There is nothing that unique about the Pixel. Maybe it is slightly more, but I basically don't hear about it anymore. It had a decent initial push and now it's just like it was before. UniBroW This post summarizes why I have an iPhone 7 plus instead of a pixel in my pocket after years of dismissing Apple entirely sebastianer I can throw bullshit to the Nexus and Pixel line, while praising a lot the iPhones... But I can't still switch to an iPhone...even the latest iPhone 7 after 1-2 hours using it i want to kill myself (sarcastically). Also I've been using an iPhone for a week after my LG 5X died...but after a week ended up buying a 6P and can't be more happy (no matter the years I hated phablet...it's still so good to be using vanilla Android again). Most of the people can switch from iOS to Android or from Android to iOS...I'm part of the small group that can't switch to iOS, it's so different the way it works and so different to the way I use the phone. (As some people is part of the small group that can switch from iOS to Android, despite the hardware quality between Apple vs Nexus/Pixels). And when I say Android, I'm only referring to Nexus/Pixel/AndroidOne... Maybe Moto...but no. UniBroW I agree, mostly. There are so many things that make me want to throw the iPhone out the window so it's not all just peaches and cream but I went full on iOS. Sold my Pixel C for an iPad Pro and ordered a mini that I'm installing in my car dash as Android Auto and car play leave much to be desired. Overall though, I'm enjoying iOS more. I used to use iOS and think it was cumbersome but swiping back to go back in an app is way more intuitive then Androids broken back button that will either close an app or go back. Not to mention Google play music is much nicer from a ui standpoint on iOS then Android Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Exactly! This is precisely what led me to purchase an iPhone 7+ too. I have a Pixel XL also, but I ran into so many problems with it that I gave up and haven't used it in months. For Google to be charging iPhone prices for the Pixel, they definitely don't deliver on the iPhone experience. I bashed Apple for years based almost entirely on specs, pushing the narrative that their products are overpriced. But, now that Google is charging the same prices for products that are clearly inferior, what does that say about them? I was a die-hard Nexus user for years, buying nearly all of them since the Nexus 4 (with the exception of the 5X). And that's the biggest problem with the Pixel line as a whole. I had the Nexus 6P, and it beats out the Pixel XL in more than one area. I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel phones are essentially just a new Nexus devices, with a higher price tag and "made by Google" promotion. Sudarshan Krish It is absolutely not true that Google is not as good as Apple when it comes to replacements. Having bought my pixel off the Google store in the UK, replacement for me has been spontaneous, everytime I've had an issue with my phone.. It is almost as good as the next day delivery. Google has never let me down when it comes to covering me with replacement of my faulty devices, let alone pixel, even with my Nexusus (4, 6p) EcE Which store did you step into and talked to a person and get a replacement on the spot for your Nexus 4? destinyhud a call to customer care. not in stores Sudarshan Krish Sorry, I should have mentioned. I bought it online on Google play store here in the UK which is now the Google store.. Every time I've had an issue with my device they've RMAed it and sent a new device promptly! Hope that answers your question mate EcE That's cool. But it's not at the same level of customer care. They are charging a premium for all their products now and when there are issues, in some cases people are not as lucky as you have been. It's not difficult to find people complaining about waiting for weeks before getting a replacement. Something you can get done at an Apple store. I'm not a fan boy, I wish Google had their shit together but the fact is that they don't in most places in the world. UniBroW That's not as good, and when you had that you also had a hold for the full amount of the phone on your card. Also, good luck having them fix a screen on a broken Pixel C or Nexus 6p if you should be so unlucky to break one rmagruder My burning desire to get a Pixel went down the crapper the day I discovered Camera NX and zero-lag HDR+ auto on the 6P. I'll take my front firing stereo speakers, as well, thank you. Google really really overpriced the Pixel. They almost got away with the camera sleight of hand, but Camera NX fixes that. I'll wait and see what happens with the Pixel 2. And on another note, anyone note that the android audio latency is still not great on a Pixel, and it doesn't sound like other OEM's are stepping up either. Until Google a) delivers its own phone with sub 10ms audio loopback latency through the headphone jack and b) uses its Google Play licensing to make sure every OEM does as well, Android will continue to be a joke in the music-creation/DAW/Smule business. 4Ui812 Hey Trevor , your boss told me to tell you to refer to the Pixel phone as the Fixel from now. 😃 magnamentis no details, just generally think into the same direction but want to add that without that "bias" which you mentioned, one with a clear analytic approach could start to see it coming with the nexus 6 ( i own it ) and the 6p/5x line were in parts confirming my reservations and the pixel has not even been on my list to consider anymore. the last great "nexus" was the N5 which of course i own as well and the nexus 4 at it's time was a very nice phone as well. all the rest like pricing an the likes you mentioned, not talking even about huge bezels and too many flaws (defective devices etc) i'm just wondering how long ti will take (hopefully never) until you will have to divert from your straight line of thinking (and writing) and moderate the little bit that counts to survive (the web is cruel as we know and many don't want to hear the truth but only confirmation that their decisions were smart and right ) kudos and good luck iernie *couldn't care less Sorry, I just had to. You're saying Google could actually care less about you when I think you tried to convey the opposite. ipsofact Well written article. Bienvenido :) ! sebastianer 750€ for a Pixel that still has terrible compass accuracy, also can't retain accuracy, compared to old Phones like the iPhone 5S...using-the-same-google-Maps-application. 24 months of updates... And who knows if it's gonna boot loop or kill the battery in the next 8-12 months like the 5X and the 6P did. I'm gonna wait for the Next pixel line... YouNex Wtf is this article ? No matter which camp you belong to, this will still trigger you ! Calm down AP, sometimes you need to think twice before taking a dump like this.. Mark McCoskey I guess I'm a bit of a fanboy myself. I'm using a 2+ year old Moto Nexus 6 on Project Fi. I prefer the pure Android experience, with it's frequent updates (like Apple iOS). I am not a fan of the Pixel's "Premium" price, though. I'm a cheap bastard. I'm holding out for the release of US Android One's. I even periodically Tweet Sundar about Google's need to open up Fi to all manufactures, making all phones Fi ready, and the NEED for budget, sub $300 pure Android phones and tablets. I like Project Fi's low cost, and want a pure Android phone, tablet to match. ddevito Can we just finally say the Pixel is an overall failure? Whether we're talking hardware, specs, pricing, customer service, etc...This thing so far has been a failure for Google. On this site you're either a Pixel lover or labeled a troll, yet now even the AP staff is writing posts about this. Averix I don't know if you can class it as a failure. They've sold a decent number of them from what we can infer. Even without the wireless charging, waterproofing, and having bezels the size of an iPhone, it seems to be selling ok. Personally, I hate it. It looks like a home button neutered iPhone. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a failure in the marketplace. ddevito It's been riddled with issues, they can't make enough or ship them, their customer service is atrocious. And it's extremely expensive. In any other industry that's considered a failure. Google gets a pass because the industry needs and wants a solid Apple competitor. Inexcusable mjsalinger Actually, that's *not* how they define success or failure in any industry. 1) "They can't make enough or ship them". That implies that their demand is far exceeding their planned supply. That's usually a sign of *success* in the marketplace, not failure. 2) Riddled with issues: So that's a hard one to say. Pretty much every consumer device has many issues, and they often get amplified on the Internet. I know several people with Pixels with zero issues, so I'm not sure how widespread the issues really are for most people. 3) "Their customer service is atrocious": What evidence do you have? Google's customer service has been top-notch in the past few years. Also, many product successes happen with poor customer service on the other end. Not the case here, but that doesn't come close to defining it as a "failure". 4) Expensive: That's your subjective opinion. It is on the higher end of phones, but if it's still selling at a high price, that's the very definition of success in an industry, not failure. tl; dr; None of the above points would indicate a failure in any industry - in fact, at least two of them would indicate *success*. Sir_Brizz 1) Or, they just can't produce even a small amount of them quickly. Which, given HTCs history, is not very unlikely here. 2) But it does have at least as many issues as any Nexus phone. 4) It's not subjective to say it's expensive. It's relative to previous Google phones. It's more expensive than the Nexus 6 and the Galaxy Nexus, both also partnered with carriers and relatively more expensive than other Nexus devices. Also, it is the same high price as the most expensive phones in the industry right now. mjsalinger 1) Maybe, that's possible. But the argument was made "they can't keep up with supply, therefore the Pixel is a failure." I'm not making an argument as to whether the Pixel is a failure or not, I'm saying that @ddevito didn't present any real evidence that the Pixel was a failure. I presented one reason why they can't keep up with demand. You presented another. Both are possible. But there's not enough evidence presented here to say which one is true, and neither prove that the Pixel is a failure as a product. 2) As does the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... Phones have issues. Maybe the Pixel has more, maybe not. But that doesn't define whether it's a failure as a product. 4) Sure, it's more expensive than the previous Google products and at the same high price as the most expensive phones. But the argument was that the product was a failure because it was expensive. My point was an economic one - if people are willing to pay for it at that price, then it's not "extremely expensive" for the market and it's not evidence that the product is a failure.. My whole point is that the Pixel can't be declared a failure by the arguments presented by @ddevito:disqus. They don't add up. Sir_Brizz 1) However, one of the scenarios is actually realistic and lines up with our history of both companies in manufacturing. The other is not. 2) I'm not arguing that the phone is the only one with problems, but I would say that it doesn't have less problems than a normal Nexus phone, which tended to have more problems generally speaking than a mainstream OEM phone would. Again, there is historical precedent on this one. 4) I would argue that it does make the phone less likely to succeed than otherwise, but I don't really know what his fail state was. The Pixel is definitely not a great successor to the Nexus line, definitely not a "new generation" of Google devices, etc. From those perspectives it IS a failure. It could still be a financial success (though, I personally doubt it's much more financially viable than any Nexus phone). ddevito Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Not even close, if you believe that you're a blind fanboy and not worthy of an adult conversation. The issues are documented and proven. Not widespread for many but there are definitely issues with a lot, indicating poor quality assurance. Yes their customer service sucks. Not just for Pixel. It takes DAYS for G Suite support to fix my issues at times, I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. Take your fanboy cap off once and a while. mjsalinger > Just because they can't ship them out fast enough does not automatically imply high demand. Of course it doesn't. But it also doesn't imply that it's a failure, as you indicated. So, this isn't evidence either way, and you didn't present any. On the issues with the phone, yes they are documented and proven. There are also plenty of documented and proven issues with the Galaxy S7, iPhone 7, etc... This is something that all smartphones have and go through. This is also Google's first phone, so this isn't alone enough to declare the Pixel a "failure", although it's probably your most credible point. > I RMA'd a couple devices in the past, absolutely horrendous. Agree with you there, used to be pretty bad. But their support lately has been outstanding in the device department. I had to RMA a Nexus device recently, went through a couple of diagnostic steps, and then got my replacement phone two days later with a shipping label to ship the old one back. NBD. > Expensive. Okay so by your definition a Ferrari isn't necessarily expensive. The Pixel is a high priced phone. When you sell at that price, expectations rise. Welcome to Capitalism. No, a Ferrari is expensive to me, but not necessarily to the type of person who would buy a Ferrari. Ferrari is targeting a higher price point than I can afford, but there are many who are willing. That's how capitalism works. And it being "expensive" or not doesn't determine that it is a failure. Otherwise, by your own definition, Ferrari's are failures because they are expensive. Last I checked, Ferrari's were selling quite well. This has nothing to do with my being a "Fanboy" or not. It has everything to do with you declaring the Pixel a failure and making arguments to support that fact that don't in any way indicate that the phone is a failure (except maybe the quality one, that's your only decent argument here...) whispy_snippet It has not been "riddled with issues". What nonsense. The odd software bug is something any device experiences whether it be from Google, Apple, Samsung or whoever. They haven't been able to make enough to ship them. That's correct. But that's not a failure of the Pixel but a failure of Google's relationships with suppliers. And finally, on the matter of price, it's not "extremely expensive" when compared to other high end flagship phones. ddevito Right. You just proved my point. When you put it all together you have a failure. Not every product sold is a success, sure they sold a few and sure they probably made money on it (but obviously without disclosing those numbers they're hiding something), but this isn't just any other OEM. It's the platform defacto owner. If Microsoft had a similar experience with the Surface it would have been DOA. Yet Google gets a pass because the media and the Android fanboys won't have it. You're not better than iSheep. whispy_snippet Put what all together? I deconstructed each of your points and the only issue still standing is a supply constraint - not a product problem. The first Surface, hell multiple iterations of the Surface, had its issues. That doesn't make it a failure. What it sounds like, to me, is wishful thinking. You seem to want the Pixel to be a failure so you've constructed some shonky narrative to fit your wish. The Pixel has a supply constraint issue. That's it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's impossible for any Google phone to be a failure because, well, because Google. Google could sell a picture of a phone scribbled in crayon as the Pixel 2, and Android web sites would say it's the Best Android Phone of 2017. Self-preservation. Sir_Brizz I just want to give you mad props that you didn't say "we are the product" or some version of that. It's a reciprocal relationship. Google provides us great services and we provide some aggregate data they can use to get more advertisers. The services they provide us are the products they create, not the other way around. I also have to agree that Pixel seems like a departure. I also don't think Google is in a position to compete in the handset market the way the Pixel implies they are. Their support capabilities and turnaround times, and the overall customer experience they can provide, are significantly inferior to even the worst OEM in their price bracket right now (probably HTC, which is saying something). I don't think that's a good thing. It really seems like this program needed some more time to bake, but really it should have been baking since the day they bought Motorola. Patrick Smithopolis The high price is a personal problem. I'm not sure what the lack of new stock has to do with you unless you're looking for a device. The replacement process is not ideal because they don't have brick and mortar stores. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman "...maybe a month-long replacement process of ‘ship and pray’ with buggy refurbished replacements and full-price holds on my credit card." I contacted Google by chat on Friday to describe my problem. My replacement arrives tomorrow. Outside of being able to walk into an Apple store and walk out with the replacement, nobody's warranty support is as good as Google's when purchased from their store. Sir_Brizz You do still have a full price hold on your credit card, though. I generally agree that Google has as good support as you can get with the methods they have available. However, the fact that it is not comparable to their competitors by default means that the phone has a lower value proposition. That's not as much a complaint about their support as it is about their pricing. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I can't think of a single company that's ever done an advance exchange for me that didn't put a full-price hold on my credit card. It's standard. If you're willing to send it to them first, they won't. But if you want one sent to you first, they have to secure the value. I don't fault this. I don't find the phone incomparable to its competitors at all. But that's a non sequitur. Has nothing to do with the quote I was arguing against. Sir_Brizz I can't think of one, either. But that does make the fact they don't have any real in-store support (even at carrier stores, really) even harder to cope with. Even with Samsung, I can use my carrier store as a last resort if I am having problems. As far as the value proposition, I was pointing out that support plays into the value proposition of the device. From that perspective, it has everything to do with what you were arguing. Kevin Davis Verizon has done a no hold exchange for me, more than once. As a matter of fact, a couple of months ago, I had 2 "extra" iPhone 7 plus 128Gb models in my house that I had to send back to them. It's true, they do have my account info, but they have never placed an additional monetary hold on any card of mine that they have on record. Sir_Brizz Great, if you have Verizon. Oh, I see you were pointing out a company that didn't do a hold. Sorry. I guess there are a few. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman My experience with carriers is that they facilitate the process of the warranty exchange with the manufacturer, but you're still stuck with their terms. So when my daughter's phone's charging port broke, we took it into the carrier, and they charged me a $35 fee to handle the process for us, in which case a backordered replacement was shipped to the store later the next week, which we then came in to pick up. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. And we had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove the issue to them, which I didn't with Google. And yes, I actually purposefully pay more for my phones to get Google's support. I learned the hard way from earlier Nexus devices how despite sometimes getting a deal from third-party stores, it was worth it to buy from them to gain access to their amazing support. So yes, for me it is part of the value proposition, but in a positive way. Certainly of ALL Android options, since I have zero interest in Apple, they're unrivaled. Sir_Brizz That is completely true, however it's the in-store experience that makes a difference. Daniel Corbett I got one of the Google live cases and within 6 months it's useless. The live case software works only for days before it requires bring reset. After the charging port failed I went through the replace scenario. So far the refurbished replacement is adequate. Hopefully that continues. Kevin Davis I admire you for being able to use one of their"live" cases for 6 months. I purchased one for my Pixel XL and it was the slickest phone case I've ever owned, by far. I could have sprayed my naked phone down with WD40 and had a better grip. VAVAMk_2 One carrier in US and not enough inventory sucks Vega007 Works great on T-Mobile. VAVAMk_2 But for those who buy from carriers only 1 option. I buy from Google, but I know most people in US buy directly from their carrier. Eric Brown I feel like the article over-simplifies the in store experience at the Apple store when dealing with iPhones. It's extremely frustrating in reality. You have to schedule an appointment which is usually days out (same amount of time it would take to ship a Pixel). After scheduling the appointment, and you show up days later at the specified time, you generally have to wait around in the store for the service. Any customer in there trying to buy a new phone is supported immediately, but the existing customer with an appointment is forced to wait around. It's a terrible model and I don't give Apple any points for it. Sir_Brizz This isn't always the case. Especially when I've had a broken device, I can usually get an appointment within a couple hours and they will give me a refurbished device the same day. I have many complaints about Apple support for sure, but they really can't be beat on having a store you can actually go to. ck125 It's ok they will get it next time around (Every time Google does something with a phone). Face it, Google is horrible at product launches/stock with phones. Come on Google. Vega007 Screen, software and camera have to be the three most important things a phone needs to get right, everything else after that is just water under the bridge. And this is why I love my Pixel. Jens Knutson "you're not the customer, you're the product" UGH. Can we *please* retire this lame old chestnut? https://goo.gl/MQ7j26 Very disappointed to see an AP writer using this flawed, populist opinion. The only real problem with the Pixel is that they don't make *nearly* enough of them. That isn't to say it's perfect -- it isn't -- but availability is the only true deal breaker for the masses. (I realize that doesn't mean that people won't have their own individual deal-breakers, especially on a nerd-news site like AP, but don't make the mistake of projecting that onto the mass market. I'm sure the iPhone has some hardware deal-breakers for many AP readers, but that doesn't seem to have held it back either.) whispy_snippet "We the consumers are not Google’s customers." I fundamentally disagree with this. Just because advertisers are Google's customers doesn't mean the regular consumer can't be as well. Google sells a range of hardware products to consumers with varying levels of success. Yes, user data extracted from these devices is very important to Google. But these devices are still physical products being purchased with cash by consumers. This relationship is the same as that of an iPhone purchaser and Apple. The only difference is the product itself. Ryan And youre right. The Nexus was acceptable as a beta becuase it was half priced. At full-price im not buying into a beta. Im not buying a phone with a schizophrenic assistant​, broken bluetooth audio that hasnt been​ resolved in over a year and a garbage messaging platform. If the next Pixel is Nexus priced I'll consider it but goven the current state of the software if I'm paying a premium price im getting a premium phone, the iPhone. Ill start the process with an ipad. After 3 disappointing android tablets im done. So that will really soften the landing when i finally break my 9 year boycott of Apple products. Ian Mitchell Not to mention that you have to be a Verizon customer, which is dumb as hell, unless you buy one unlocked, which is outrageous. Zepid Nonsense. You can finance it just like you would through a carrier or subsidize it through Google's own service. Marcelove @Trevor Newman With Nexus the owners were beta testers of Google's products (me included). We didn't care much about that because the reasons you already wrote here... People now got upset because the experience with Dead Pixel was virtually the same as with Nexus devices, but Google charged a premium price. But at the end, you know who is the responsible? You and every single buyer of a Dead Pixel. So stop whining because you allowed this scenario when you didn't give a f**k when the Nexus program was chopped... You didn't care and happily send hundreds of dollars at Google's way... So man up, stop being a pu**y and accept the fact you are the only one to blame. JD Vote with your wallet, walk away from Google and block them from mining your data David MacKenzie I've had my Pixel since the day it came out in the US. It had been 3 years since I had given the Android world a try. I was overjoyed to finally cast my iPhone aside as the paperweight it was meant to be and get down to customizing my new..."Truely Pure" Google phone. ​Sadly, after 5-months in, I have officially declared the iPhone the more superior of the two. Google did not do a good enough job keeping the fanboys like me happy. The ongoing bugs, the spotty customer service when reaching out and the lack of apology for the bad user experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Where are the damn headphones by the way!? mrjayviper wholeheartedly agree with this article. If I'm paying Apple prices, I might as well get Apple since I know there customer service is topnotch and I can easily go to the hundreds of stores out there. Max Johnson Which is why I ended up getting an iPhone for the first time. JD Me too. donkeygoat Welcome Trevor! A good read! I like many, when hearing about the rumblings of the pixel was excited and then disappointed when it was released with the price. I am still kinda confused what the pixel is and where it wants to be. For example, my mate has been disappointed with the pixel's bluetooth. Connection is less reliable and the sound quality isn't as good as what you would expect a 'traditional flagship'. Then he finds out that the pixel doesn't support run of the mill codecs such as aptx. Now the nexus never had aptx and I thought the reasoning for that was because the nexus devices was more a cost effective option for developers. Why would Google waste money on spending licencing fees for aptx when the primary goal was to get the latest 'stock android' into developers hands? The pixel on the other hand is a premium priced phone for consumers - and sure, the there's plan for it in O, but I would argue that it should have been in place from the beginning if the phone was so consumer focused. bekifft Ideally these problems will all be solved when the phone is truly made by Google. It's painfully obvious that this first generation Pixel is just slapped together from the HTC spare parts bin. I look forward to their first REAL first party phone. jawsnnn I'm fine with the Pixel being what it is as phone "zero". But the next version better hit it out of the park in every single way or it is a dead fish to me. James Briano I'm gonna drive my 6P into the ground then check out iPhones. Google's been telling me "wait until next year" since the Galaxy Nexus. Cecil Hardwood You are 100% correct but it is ok. Google users are loyal to a fault and will continue giving the company a pass. Almost every product Google releases is a beta product so people are use to Google falling short. Just look at ChromeBooks. While not made by Google, Google fanboys use them and I have noticed that "Good Enough" is the new mantra because they are cheap (in price). Google has trained their followers to expect less while giving more. JD This post echoes all of my feelings. I want to love you Google and I'm willing to compromise. But not with what you want for the Pixel I'm not paying for that privilege to beta test for you and those recent shit decisions you've made Google. Adrian G I couldn't agree more. I've owned every Google phone other than the first. I reluctantly bought the Pixel XL at iPhone matching prices. Same price as the iPhone but no where near the service you get from Apple. To make matters worse, do you know how embarrassing it is when once every few times I try to connect to my chromecast to Netflix but it fails and then my wife's iPhone 6 connects no problem. Why does an iPhone work better with Chromecast than a Google Pixel!!! Michael2011 Google Pixel: Priced like an iPhone​ but without the iPhone support. Google's also continuing to data mine the heck out of the user. No thanks Google. Margaritas Ante Porcos Some of us are simply tired of this game of fighting Google just to be able to use a phone. It's 2017 now. We're supposed to be using normally working Android phones by now and yet Google is still experimenting and "labratting" us. And when it comes to any problem, Google never reacts, leaving us on our own with draining batteries or any other fckps. Maybe it's time for some of us to to go vocations for couple years to an Apple world. Where problems are rare and are fixed like it's Apple's business to take care of customers. I miss Apple. No company screws paying customers like Google does. It's not normal. Roy https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fef4fa148cb6b5c2f15fcd856ec70e90ed88abb6606e0f6554b4d09654040535.png Eric Marciniak Doesn't help that Best Buy has a giant iPhone 7 ad that literally blocks the pixel display from view right when you walk in haha. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8283702e9d03a34df4cfb2bd525ea593d0304d3937690392b7b3acc57eb7620e.jpg Jon E. Great article. Just fix the end with "couldn't care less" :) abc My favorite argument from Pixel fanboys is the imaginary tremendous sales that they keep claiming. Obviously, no official figures exist so one must speculate. But the facts are that the Pixel is only sold in 5 countries. That instantly makes it hard to have a phone with insane sales. Now if we presume that those countries are purchasing millions of Pixels, then we have to wonder why we don't see Pixels out in the wild nearly everyday in those countries. Obviously, if you sold millions of devices in a country, you expect to see a lot of those devices in people's hands. But we don't. john o’carroll I absolutely love your article! I have suffered the wrath of an extremely poor customer service on project fi and the flawed design of the Nexus 6P. RIP Nexus...Long story short, 5 phones later, all of which had the same problem with the frame and screen separation. Never allowed to return my phone for a refund and ended up leaving project fi and back to T-Mobile. Amazing what brick and mortar stores​ do for a company in keeping their customers happy. Keep up the good work Trevor! Gary The pixel is not a good phone. It has the worst reception of any cell phone that I've ever owned. It has a nice camera though. Insight Spinner I'm a Google fangirl. I admit it. I find this rant lackluster, but just like with Google I'll forgive you diluting the quality of your product in hopes the end result will be superior. I'll forgive you for not actually serving my needs, but rather, focusing on your own in the hours that eventually what you are saying will accidentally have greater benefit to me. Heeyyyy...Wait. Are YOU Google? Welcome! SimonPieman If you live in a big city, and an Apple store is a few blocks away, there might be some merit for this. For me, if I wanted to visit an Apple store, it's a 400 mile trip for a store replacement. Google on the other hand both times have had a posted replacement in my hands within 24 hours. I much prefer Google's model, it's universally suitable for everything, not just city dwellers.

So what started out as an app purely for making video calls now does voice calls too. Unfortunately, this just makes Google’s strategy with its many messaging/chat apps look more confusing than ever. At Google I/O 2016 The Best of Google I/O 2016, Nokia Makes a Comeback... [Tech News Digest] The Best of Google I/O 2016, Nokia Makes a Comeback...

Now, Duo also does voice calls, just like Hangouts, which Google recently split into Chat and Meet Google Splits Hangouts Into 'Chat' and 'Meet' Google Splits Hangouts Into 'Chat' and 'Meet' Google is splitting Hangouts into two separate apps, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet. No one seems to know why, but it's happening nonetheless. Read More . Confused? Then you’re not alone. Making Voice Calls Using Google Duo Almost a year after its debut, Google Duo has the ability to manage voice calls. Google tested voice calling inside Duo in Brazil last month, but it’s now available to users worldwide. We know because Duo’s technical lead, Justin Uberti, tweeted the following this past weekend. ?? Google Duo's new audio calling feature now available worldwide! pic.twitter.com/gFQxQTcu2S — Justin Uberti (@juberti) April 10, 2017 Duo was designed to keep things simple, and the integration of voice calling is no exception. Once you have updated the app, all you need to do is switch the toggle at the top of the app from Video to Audio. Et voila, you can now make an audio-only call without making sure your hair is on-point. Too Many Apps Which Do the Same Thing We can’t help thinking Google has one too many messaging/chat apps on its books at the moment. Most of which do the same, or very similar, things to each other.

No, really. Read More ? In a word, no. The big problem for Google is that none of these apps are gaining enough traction to justify their existence. Google would be doing us, and itself, a huge favor by rolling all of these various messaging/chat apps into just one master messaging/chat app which does everything. Right? Have you ever used Google Duo? If so, what do you think of it? Are you likely to use it for voice calls? If not, why not? What app do you use for video calls instead? Should Google fold all of its messaging/chat apps into one? Please let us know in the comments below!

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Google looks to LG for Pixel OLED screens after… Google looks to LG for Pixel OLED screens after Apple’s big order with Samsung By Bill Roberson — April 10, 2017 12:10 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Curves ahead A week after Apple placed a massive order for OLED iPhone screens with arch-rival Samsung, Google is apparently working on pretty much the same thing – except with Korean tech giant and arch rival LG. And guess what? Electronic Times is reporting that the order is for “curved screens,” just like Apple. And again, we are expecting the OLED screens, likely meant for a new Pixel phone, to wrap around the edges of the device. How many screens? While Apple’s order topped 90 million – and perhaps many more later on – no figures were released on the Google/LG order, but Google is reportedly paying nearly $900 million dollars for the order, so we’ll just guess and say “a whole lot of them.” When the original Pixel phones debuted, Google was often caught short on stock. Just like Apple, it looks like they’re hoping to have a lot of phones on hand when it debuts, perhaps later this year. The (nearly) silent service Ford is rolling out a new car for police departments, and not surprisingly, it’s a Ford Fusion hybrid. How will they ever catch any bad guys while driving a lethargic hybrid? Well, to borrow a few lines from a classic movie, this is no ordinary hybrid, this thing is pursuit rated. It’s got a cop motor, cop tires, cop shocks, skid plates for driving over curbs, and it’s made in 2017, so it’ll run good on regular gas – on electricity. Cop cars burn up to 60 percent of their gas at just sitting at idle, and since the engine in the Ford hybrid is off while it’s… idling, Ford says each car should save police departments nearly $4,000 in gas per car per year. Ford calls the Fusion Hybrid a “Police Responder,” and says it’s more for urban duties, despite its “pursuit” rating. Out on the open roads, big-bore all-gas cop cars, like the 150-mile an hour Dodge Charger, will still chase down the bad guys. Plenty fast, but…. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus is finally out, and since it’s packing as much cutting edge tech as Samsung could cram into the thing, it must be a real hot-rod when it comes to performance, right? Well, maybe. According to a side-by-side speed test posted by Everything Apple Pro on YouTube, the Galaxy S8 came in second on multiple speed tests against an iPhone 7 Plus, despite having more RAM and other more up-to-date features. The S8 runs the Snapdragon 835 quad-core processor at 2.35 gigahertz while the iPhone uses Apple proprietary in-house A10 chip, and only 3 gigs of RAM. So how is it winning? There are so many variables outside of pure processor speed: how the OS works, speed of RAM, graphics processing, and so on. Overall, the phones were pretty close in performance – the S8 is still a fast phone – we just felt it was interesting that an older competitor was still faster in almost every test they could come up with.

The company has reportedly offered to invest around $880 million in LG Display, in an effort to make sure the next Pixel has an adequate supply of displays. As noted by the Electronic Times (via Reuters), Google's original Pixel flagship is suffering from a lack of available OLED panels. Google has subsequently faced a lot of criticism over its insufficient supply of and inability to ship the original Pixel. Google’s investment wouldn't just be a purchase order for LG screens, but rather, a formation of a “strategic relationship” that would give LG Display the resources it needs to manufacturer enough flexible OLED panels in general, ET said. But it leads us to believe the investment is also a guarantee that Google will get all the supplies it needs for the next Pixel (dubbed Pixel 2), as part of the deal. Google Pixel 2 flagship and Pixel 2B budget phone details leak out Best smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy today Now, here's the thing: Google specifically wants “flexible” OLED displays for Pixel 2. Samsung uses flexible screens on the current Galaxy flagships, and Apple's iPhone 8 is rumoured to feature them as well. With a flexible screen, the Pixel 2 could have a display that bends around the body of the phone. So, does that mean the next Pixel will have an interactive edge display? Who knows.

Apple even took Samsung to court in an epic, multiyear legal battle over designs and alleged patent violations. But now something unusual is happening in the smartphone world: Apple and Google are copying Samsung. Back in 2015, Samsung brought out the Galaxy S6, a premium handset, and alongside it, the S6 Edge — a sister device that featured a curved screen along the edges. It followed it up with the S7 and the S7 Edge in 2016. Then last month it announced the Galaxy S8, which makes the curved screen standard and radically shrinks the bezels at the top and bottom of the device so the front is almost nothing but OLED screen. While the S8 hasn't officially been released to the public (that is set for later this month), initial hands-on reviews from journalists have been pretty positive, with the innovative design getting praise. And according to the latest rumours, it sounds as if both Apple and Google plan to copy that design in their coming flagship phones. First, Apple: The Cupertino, California-based technology company is expected to unveil a 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone this autumn. The "iPhone 8" is rumoured to be getting a major redesign — including a curved S8-style OLED screen. And Google also is due to bring out the second version of its high-end Pixel phone later this year. The latest reports suggest that it too will come with a flexible OLED screen that's curved. (In both cases, the usual caveats apply: These are rumours, not confirmed features, and the companies almost never discuss coming products before they are formally announced.) Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung This is a remarkable turn of events. Samsung's devices, while high-quality, typically hew closely to Apple's style. In a 132-page document from 2010, Samsung detailed how it could make its phones better — by making them resemble the iPhone much more closely. Apple has waged war on Samsung in the courts for years. But this time around, Samsung is leading the way — and Apple and Google are playing catch-up. This article was originally published on Business Insider. Copyright 2017.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News 4 Simple Ways To Engage Millennial Donors And Volunteers Online SOURCE: VolunteerMatch DESCRIPTION: Millennials are one of the most talked-about demographics in the marketing industry. With over $600 billion in annual spending power, they are a major force driving our economy. “How to market to millennials” is a catch-phrase Connect360 Multimedia hears many times over from nonprofits. But marketing to millennials doesn’t have to be hard, just focused. Start by taking the time to first understand and address the values that drive millennials — passion, diversity, and innovation. By ensuring your audience feels informed and involved, rather than sold to, your campaign message(s) and your mission will resonate. We know it’s easy to get overwhelmed when trying to build an online campaign, however. The technology itself can be confusing and the number of choices and platforms vast. In this post, we’re sharing four marketing strategies that nonprofits should keep in mind to get their cause in front of millennial donors and volunteers. We’ll share what they are, why they work, and how you can get started. Intent Marketing According to WordStream, intent marketing is any kind of marketing that aims to meet an end user or prospect’s intent (i.e. what they really want or need in that moment). What does that mean exactly? Let’s explain it this way: have you ever typed a question into a Google search, vertical search site, comparison shopping engine, product review site, blog, or other sites that have consumer data? You likely have, but if not, go ahead and try it now. We’ll even try one with you (warning: shameless plug). You see those websites listed closer to the top of the results page? They’ve got the concept of intent marketing down. The focus of intent marketing is to leverage your nonprofit’s work as the answer to people’s questions on Google. With free tools at your disposal, such as your nonprofit blog, website SEO, and/or Google AdWords grant, you can incorporate specific, relevant keywords and questions into your content that will increase website placement and searchability. Unsure about which keywords and questions your millennial visitors might be searching for? Check out WordStream or Google’s free keyword planner to help you formulate a few. Also, if you don’t have a blog for your nonprofit yet, check out this easy-to-follow guide that’ll help. Site Retargeting Site retargeting — or remarketing — is crucial for reaching millennials online and asking them to take action for a specific cause or event. The idea is simple: site retargeting is a form of online advertising that can help you keep your brand in front of bounced website traffic. (Bounced traffic are visitors who visit your website then leave, rather than continuing on to view other pages). Have you ever found yourself searching online for a new pair of shoes, then navigating away from the product’s page only to find an ad appear with the exact same pair you were just viewing? That’s site retargeting. Creepy? Borderline. Effective? Definitely! This ad spend focuses on attracting users who are already familiar with your brand by placing ads in front of visitors who are familiar with your site. Organizations like Connect360 work to make site retargeting a reality for nonprofits. They can help you ensure your brand remains top-of-mind long after your millennial website visitors are gone. Ad Placements Placing the right editorial content, video, and audio on popular channels such as Hulu, iHeart Radio, Pandora, Spotify, and Upworthy — places where millennials frequent on a regular basis — enable nonprofits to speak directly to millennial viewers as they are engaged online and in real-time. When Connect360 asked media experts about the latest trends in nonprofit storytelling, they agreed on the importance of sharing stories, making it relatable, and showcasing diversity on platforms such as these. Watch a recording of the event on Facebook, where you can learn more about trends and tips for placing content on these platforms. Content Publishers Popular social media channels — like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter — allow you to place ads in front of millennials on the networking platforms they engage with most. And while 41% of millennials use Facebook every day (higher than any platform), social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat are increasing in popularity. Often depicted as an industry-leading example, Charity: water’s Instagram ads remain relevant in a growing space. In this example, a short video spotlights the personality of those they help, connecting volunteers and donors directly with the people they impact (bravo, guys!). Let’s revisit about Facebook for a moment: you could try spreading your message organically, but with the platform’s constantly evolving algorithm, it’s becoming more and more difficult to get your content in front of the right audience. A simple ad on Facebook can target and engage the right millennial donors and volunteers where it matters, drive this core target audience to your website, and grow your social media following. Remember, millennials have never known the world without the Internet and social media. By developing a marketing plan using mobile strategies, targeting social groups, creating relevant and engaging content, and focusing on specific Internet platforms for message placement, your campaign will deliver the desired results.

By Fionna Agomuoh @FionnaatIBT On 04/10/17 AT 2:51 PM Close Future Google smartphones may look a lot like the Samsung Galaxy S8 if recent reports are to be believed. Google is looking into an $880 million investment deal with LG Display Co. to manufacture flexible OLED displays for future Google smartphones, according to ETNews. Since the deal is not yet finalized, it is likely the upcoming Google Pixel 2 may not feature a curved display. However, devices thereafter may be among the first Google smartphones to adopt the new design. Curved display smartphones are gearing up to be the new standard of design. Samsung pioneered the look on the Galaxy Note Edge in 2014. The device features a single curve on its right side, but Samsung quickly followed up with the first dual-edge curved display on the Galaxy S6 in 2015. Early in its inception, Samsung’s curved display was thought to have a functional purpose. However, over time the company resigned that dual-edges would primarily be a way to stand out in the market. Samsung began also licensing the design to other smartphone makers in 2016. Since then manufacturers such as Vivo and BlackBerry have also adopted a curved display design. In particular, Samsung uses the dual-edge so devices can maintain a larger display while being more compact. Following the Galaxy Note 7, all Samsung flagships are expected to feature a dual-edge design. Both the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus have curved edges. The upcoming Galaxy Note 8 is also expected to be a curved smartphone.   Rumors suggest the upcoming iPhone 8 may also feature a dual-edge display after reportedly partnering with Samsung to produce 160 million display panels. However, reports have not yet been confirmed.

It even outclasses the iPad Pro 9.7 in a few important areas, though there are some other aspects that aren't as good. We'll walk you through everything. It's similar to the iPad Pro 9.7... Devin Hance | CNBC First, the Galaxy Tab S3 has the same size 9.7-inch display as the smaller iPad Pro, and it's the same resolution, which means text and images are going to look just as sharp. It uses Samsung's high-end AMOLED panel, though, so you'll get much brighter colors. Your eyes sink right into the screen when viewing back really colorful images and movies. Like the iPad, the Galaxy Tab S3 is ideal not only for viewing content, but for creating it. Devin Hance | CNBC Samsung includes an S-Pen stylus that works really well and compares similarly to the Apple Pencil (which isn't included with the iPad Pro.) The S Pen can be used for drawing, painting and jotting down quick notes. There's even a feature that lets you jot down a quick note without having to unlock the tablet, which is super convenient. Devin Hance | CNBC The Tab S3 also supports a keyboard — a $129.99 accessory — and, like the iPad Pro, there's a smart connector on one side of the tablet that allows you to connect it without any sort of Bluetooth pairing. It just snaps right into place and starts working. Four stereo speakers sit on each corner of the device, as they also do on the iPad Pro. The Tab S3's speakers got nice and loud when I put the tablet on my coffee table and played a 60s playlist on Spotify while tidying up the living room one Saturday, and I really liked the clear audio while watching "Caddy Shack" from the couch. The similarities end there The Galaxy Tab S3 runs Android Nougat, the latest version of Google's software. It allows you to run apps side-by-side, similar to what Apple allows on its iPad Pro products, and even pop-out video for picture-in-picture viewing while performing other tasks. I'm worried about Android on tablets, though. Google frequently talks about Android for smartphones, but hasn't really discussed the OS for tablets recently. That makes me wonder how serious the future of Android tablets really is, and whether or not Google is putting its eggs into Chrome OS instead. Also, Samsung's updates are typically slow, so you might not get the latest version of Android for many months after it releases, if ever. Conversely, Apple updates its iPads frequently, and often supports individual models for many years. That's something to keep in mind. Devin Hance | CNBC Also, while developers have spent plenty of time optimizing applications for Apple's iPad — since they sell millions of units a quarter — developers aren't doing the same for Android tablets. Don't expect to find a ton of applications that support Android tablets or larger screens, for example. Instead, you'll mostly be using regular smartphone apps that are just blown up to take up the whole screen. That stinks. Those qualms about Android aside, the Tab S3 experience is really solid. Samsung includes one of Qualcomm's new processors under the hood, and it's nice and fast, allowing you to run multiple apps at once without running into hiccups. You can even upgrade the storage for more movies and apps, something Apple doesn't let you do with the iPad. Devin Hance | CNBC Speaking of movies, the Galaxy Tab S3's display supports full HDR viewing. HDR, if you're unfamiliar, is otherwise known as high dynamic range. The gist is that the image you're viewing is supposed to look more accurate, as Hollywood originally intended, thanks to a balance between the darkest colors on the screen and the brightest. There are a limited number of sources to actually view that content now – Amazon lets you stream HDR content for some of its shows - so that's not exactly a huge win over the iPad. You don't need to worry about movies hogging battery life, either. Devin Hance | CNBC Samsung promises up to 12 hours of video playback. That's enough for two cross-country flights. In my tests, I was easily able to make it through a weekend using the tablet for surfing the net, watching movies and playing some games. You'll want to keep the display brightness down, though, since it can really chug your battery's juice when it's up high. Worth considering Most people should just buy an iPad Pro 9.7. I understand iPads aren't for everyone, however, and that some consumers still really like Android on tablets. If you're in that group of consumers, the Galaxy Tab S3 is the best tablet you can buy.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News Wired: ‘Ever heard of the startup Deis? Well, Microsoft certainly did’ Getty Images Microsoft is acquiring Deis, an open-source software company that helps businesses build and operate massive online applications atop cloud services. In so doing, Microsoft is making a direct play to better compete with Google and Amazon. Though the startup is small and the purchase price is likely not that significant, the move underlines Microsoft’s commitment to the technologies that will define online infrastructure in the years to come—even though those technologies run counter to the business models that traditionally drove Microsoft. With its various open-source tools and help from cloud services like Microsoft’s Azure, Deis aims to significantly simplify the rather complex way that modern applications are both designed and operated. “They take what is really complicated, and they make it approachable—so that people can think about it at the concept level rather than a deep technical level,” says Brendan Burns, a notable figure inside Microsoft’s cloud division who helped drive the acquisition. This is hardly an unusual endeavor—it’s part of a much wider movement in the world of cloud computing—but it carries added significance because Microsoft is the one buying the startup. The deal is yet another sign that Microsoft is a very different company than it was just three years ago when Steve Ballmer still held the reins. At the tail end of Ballmer’s time as CEO, Microsoft was beginning to reimagine itself around those two very big ideas: open source software and cloud computing. But under new CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has wholeheartedly embraced them both, fully realizing how much they mean to the future of technology. “Satya is like the Pope Francis of software,” says Alex Polvi, founder and CEO of CoreOS, a company that plays in the same area as Deis. “He took this old institution and made it cool again.” From Google to Microsoft Burns and Gabe Monroy, the Deis chief technology officer, declined to discuss the terms of the deal. Deis operates offices in San Francisco and Boulder, Colorado, and it’s unclear whether the startup will physically relocate to Washington, given that the core of Microsoft’s cloud division operates from company headquarters near Seattle. In any event, Deis will continue to help coders and businesses erect online applications using Kubernetes, a sweeping open-source software tool originally developed at Google. Kubernetes is a way of carefully parcelling computing tasks across a vast array of machines. It was inspired by Borg, a system that served the same purpose inside Google, driving everything from Google Search to Gmail to Google Maps. In essence, Kubernetes provides a much more efficient way of running apps on a grand scale. It’s the kind of thing that can serve apps to million of customers, though it’s not something those consumers ever see. “What we were basically doing is offering up the secret sauce that runs Google as an open-source technology,” Google’s Craig McLuckie, one of the project’s creators, once told WIRED. This means that anyone else can use it, including Microsoft. Much like Google, Microsoft now offers a cloud computing service for coders and businesses to build and run applications atop Kubernetes without setting up their own hardware. Last year, the company even went so far as to hire one of the other engineers who originally built the tool inside Google: Brendan Burns. It was a hire that pointed to the very new and very real attitudes that now drive Microsoft. Just a few years ago, Microsoft wouldn’t have hired someone like Burns—and Burns wouldn’t have made the move. Microsoft Loves Linux For years, Microsoft not only steered clear of open-source software, but actively worked to suppress the movement, seeing it as a threat to its business, which was built on high-priced proprietary software like Windows and Office. But as Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and so many other markets embraced open source in the extreme, Microsoft was forced to rethink its stance. Kubernetes isn’t just open-source software. It isn’t just something Microsoft would have kept at arm’s length in the past. It’s a tool that hooks directly into Linux, the primary competitor to Microsoft’s Windows operating system. But this kind of thing is now essential to what Microsoft is building. According to Burns, about a third of the workloads running on its Azure cloud service are running atop Linux. In acquiring Deis, Microsoft is looking to better serve the enormous audience of coders and businesses building their operations in this way. And in the process, Satya Nadella and company are looking to better compete with Google—not to mention Amazon and other cloud players—in a market with enormous potential. Tech researcher Forrester predicts that the market for cloud services will grow to $191 billion by 2020, and both Amazon and Google believe this could be their biggest business—a bold statement when you consider that this is the world’s largest retailer and the world’s largest advertiser. Microsoft is now providing serious competition, in large part because it embraced tools like Kubernetes and Linux, people like Burns, and companies like Deis.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Uber Fires Back at Google Spinoff in Self-Driving Car Case By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: APRIL 10 2017 Uber is scoffing at claims that its expansion into self-driving cars hinges on trade secrets stolen from a Google spinoff, arguing that its ride-hailing service has been working on potentially superior technology. The legal defense, presented in documents filed Friday in San Francisco federal court, marks Uber's first detailed response to explosive allegations that its self-driving cars rely on crucial technology designed by Waymo. That company was created from an autonomous-vehicle project started at Google eight years ago. Once a Google ally, Uber emerged as a rival in the self-driving car market in early 2015 when it began developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles. Now, Waymo is trying to thwart that effort by persuading U.S. District Judge William Alsup to block Uber's self-car driving expansion on the grounds that it hinges on a high-tech heist. The case's outcome could alter the race to build self-driving cars that may transform transportation, reduce traffic deaths and launch a huge new industry. Laser Focus Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, claiming that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, stole its patented ideas. After the alleged theft, Levandowski left Google early last year to found a self-driving car startup called Otto that Uber bought for $680 million last August. But Uber is now presenting evidence that it began working on technology dramatically different from Waymo's more than a year before buying Otto. The dispute centers on a pivotal part of self-driving cars called LiDAR, an array of laser-based sensors that enable self-driving cars to see what's around them so they can safely navigate roads. In sworn declarations and diagrams, Uber argued that its engineers are working on a more sophisticated form of LiDAR than Waymo's. Among other things, Uber says its LiDAR uses four lenses for transmitting and receiving laser lights as opposed to the single lens in Waymo's version. "Waymo could not be more wrong, and Uber's design could not be more different," Uber's lawyers wrote in their rebuttal to the allegations. "And no wonder -- Uber's LiDAR was developed by a different team, using a different beam pattern, and leveraging different know-how." Weight of Evidence What's more, Uber says its custom-designed LiDAR system hasn't even been installed on the self-driving cars that it has been testing in Pittsburgh, Arizona and San Francisco. Instead, the company says it has been relying on LiDAR systems built by other vendors. Much of the information contained in Friday's filing was redacted to protect confidential business plans and secret technology. Uber may have its work cut out to sway Alsup, who has said in previous court hearings that Waymo has presented some of the strongest evidence he has seen in his judicial career. A hearing on Waymo's request for an injunction against Uber is scheduled for May 3. Although Waymo isn't suing him in this case, Levandowski will play a central role in how the lawsuit unfolds. Levandowski helped establish Google as an early leader in self-driving cars, earning him more than $120 million in incentive pay, according to information inadvertently revealed in court papers earlier this week. Before Levandowski defected from Google early last year start Otto, Waymo alleges he downloaded more than 14,000 documents containing trade secrets that is now helping Uber. After buying Otto, Uber put Levandowski in charge of Uber's self-driving project, a job that has been imperiled by this lawsuit. Alsup has warned that he may issue an order barring Levandowski from involvement in Uber's self-driving car division if he sides with Waymo. Uber says it hasn't found any evidence of ever possessing any of the files that Levandowski stands accused of stealing. Levandowski, meanwhile, has asserted his Fifth Amendment rights to protect himself if criminal charges are filed against him. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Samsung Trial Focus Is Succession Next Article > U.S. Regulators Accuse Google of Underpaying Female Workers PUBLISHED: APRIL 10 2017 Government investigators looking into how Google pays its employees have accused the tech giant of shortchanging women doing similar work to men. A U.S. Department of Labor official disclosed the agency's allegations during a Friday court hearing in San Francisco. "We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce," Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified, according to a report published by The Guardian. Google said it vehemently disagreed with the charges, which the Mountain View, California, company said it hadn't heard until Wipper's court appearance. "Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap," Google said in its statement. Google and other technology companies have been trying to improve hiring practices that have historically doled out most of their technical jobs to white and Asian men. Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. For instance, only 19 percent of Google's technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers are women. The Labor Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers' privacy. While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts. Earlier this year, the Labor Department also sued Oracle, alleging that the business software maker routinely pays white male workers more than their female and non-white counterparts for comparable jobs. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Google is set to address this issue with an upcoming update to its Home app. The feature has been rumored for a few weeks after the folks at Android Police spotted some code in the app hinting at multi-user support. Today, the Google Home app for Android and iOS actually announced multi-user support, although someone appears to have jumped the gun as the functionality isn't live. The message, which appears in the app’s “Discover” tab, reads: “Now, you and other in your home can get a personalized experience from your Assistant on Google Home. It’s unclear exactly how multi-user support will work, but the general expectation is that Home will be able to recognize different users’ voices and instantly leverage data from your calendar, emails, playlists and more without you having to open the Home app on a phone and manually switch. Home allows users to get real-time answers including the latest on weather, traffic, sports, finance, local businesses, and more. Although unlike its Amazon rival, Google hasn't yet allowed third-party developers to publish applications that work with the device, it does feature some integrations that allow it to control your smart home devices, entertainment equipment, and place online orders.

I'm switching to Windows By Trey Ratcliff on Apr 10, 2017, 7:00 AM 44 comments TechSpot A word about the author: Trey Ratcliff is a world-famous photographer, artist, writer and adventurer. Trey's images and stories capture the beauty of exotic travel destinations and the humor of the bizarre situations he often finds himself in. There is always something new, unexpected and beautiful to see at StuckinCustoms.com. Switching from a Mac to Windows PC I converted to Apple over 5 years ago when it was clear to me Apple made the best products for creative professionals. I loved Apple and became a hardcore fanboy. I was all-in. Now, I’m switching back to PCs. The new line of MacBook Pros are not-that-awesome. Apple has always been a company that makes beautiful, well-designed products (and still does), but they’ve started to put an emphasis on sleek design form over professional function. Why am I switching from a Mac to PC? I need a more powerful machine that can handle a LOT. I doubt I’m the only creative professional in this situation. Nowadays, my camera’s RAW files are bigger (I use a Hasselblad X1D, but my MacBook was still choking with my Sony A7Rii files), and I do a lot of video work as well. I simply need a workhorse. It’s too bad that Apple has chosen not to care so much about the creative professional; we were the ones that got them through the lean years. Oh well… Unboxing the beast Nothing better than unboxing a new toy! I also advise not using a corkscrew to unbox anything… even though I’ve probably done it over a dozen times, I haven’t improved. More reasons for the switch Windows 10 is getting really good, and Microsoft really seems to be innovating. I’m impressed and never thought I’d see the day… I thought they might just spiral down like IBM or WANG, but I’m happy they are making a come back. I’m also not an iPhone user, having switched to Android a long time ago. The new Google Pixel phone simply amazing! I’m pretty objective, and it is just a better phone all around, and it gets you out of that ridiculous closed Apple ecosystem. Even though I had a Macbook and an iPad, I always found the ecosystem to be quite confusing. iCloud will NOT stop demanding my family and I pay it more money. I never liked the Apple software apps like Mail (I use Google Inbox) or Apple Maps (I use Google Maps). While I was using Apple Photos to organize my final portfolio shots, I found it to be somewhat confusing and not as powerful as I needed it to be. Another reason is I really want to get into VR more and you need a powerful Windows machine for that. I want to do 360 art, play 360 games, and all that fun stuff. I’m a big gamer, and I like the idea of playing all those Steam games on my Windows laptop and even my tablet (I got the Surface Pro as well). How’s the switch going? Great! It hasn’t been as hard to switch to Windows 10 as I thought. Most of my woes have been around adjusting my photography workflow, but I needed to update that anyway. I was heavily reliant on a workflow where I had combined Adobe Lightroom and Apple Photos (formerly iPhoto), because I liked to keep my final portfolio in Photos. It synced nicely to my iPad and everything. Basically, I want to do everything on a big beefy laptop but also have a light tablet-like computer for more casual things. My shopping list – essentials I used to build my own PC gaming machines back in the day before I switched to Apple. I did a ton of of my own research this time around, and I remembered back in the day when I would build my own gaming PCs that I bought everything from Newegg! When I decided to switch, I called up my contacts over there to send over some of the goodies listed in this article and I’d link to them in this Switch Guide… so here we go! MSI WT72 (World’s first VR-ready mobile workstation) (I got the 17″ but maybe I should have gotten the 15″)  Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Samsung T3 Portable SSD (P.S. this thing is smaller than an iPhone!!) WD My Cloud PR2100 NAS WD My Book Pro WD My Passport Wireless Pro Bonus items Here are some other goodies I got for the Windows ecosystem: HTC Vive VR Kit Wacom Intuos Pro Pen Tablet Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum Mouse Samsung Gear 360 Camera Here’s a strange reason to switch I’ll give you a somewhat strange reason (but not my main reason). It gives you a chance to clean all your stuff up and re-organize. It’s literally like moving into a new house. It’s a pain, but it can also be kind of fun! Also, counter-intuitively it’s good for creatives to “mix things up” from time to time and be a bit uncomfortable. I’m not going to get all philosophical here, but maybe you know what I mean. You can read more about my new storage in Step 4 below. Switching while on the go The switch from Mac to Windows is challenging enough but I also did it while on a family vacation, moving from location to location. I was actually in the middle of a 60-day photo adventure around the world with my the wife and kids and everything. Balancing all that, the photography, AND a computer OS/hardware switch was quite the Olympian feat, I must say! Trey’s guide for creative professionals to switch from Mac to Windows This guide is a bit Trey-centric because, well, I am. Although from what I can tell, I have a fairly typical setup for a photography workflow. I mostly use Adobe products, which takes away 80% of the switching pain. I’d say the other 20% is a combination of finding those “little” apps you liked so much on the Mac and finding their counterparts on Windows. Well that, and getting used to the new UI! Step 1 – Get your essential programs up and running There’s an old joke about Internet Explorer – the first thing you do with it is download Google Chrome. That joke is so old now that Internet Explorer has been replaced by “Edge,” but you can still download Chrome. Actually, I used Edge a bit and it’s pretty good. They say that it’s more optimized for Windows 10, but I can’t tell any difference yet. Here’s a list of the most important things I installed first when setting up the new machine: Adobe Creative Cloud (I installed Lightroom, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro for video) Google Chrome Spotify Evernote Dropbox (or Google Drive if you use that) Photomatix CrashPlan Note: It is recommended that you try to get the apps from their websites rather than the Windows store, where sometimes the apps can be a bit outdated or imperfect. Additional Windows software that does various things: Gramblr PhraseExpress (a keyboard shortcut program) Step 2 – Begin the copy process I used my new sleek Samsung T3 Drive and began copying all my documents to it. I tended to drag whole folders, many of which were full of other folders. Even though I was dropbox-syncing, I also moved it over manually. It sped up the process quite a bit. If you’re not that familiar with the Mac folder system, be sure to look all through the Finder window at all the core directories on the left side. I had almost everything important under /TreyRatcliff — everything should copy over fine. Here’s some notes to think about: There’s no need to copy anything under “Applications” because those apps won’t work on Windows. If you’re planning to use this as an opportunity to “clean up” or “reorganize” your Dropbox, don’t do that until you have everything 100% copied over. If you make directory changes in the middle of a sync, it gets confusing. One thing at a time. If you have native app files, like Keynote files or Numbers files, be sure to convert them to Powerpoint or Google Docs first. I highly recommend Google Docs… just get them uploaded to your Google Drive and begin that conversion. If you have some “really fancy” Keynote docs, you may want to convert to Powerpoint, but understand that you’ll have to spend some time in Powerpoint to make those presentations as “smooth” as they were in Keynote. It’s possible… but it takes a while. If you can fit your whole Adobe Lightroom directory on a single drive, then do that. Mine is over 10 TB and is on a Pegasus Thunderbolt drive. So, in my case, I connected the old Pegasus Thunderbolt drive to my MacBook along with the new WD 16TB drive via USB and I made the copy that way. I’m not sure of an “easy” or automatic way to auto-sync my Lightroom Presets and Adobe Actions. I had to go find those directories and copy over directly. To find your Lightroom Presets, go into your Lightroom Preferences and look under Presets, there you’ll see a shortcut button. Step 3 – Get signed in everywhere and start syncing This is always a bit of a small logistical pain. Luckily if you’re a Google and Facebook user, then getting logged into those first helps with the other programs you may use like Spotify and Chrome. Adobe Creative Cloud is pretty straightforward. Remember you can only have 2 active logins with Creative Cloud, which I think is stupid. But that’s how they roll there at Adobe. Anyway, you can use your new computer to log out of all the others and create two new ones. It’s not too tough. If you’re a Spotify user and like local copies of all your music, you may need to log into their website and activate/deactivate different devices. You get three there. At this point, you should have all your programs signed in and the full syncing will begin. Everything from Evernote to Dropbox to Spotify to Chrome Favorites or whatever is in your app world will start to copy over. Step 4 – The great storage adventure Note this only applies if you are not dropbox/google syncing all your files. In my case, I have 12 TB of photos, and Dropbox would take at least another administration to sync. The first thing you need to know about sharing large capacity storage between Windows and MacOS is that how the external storage is formatted makes a HUGE difference. Since Windows and MacOS can both read and write to exFAT drives, it’s good to format the drive on the Mac using exFAT. I tried doing this on the PC and the Mac could not see it. When you go into Disk Utility on the Mac, just choose exFAT to format your new drive. Easy! So what storage did I go for? The Western Digital My Cloud Pro (PR2100) NAS. A Western Digital My Book Pro and the Western Digital My Passport Wireless Pro portable drive. Starting with the My Cloud Pro, first think about how you want your storage configured. My NAS is the 16TB model and it arrived set to 2x8TB mirrored (basically 8TB of storage with the 2nd drive used to keep a separate copy of every file an automated process). I used the web interface for the NAS to re-configure the drive to show as a single 16TB volume. (HOT TIP: When you first use the NAS, update the firmware then set the web interface timeout to be as long as possible. With the default settings the login times out before you complete the drive configuration and so it has to be done again.) Optional Step 4A – Keep the Aurora HDR party going I know many people reading this love Aurora HDR 2017 which is only for the Mac. By the way, for the record, I partnered with Macphun to make this app – it’s objectively incredible! We’re working on the Windows version now, but we don’t have it yet. So, I’m reluctantly keeping my Mac around ONLY for Aurora HDR. So this requires a temporary workflow change. Here’s what I did. I made a new folder on my Dropbox called “Aurora Me” I then made a new Lightroom Export called “Aurora Me” in which I export the brackets to that folder. It auto-syncs on my Mac. I open my Mac every few days and there is a pile of 10-100 photos in there for me to AuroraHDR-ize. Easy and fun. When I export it, I go to another Dropbox folder called “Completed” that ends up back on my PC. I simply import those final versions into Lightroom for final storage. At first, I thought this would be a big pain, but it really isn’t. It’s kind of nice using my MacBook Pro for just this one simple purpose. It takes up more desk space of course, but, well, it’s not the end of the world. Plus, it’s only temporary. Step 5 – Use the Windows machine exclusively for the first week I noticed when I switched from Nikon DSLRs to the Sony mirrorless systems that it was really a difficult switch when I had both available. I knew the Nikon system so well and I would have great photo ops. For example, I was offered a cool helicopter ride up to a glacier. I was staring at my two cameras on the table, and I would usually take the Nikon because I knew the system so well and I didn’t want to risk it with the Sony. Well then one day in Sydney my Nikon broke, so all I had was the Sony. I was forced to use it for a few weeks and I ended up loving it a lot more. I was able to see how much better it was and learned all of the advantages. I’m now seeing that with Windows. Yes, learning things in the new OS are a little painful. Windows is not quite as slick as iOS in a lot of ways. I found the trackpad not quite as nice for example, and I had to re-train my brain about a few different things. But that only took a week, and now I’m pretty smooth with it! Step 6 – Get your color right By default, your new PC will have a different color profile than your Mac. At the very least you’ll have to open your color preferences and adjust the saturation until it is the same as your Mac. I recommend you pull up your 10 favorite photos and put them side by side, adjusting the saturation and color on your new PC until they are the same. Even though this system is calibrated at the factory by MSI (and has built in color profiles) this is a mistake I made and for about a week, my photos were a bit off and more de-saturated than I like. I only noticed when I looked on my wife’s mac and my photos looked less colorful than I preferred. Bonus Step 7 – Surface Pro Party with the Microsoft Surface Pro! I didn’t think I’d like this machine, but I was wrong. I like it better than my iPad for sure. It’s a fully functional computer and not just a tablet. I’ve actually been altering my workflow quite a bit where I do many “daily” things on my Surface Pro – things like email, social media, Facebook stuff, etc etc. It’s a tiny little machine that I can set on my lap or anywhere. It’s also great because I can play Steam games on it, it travels well, I can do lightweight Lightroom stuff — I have some folders synced with my big computer, etc. Bonus Step 8 – Use your Nvidia graphics card with Adobe products This wasn’t obvious and was nowhere in the documentation. But the MSI computer has a “GFX” button under the power button to the left of the keyboard. When you click that, it asks you to reboot to use the fast Nvidia card at all times. This can have performance benefits in some applications such as Lightroom which by default use the less powerful Intel GPU rather than auto switch to the Nvidia which happens when gaming. Now I just keep that Nvidia GPU on all the time (no need to reboot). On the downside, it eats up more battery, but I am connected to power most of the time. Bonus Step 9 – Virtual reality I bought the funky HTC Vive VR Kit! This has been an unexpected joy to our family. We all LOVE playing VR. There are now so many fun games and apps – the kids and wife go crazy for it. I could stay in VR Google Earth forever. At some point, I’ll put together a list of all my favorite VR Apps and Games for you! Bonus Step X – Questions?? Okay, okay, this is a living document… what did I miss? What have you discovered? And thanks for reading this far – I hope you found it helpful!

Back in March, Google unveiled audio-calling in Duo but limited it to users in Brazil. At the time of the announcement it promised to bring the feature to the rest of the world “in the coming days,” but the global rollout took a little longer than expected. Nearly three weeks later, it’s finally arrived. To make an audio call, simply switch the toggle at the top of the screen from video to audio. Like video calling, audio calls works over cellular and Wi-Fi, and is meant to be used “in those moments when video calling isn't an option—like when you’re about to hop on a crowded bus or have a poor network connection.” As Google describes, “Duo audio calls work well on all connection speeds and won't eat up your data.” Google Duo hasn’t exactly been a runaway hit for Google, but it’s an important app in its arsenal. Essentially Android’s answer to Facetime on iOS, the app lets you easily set up a video call for anyone in your address book, provided they have the app installed first. And where Facetime is limited to Apple products, Duo is available across both platforms. The feature is available for users in the Play Store and iOS App Store. If you're not seeing it on your Android phone, you can download the Google-signed APK from APK Mirror. Calling for change: While the addition of audio calls in Duo is certainly useful, it doesn’t do much to help Google’s scattered messaging strategy. There are way too many apps and services to keep track of, with numerous overlapping features and functions. We’d love to see a unified system put in place that lets us chat and call from a single app, while keeping our conversations synced and accessible from any of our devices, but we're afraid that dream might be remain elusive for years to come.

Business & Tech This photo shows signage at the YouTube Space LA offices in Los Angeles | Image: Danny Moloshok / AP/Press Association Images 18:00 10 Apr 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 14 hours ago Core Media, the Irish ad giant that counts the likes of AIB, Aviva, Heineken, Musgrave and the National Lottery as clients, has provisionally called off its boycott of YouTube. The Irish Independent reports that country's largest media communications group has decided to "recommence some very controlled campaign activity" on the video service. It had suspended its campaigns on the Google-owned site following revelations that ads could appear alongside extremist content and even go towards funding its creators. Chief digital and data officer Justin Cullen said of the limited return: "This applies to all of our clients as opposed to individual brands. "We have had a number of campaigns activated over the last few days in these controlled areas of YouTube." Mr Cullen confirmed that the campaigns would be restricted to Vevo channels and homepage placements without re-targeting possibilities. Core Media revealed it has been seeking assurances from Google over "brand safety" and the possible risks of ads being placed alongside hate-speech or homophobic content: "We have seen a commitment from Google to deliver a better experience for advertisers that reduces potential compromise," Cullen added. Some 250 brands pulled their ads from the platform worldwide as a result of the controversy, with market analysts estimating that Google has lost as much as €750 million in revenue as a result. Google's damage limitation Last month, Google announced that it was introducing new tools to tackle extremist content and overhauling its policies in a move to end a mass boycott of advertisers. The tech giant had come under pressure to deal with a situation where videos from terrorist sympathisers were rubbing shoulders with – and being funding by – mainstream ads on its YouTube platform. Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler went as far as issuing a rare company apology. Writing in a blog post that also outlined a wide-ranging overhaul of how it is tackling extremist content, he said that Google was aware that companies and other organisations don't want their ads "next to content that doesn't align with their values". Schindler said: "We have strict policies that define where Google ads should appear, and in the vast majority of cases, our policies and tools work as intended. But at times we don’t get it right... "For this, we deeply apologise. We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us. "That’s why we've been conducting an extensive review of our advertising policies and tools, and why we made a public commitment last week to put in place changes that would give brands more control over where their ads appear." The solution His solution involves a three-tier revamp of policies across YouTube and its various other platforms. To begin with, a vast reduction in extremist content can be expected: "Starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content." Google is also moving to ensure that impersonators of other channels are unable to host advertising, while YouTube takes a "hard look" at its current community guidelines. Secondly, advertisers will have more control over where their money goes – thus preventing it from being spent on extremist content. Default options will be tightened to exclude "potentially objectionable" content right away. After than, companies will be able to exclude specific channels and sites from their campaigns and fine-tune where their ads appear. Finally, advertisers will be offered "more transparency and visibility on where their ads are running". This involves not only new AI tools, but the hiring of “significant numbers of people” to review content on an ongoing basis. 18:00 10 Apr 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 14 hours ago 4 Related articles Spotify, Tidal or Apple Music: Which streaming service is for you?

So far, the Trump administration is keeping them going. The cases have yet to be settled and the one against Google is now generating negative headlines in court. The development has surprised some people, considering the Trump administration's pro-business posture. Experts say it is largely the result of the vacancy at the top. "It's just the slowness of the appointment process," says David Fortney, former acting solicitor for the Department of Labor during the George H.W. Bush administration. Andrew Puzder, Trump's first pick for labor secretary, was forced to withdraw his nomination in February. He came under fire for employing an undocumented housekeeper and decades-old charges of domestic abuse. Alexander Acosta, Trump's next pick for the role, has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. After that it could still be months before a new head is appointed for the agency's Office of Federal Contact Compliance Programs (OFCCP), which is the group behind the tech lawsuits. "At this point, the decisions are being made largely by the senior career people, who are the ones who decided to file these lawsuits," says Fortney. "I don't think they have been reviewed closely by the new administration." The Labor Department accused Oracle of paying white men more than other employees and claimed Palantir discriminated against Asian job applicants. The government agency said Google had not turned over enough compensation data for its employees. On Friday, the department continued to press Google in court. Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified that the agency found a "systemic" problem of Google underpaying women, according to The Guardian. The Labor Department confirmed the comment to CNNTech. The allegations come at a sensitive time for tech companies like Google, which have publicly talked up the need to boost diversity internally. But recent diversity reports show Silicon Valley remains predominantly white and male. "We vehemently disagree with Ms. Wipper's claim," Google said in a statement provided to CNNTech. "Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn't provided any data, or shared its methodology." The ongoing lawsuits stem from the three companies providing cloud or data services to federal agencies. As federal contractors, the companies are obligated to show the government that their hiring practices do not discriminate based on gender, race, religion, sexual orientation and more. Reps for Palantir did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Oracle declined to comment on this story. In an earlier statement, Oracle described the complaint as "politically motivated." The two tech companies have close ties to the Trump administration. Peter Thiel, cofounder and chairman of Palantir, was an early Trump supporter and member of his transition team. Safra Catz, co-CEO of Oracle, was also on the transition team. Under Obama, the OFCCP was also "very aggressive" and "tried to push the envelope" on enforcement, according to one former Department of Labor employee who worked with the group and spoke on condition of anonymity. "We are not going to see that under Trump." "It certainly appears that some of the OFCCP actions were filed hoping to secure quick headlines," says Fortney. He expects the next agency head will reassess these suits to make sure the Labor Department's "limited resources are being effectively deployed." -- Sara O'Brien contributed to this story.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Uber Fires Back at Google Spinoff in Self-Driving Car Case By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: APRIL 10 2017 Uber is scoffing at claims that its expansion into self-driving cars hinges on trade secrets stolen from a Google spinoff, arguing that its ride-hailing service has been working on potentially superior technology. The legal defense, presented in documents filed Friday in San Francisco federal court, marks Uber's first detailed response to explosive allegations that its self-driving cars rely on crucial technology designed by Waymo. That company was created from an autonomous-vehicle project started at Google eight years ago. Once a Google ally, Uber emerged as a rival in the self-driving car market in early 2015 when it began developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles. Now, Waymo is trying to thwart that effort by persuading U.S. District Judge William Alsup to block Uber's self-car driving expansion on the grounds that it hinges on a high-tech heist. The case's outcome could alter the race to build self-driving cars that may transform transportation, reduce traffic deaths and launch a huge new industry. Laser Focus Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, claiming that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, stole its patented ideas. After the alleged theft, Levandowski left Google early last year to found a self-driving car startup called Otto that Uber bought for $680 million last August. But Uber is now presenting evidence that it began working on technology dramatically different from Waymo's more than a year before buying Otto. The dispute centers on a pivotal part of self-driving cars called LiDAR, an array of laser-based sensors that enable self-driving cars to see what's around them so they can safely navigate roads. In sworn declarations and diagrams, Uber argued that its engineers are working on a more sophisticated form of LiDAR than Waymo's. Among other things, Uber says its LiDAR uses four lenses for transmitting and receiving laser lights as opposed to the single lens in Waymo's version. "Waymo could not be more wrong, and Uber's design could not be more different," Uber's lawyers wrote in their rebuttal to the allegations. "And no wonder -- Uber's LiDAR was developed by a different team, using a different beam pattern, and leveraging different know-how." Weight of Evidence What's more, Uber says its custom-designed LiDAR system hasn't even been installed on the self-driving cars that it has been testing in Pittsburgh, Arizona and San Francisco. Instead, the company says it has been relying on LiDAR systems built by other vendors. Much of the information contained in Friday's filing was redacted to protect confidential business plans and secret technology. Uber may have its work cut out to sway Alsup, who has said in previous court hearings that Waymo has presented some of the strongest evidence he has seen in his judicial career. A hearing on Waymo's request for an injunction against Uber is scheduled for May 3. Although Waymo isn't suing him in this case, Levandowski will play a central role in how the lawsuit unfolds. Levandowski helped establish Google as an early leader in self-driving cars, earning him more than $120 million in incentive pay, according to information inadvertently revealed in court papers earlier this week. Before Levandowski defected from Google early last year start Otto, Waymo alleges he downloaded more than 14,000 documents containing trade secrets that is now helping Uber. After buying Otto, Uber put Levandowski in charge of Uber's self-driving project, a job that has been imperiled by this lawsuit. Alsup has warned that he may issue an order barring Levandowski from involvement in Uber's self-driving car division if he sides with Waymo. Uber says it hasn't found any evidence of ever possessing any of the files that Levandowski stands accused of stealing. Levandowski, meanwhile, has asserted his Fifth Amendment rights to protect himself if criminal charges are filed against him. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 Hands-On Next Article > Google Reportedly To Invest $877M in LG's OLED for Pixel Phones By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: APRIL 10 2017 Tech giant Google is said to be considering an investment of 1 trillion won, about $877 million, in LG Display to ensure access to a supply of flexible screens for the next generation of its smartphones. That investment is reportedly being made to ensure Google can produce a flexible screen version of its Pixel smartphone using LG Display's OLED (organic light-emitting diode) technology, according to reports from South Korea's ETNews and Yonhap News Agency. The arrangement would also provide LG Display with the upfront cash to ramp up production of such OLEDs. LG Display said its plastic screen technology is "the world's first flexible OLED display panel for smartphones." Reportedly, other companies, including Apple and Samsung, have also been looking at flexible screen smartphones as the technology continues to improve. 'Paradigm Shift to OLED' Citing "industry sources," ETNews yesterday reported that new Pixel phones featuring LG Display's OLED technology could be released in the second half of this year. ETNews added the two companies are also "collaborating on the development of foldable displays." In the past 18 months, LG Display has revealed plans to spend billions of dollars building new production facilities for OLED screens. In a July 2016 statement announcing the development of a new construction line at its plant in Paju, South Korea, CEO and vice chairman Sang-Beom Han said the company's goal is to lead an industry shift to OLED screens for mobile devices. "A paradigm shift to OLED represents both a challenge and an opportunity for the display industry," Han said in the statement. "LG Display is determined to become the leader in the fast-growing OLED market through timely investments to maximize efficiency." Fast-Expanding Market The Pixel smartphones, designed an built by Google, were launched in October as the company's replacement for its previous in-house Android brand, the Nexus. Google CEO Sundar Pichai (pictured above) described the Pixel and Pixel XL as ushering in an era for mobile devices led by artificial intelligence. The premium 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL currently feature AMOLED displays and have been compared favorably by many reviewers to Apple's iPhones. Google's phones are the first to be released with the company's Google Assistant AI technology built in. LG Display's plastic OLED technology for smartphones "enables the differentiated design values such as bendable, foldable and rollable. It is also 60 [percent lighter] than the glass to be more portable and unbreakable as it is not easily broken when dropped," according to the company. Samsung and LG Display are currently the leading manufacturers of flexible screen displays, and both have demonstrated the technology's use in prototype devices such as rollable video screens. Citing research from IHS DisplaySearch, LG Display last year said the 416 million flexible OLED devices could ship by 2020, compared to 59 million last year.

At the end of the day, only western news coming from mainstream media outlets will be labeled as true news and mainstream broadcaster will remain only newsmakers," Neu said. According to the lawmaker, readers should determine what is true or false by themselves rather than relying on a "commercial company, which is close to the government, especially, the US government." Google said the new feature was introduced as a part of its efforts to help combat the spread of misinformation and fake news while, according to the company's blog, the international fact-checking community currently consists of 115 organizations. In February, US President Donald Trump blocked from a briefing held by White House US and international media such as the New York Times, CNN, Los Angeles Times, Hill, Politico, BuzzFeed, Daily Mail, the BBC, and New York Daily News calling some of them a danger to the nation as they were allegedly publishing fake news.

(DeepMind) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains April 10, 2017 Google may be banned in China, but the intelligence of its relatives stretches everywhere. Seeking a more complete domination of the human race, the artificial intelligence algorithm developed by DeepMind—like Google, a unit of parent company Alphabet—will attend a five-day Go festival in China, beginning May 23. The algorithm, AlphaGo, will be the headline attraction of the “Future of Go Summit,” where DeepMind’s lineup of activities has all the trimmings of a circus. AlphaGo wrapped up a historic victory in March 2016 by becoming the first computer program to ever beat a top-level Go player. Go is a strategy board game that originated in China 2,500 years ago that is still played by 40 million people worldwide. By letting DeepMing flout its technology inside the country, China seems to be making a concession that it can learn from America’s Silicon Valley. The strong man To beat AlphaGo, DeepMind is putting forth China’s Ke Jie, who it calls the “world’s number one player.” He will face the algorithm in three games. AlphaGo in 2016 trounced South Korea’s Lee Sedol who was then labeled “the top Go player in the world over the past decade.” The trapeze Other matches will feature professional Go players teaming up with and against AlphaGo. In one game, two humans will play each other, but each has an AlphaGo teammate that takes over every other turn. DeepMind is heralding this as a melding between man and machine, saying it will “take the concept of ‘learning together’ quite literally.” The clown car A team of five professional players will also try to defeat AlphaGo. It’s unclear why DeepMind is fixated on establishing itself as a leader in a game widely viewed as just one benchmark in wider artificial intelligence research. DeepMind is leaving no Go stone unturned: The team has secretly tried to topple the online Go standings, and has hired a leading voice in Go to analyze how the AI thinks about the game. Maybe DeepMind needs to be beaten, so it can move on. Or maybe it’s the key to acceptance of Google in China, a vast untapped market for the company. Either way: Help us, Ke Jie. You’re our only hope. Most Popular Nasty, brutish, and short—what the next Korean War will look like Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

So far, the Trump administration is keeping them going. The cases have yet to be settled and the one against Google is now generating negative headlines in court. The development has surprised some people, considering the Trump administration’s pro-business posture. Experts say it is largely the result of the vacancy at the top. “It’s just the slowness of the appointment process,” says David Fortney, former acting solicitor for the Department of Labor during the George H.W. Bush administration. Andrew Puzder, Trump’s first pick for labor secretary, was forced to withdraw his nomination in February. He came under fire for employing an undocumented housekeeper and decades-old charges of domestic abuse. Alexander Acosta, Trump’s next pick for the role, has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. After that it could still be months before a new head is appointed for the agency’s Office of Federal Contact Compliance Programs (OFCCP), which is the group behind the tech lawsuits. “At this point, the decisions are being made largely by the senior career people, who are the ones who decided to file these lawsuits,” says Fortney. “I don’t think they have been reviewed closely by the new administration.” The Labor Department accused Oracle of paying white men more than other employees and claimed Palantir discriminated against Asian job applicants. The government agency said Google had not turned over enough compensation data for its employees. On Friday, the department continued to press Google in court. Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified that the agency found a “systemic” problem of Google underpaying women, according to The Guardian. The Labor Department confirmed the comment to CNNTech. The allegations come at a sensitive time for tech companies like Google, which have publicly talked up the need to boost diversity internally. But recent diversity reports show Silicon Valley remains predominantly white and male. “We vehemently disagree with Ms. Wipper’s claim,” Google said in a statement provided to CNNTech. “Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn’t provided any data, or shared its methodology.” The ongoing lawsuits stem from the three companies providing cloud or data services to federal agencies. As federal contractors, the companies are obligated to show the government that their hiring practices do not discriminate based on gender, race, religion, sexual orientation and more. Reps for Palantir did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Oracle declined to comment on this story. In an earlier statement, Oracle described the complaint as “politically motivated.” The two tech companies have close ties to the Trump administration. Peter Thiel, cofounder and chairman of Palantir, was an early Trump supporter and member of his transition team. Safra Catz, co-CEO of Oracle, was also on the transition team. Under Obama, the OFCCP was also “very aggressive” and “tried to push the envelope” on enforcement, according to one former Department of Labor employee who worked with the group and spoke on condition of anonymity. “We are not going to see that under Trump.” “It certainly appears that some of the OFCCP actions were filed hoping to secure quick headlines,” says Fortney. He expects the next agency head will reassess these suits to make sure the Labor Department’s “limited resources are being effectively deployed.” — Sara O’Brien contributed to this story.

Google provided the following examples of Fact Check in action: We can see clearly the format taken: What the claim is, who made the claim, and whether the claim is verified by a reputable source. Two early sources that are set to meet this standard, as shown in the screenshot above, are PolitiFact and Snopes. There is also an option for users to provide feedback just below the listing, if they have any qualms about the veracity of the claims made. This is an important point to note, as Google has explicitly stated that, “The entire process is conducted programmatically; human intervention only occurs when user feedback is filed.” Will Fact Check show up next to all News stories? No. The first step towards Fact Check showing up alongside your results is to add ClaimReview Schema.org tags to your page’s source code, as in the example below from Snopes: A full list of the guidelines can be found on the Google Developers blog, but I have summarized some of the most important aspects below: Fact checks associated with news articles can be shown in either News results or the combined search results view; all other fact checks can appear only in combined search results view. A single page can host multiple ClaimReview elements, each for a separate claim. (This occurs frequently on Snopes, for example.) If different reviewers on the page check the same fact, you can include a separate ClaimReview element for each reviewer’s analysis. The page hosting the ClaimReview element must have at least a brief summary of the fact check and the evaluation, if not the full text. You should host a specific ClaimReview on only one page on your site. Do not repeat the same fact check on multiple pages, unless they are variations of the same page (Mobile and Desktop, for example.) In essence, if your site makes a claim that you believe to be verifiable and true, add this markup and Google will take it into consideration. Even with these tags applied accurately, it is still far from guaranteed that Fact Check will kick into action. There is another, more substantial, bar to clear before you can gain the Fact Check tag. Which sites are eligible for Fact Check? Google has stated that only publishers that are “algorithmically determined to be an authoritative source of information” will be eligible to display the tags. This seems a little perplexing, if we dig just slightly beyond the surface. Some publishers will undoubtedly welcome the opportunity to substantiate their claims, believing that their articles contain the truth, as in this mildly humorous example provided by Google: But what of the hyperbolic news outlets that profiteer from making polemical – but clickable – claims? Would they be so willing to add these tags and jeopardize their traffic volumes, should the results show their news to be false? This seems unlikely. Therefore, would a site like PolitiFact have to reference those claims – and show them to be false – in order for the truth to surface in search results? This is essentially what PolitiFact and Snopes already endeavor to do, so it seems improbable that Fact Check will convert the unbelievers by dint of showing the same findings in Google results. Accusations of bias have already been leveled at both PolitiFact and Snopes, so it seems we will all have to arrive at a universal definition of what a fact is before this takes hold across the political spectrum. Moreover, Google has stated, “if a publisher or fact check claim does not meet [our] standards or honor [our] policies, we may, at our discretion, ignore that site’s markup.” There will undoubtedly be some sites upset by their lack of inclusion, casting, as it does, serious aspersions on their reliability as a news provider.

Given the nature of both the Google and Facebook platforms, they are in a tricky position. Pressure has been applied at government level to push them into action over ‘fake news’, but with millions of pieces of content going live every minute, this is not a simple task. Furthermore, is it the place of a technology company to decide on our behalf what is true or false? Google is understandably cautious about this launch and made the following statement: ”These fact checks are not Google’s and are presented so people can make more informed judgements. Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it’s still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.” We can see here an attempt, echoing Facebook’s recent launch, to place some responsibility on users to “make informed judgements”. Fact Check is a step in the right direction – but this is not a battle that Google can win on its own.

And honestly, we don’t even know how this will work. My guess is that you’ll be able to say, “OK, Google, what’s Kellen’s day look like,” or something similar to specify which user you want to check-in on. Or maybe Google will learn your voice and just let you know as it hears you speak to it. That would actually be a much better implementation. Either way, this feature will be important, especially as Google tries to turn Home into a both a shopping and personal assistant. Having different profiles within a unit could lead to better person-by-person control and maybe even a level of privacy that is currently lacking. In related news to Google Home, Google has pulled the shopping list feature from Google Keep. They actually started doing this last week, but have only this morning posted to their support site about the change. The shopping list functionality won’t be dead, though. Going forward, you’ll have a dedicated “Google Shopping List,” within Google Assistant or Express (Google’s shopping service). The list will be accessible within Home or Express apps and you should be able to find it by swiping out the side menu and tapping the Shopping List option. From there, you can shop your list and check off or delete items. Via: Google Support [2] Post navigation Previous StoryLG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition to Receive Android Wear 2.0 Update in Early May Next StoryRunIQ From New Balance to Receive Android Wear 2.0 This Week NexusMan This is exciting news, however, what I find to be very odd is the following: a few weeks ago people all over this site and the internet were up in arms over what they called a Beauty & the Beast ad, when someone online posted a video of himself asking about his day, and Google Home mentioned Beauty & the Beast was opening…which some, including myself, debated whether that was actually an ad. Anyway, fast forward to a couple days ago and I asked Google Home to tell me about my day, and it broadcast not 1, but TWO (2) bonafide, real live, traditional, actual, no doubt about it ADS for Ace Hardware, 1 actual ad for Merryl Lynch and another ad for a podcast that I do not subscribe to….and not a peep from anyone on this board or around the internet about that. WTH? I can’t be the only person who’s now getting real ads on this thing. usnmustanger So it would appear that the new shopping list isn’t even actually in the Google Home app. Tapping “Shopping List” in the app actually opens up a Google Express webpage in whatever browser you choose (I don’t set a default, but if you do, it’ll open in that one) where your shopping list now exists. It did import stuff from the Keep shopping list, but this definitely seems like a hackish step backwards. This is pretty bad from a UX perspective. I understand trying to get customers to buy more stuff via their Express marketplace, but this is a bad move by Google, since a very large number of us have ZERO interest in ever using Express. Cory S I’m pretty much over my Home. It just fails at too many things. My favorite is “hey Google, play different music” “I’m sorry, play something else isn’t supported yet” BaldyPal So does my wife need to install the HOME app now? an app she would never use before b/c i maintain the Google Home’s? and now i have to teach her a new way of doing something for the 3rd time. meaning, Google Now would update a prenamed list, then Google Home only would update it’s Assistant Shopping List, and now it’s moving? i harped on twitter about this yesterday. i hope to God i don’t have to put my google account on my wife’s phone just so she can see the shopping list. AND WHAT ABOUT ANDROID WEAR? i use Keep on Moto 360 all the time in the grocery store. Joe Centineo Android Wear 100%. Being able to tell the Home to add something to the list, and then pull up that list on the watch while shopping is a huge convenience. Taking that away is breaking the seamless connection that Google was beginning to achieve with these 3 services. Swauger Not happy that they took away the Google Shopping List. Our Google Home is set up to my wife’s account. We both use Google Keep and she shared her Google Shopping List with me. It was very nice when I went to the store to look at the list and see what we needed in the house. Ryan So Im confused. Whats happening to the shopping list? The girlfriend use that constantly and I hope they dont break/ruin it, even for a few days. BaldyPal And now I’m​ wondering if I can still use the KEEP app on Android Wear while grocery shopping. Good_Ole_Pinocchio By the time version 2 is out all the services I wanted will be ready. So I’ll wait zarxic One of the biggest disappointments with Google Assistant is the steps backwards from Google Now. I have a few different shopping lists and LOVED being able to say to add an item to a specific list. These lists were already shared with my family. Now I get to have one big jumbled shopping list in yet ANOTHER location. No thanks. I’ve actually changed my default language to go back to Google Now, until Assistant becomes available outside of the US, it works for me. thatgeekdad I hate this. Yes I love the multi support but we as a family definitely use the Google Keep shopping lists for my family. We use it for groceries as well as what to get from Home Depot for house projects, and more. I hope they bring this back fast or we will need to definitely be a Amazon Echo family. JSo You should still be able to share grocery lists. When I tried adding something to my list this morning it added it in keep and had a notice saying Grocery lists are changing or something like that. Went to the more info page and if I remember right, it mentioned something about sharing lists with others. Thanassi Karageorgiou “…or we will need to definitely be a Amazon Echo family.” Shots fired! vonedaddy I will buy your google home for cheap! Kimberlyelafferty Google is paying $97 per hour!

Sangro Azul Sorry to be off topic, but just wanted to know if anyone else has had their micro sd card corrupted post-nougat update? Happened to me once and it’s happened to my wife twice now (the second time using a brand new micro sd card and new s7 phone). We’re sending the phone back to Samsung. PKells Yup. Was able to retrieve the data off the micro SD card at least, but the update did corrupt it and had to get a new one. I’ve read it’s best practice to unmount the micro SD card prior to updating the OS…But of course I only found this out after I had the issue. Sangro Azul I did unmount the sd card the second time and it happened again!! J Harrell Not so much a micro SD card, but a post-Nougat update sent my N9 into a bootloop. Thankfully, I was able to fix it and I had a recent backup, so didn’t lose anything. Ryan N This was the one thing keeping me from picking one up. Now it seems practical. Morgan Glassco Well I would think multi-user support would do voice recognition. We ‘train’ our devices to recognize our voices, would in be stretch to think it could recognize Suzy vs Tom when someone says “Whats on my calendar today” Swauger I doubt it. Because when I say “Okay Google” to talk to the Google Home all of the android phones go off in my house. Mine, my wife’s and the kids. Would be nice but I don’t see it happening. Morgan Glassco Responding to Okay Google is one thing, providing “personal information” may be different. Take for example, you can pick up just about any phone and take a picture. But if it is locked you cannot see the prior photos. Your wife’s phone might tell you the weather, but maybe not read you the last text. At least this is my thinking of how it would work. aetmo buuut pixel shopping list still goes to google keep. brilliant WiscoNative Going to start calling it Goodle Ssaistant, because they’ve got this all ass backwards now… aetmo i see what you did thur Killa Should have said: “I see what you did ereht or ruht” 🙂 About Droid Life We consider ourselves to have the greatest Android community in the world, here at Droid Life.

Google has managed to get the entire Android community enthusiastic when it announced that Android O is already under works. Even better, Google simultaneously started rolling out Android 7.1.2 Nougat. The best thing though is the fact that Android 7.1.2 Nougat includes this month’s security patch. Nonetheless, the update is being rolled out OTA (over the air) and Android users should keep their eyes peeled at their notifications panel. Android 7.1.2 Nougat Pixel C owners were the first ones to receive this incremental maintenance release but now Pixel and Nexus owners are next in line. To be more exact, the following devices are eligible to receive Google’s latest software update: Pixel XL, Pixel, Pixel C, Nexus Player, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P.  Sadly, Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 have been officially excluded from Google’s list. The Android parent has announced that it has developed this update with one purpose in mind, and that’s to enhance the Android experience through tweaks and fixes. However, Google decided to also include some features for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P as well. The aforementioned smartphones have received fingerprint gestures support but that’s not all, Google is also going to provide them with its own virtual assistant during the upcoming future. April Security Bulletin Google is known for being very serious when it comes to user security. Lately, the internet seems to be filled with malware and viruses around each corner. Google is aware of that and that’s why it keeps on rolling out a steady stream of security patch. In fact, many are saying that Google’s motto is “another month, another update”. Nonetheless, this month’s security bulletin is very important because it fixes 102 vulnerabilities. Out of the 102 vulnerabilities, 15 of them are considered as being critical. Hackers can exploit those vulnerabilities and get access to Android powered smartphones through malware or ransomware. On the bright side, there are no reports to show that someone was affected by those exploits and Google’s security patch will get rid of them completely. It’s great seeing that Google puts such a high price on security, especially since everyone tends to store important documents and pictures on their smartphones.

Google is a multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products. [Denis Linine / Shutterstock, Inc.]    Newspaper Launches Petition To Stop Google And Facebook From ‘Destroying Journalism’ Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 12:37 PM 04/10/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5583978 A British media outlet launched a petition Monday to “stop” Google and Facebook from “destroying journalism” by hogging digital ad revenue from traditional news publishers. Press Gazette, a publication primarily focused on the news industry, is urging the chief executives of Google and Facebook to change its advertisement revenue system because, it says, if news publishers aren’t able to compete with Google and Facebook for ad revenue and have to cut staff or shut down, then good journalism will suffer. “By 2020 it has been estimated that 71 per cent of the money spent on digital advertising in the UK will go to Google and Facebook,” the Press Gazette’s official petition reads. “We are concerned that your commercial dominance will drive news publishers who increasingly rely on digital advertising out of business,” the petition adds, directly addressing the two companies. “This will be bad for you (because you will no longer be able to use their content) and bad for society because we will all be less well informed.” Google is expected to make $72.69 billion in ad revenues in 2017, while Facebook is estimated to make $33.76 billion, according to market research company eMarketer. Combined, the two companies account for 90 percent of the new ad revenue. “In the space of a decade the share of the UK advertising market going to UK regional and national newspapers has declined from nearly a half to little more than 10 per cent,” Press Gazette editor Dominic Ponsford said in a statement announcing the petition. “Both Google and Facebook make much of their money through people viewing and sharing copyrighted journalistic content on their platforms. In exchange they return almost no value to journalism creators.” Google and Facebook’s digital ad dominance is why the Press Gazette’s campaign is accompanied with a “Duopoly” logo (a play off of the popular board game “Monopoly”) featuring a figure with the likeness of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. We have launched a new Press Gazette campaign – Duopoly: Stop Google and Facebook destroying journalism https://t.co/dMAzQq0N0S pic.twitter.com/5hZLXxpa5I — Dominic Ponsford (@Domponsford) April 10, 2017 Press Gazette provided a current example of the gap in monetary rewards and diligent journalistic work. Channel 4 News generated billions of video views on Facebook, much of it through footage of Syria obtained in dangerous conditions. But it’s Facebook that takes most of the advertising revenue, while Channel 4 gets “almost nothing.” “Google and Facebook need to adopt a formula where a fair proportion of the search and display advertising income they make from journalism is returned to publishers so it can be reinvested in content creation,” the petition announcement continues. Other suggestions include identifying “fake news” and “fake advertising,” promoting “accurate professionally-produce journalism,” and detecting fictional content that purports to be legitimate news. It recommends “working with regulators” in order to figure out a “white list of sites which reach the necessary standards for accuracy.” (RELATED: Facebook’s New Arbiter Of News Is A Former CNN Anchor Who Can Barely Hide Her Anti-Trump Bias) Along with the petition for changes, Press Gazette says it will be investigating the impact Google and Facebook have on journalism and the news, while also providing a forum for debate. The outlet does concede that the two companies are in a great position to foster fruitful and productive news, since they further publishers’ abilities to reach more brands and people. “But if that is at the expense of the advertising income which consumer publishers need to survive then it is not a price worth paying,” the release reads. (RELATED: Facebook Exec: We Are ‘Just Getting Started’ With ‘Fake News’ Battle) Google and Facebook both made announcements in recent months introducing ways to help purge or minimize fake news on their platforms. Google’s “Fact Checkers” include outlets Snopes and Politifact, two publications that purport to be completely unbiased, but have many examples of dubious validation efforts. Facebook, which has also shown interest in Snopes, rolled out a feature Thursday that offers users tips on how to spot “fake news” including checking for other reports on the topic and scrutinizing the formatting.

The technology company is being accused of discriminating against its female employees by the United States Department of Labor, according to the Guardian. The department, as part of an ongoing investigation, has collect information it says suggests Google’s salaries for women violate federal employment laws. “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,” Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, testified in court in San Francisco on Friday. The California-based company, though, reportedly has denied the allegations, and recently said it’s closed its wage gap. Let’s make every day #EqualPayDay.

As a federal contractor, Google is required to allow the government to inspect information about its compliance with equal opportunity laws, though the Labor Department claims it has repeatedly refused to do so.

Previous Article Beer, Bots and Broadcasts: Companies Start Using AI in the Cloud Next Article Guarding the Guards Themselves—The Truth Behind Security Devices Inside an Equinix data center in Silicon Valley (Photo: Equinix) Cloud Computing, Data Center World, Equinix, Featured Equinix Exec: We Spent $17B on Data Centers, but Cloud Giants Spend Much More by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on April 6, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Equinix, one of the world’s two largest data center providers, has spent $17 billion over its 18 years in business to expand its global data center empire, including construction and acquisitions, but cloud giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon each easily beat that number in two years’ time. That’s according to Peter Ferris, chief evangelist at Equinix, who made the comparison during his keynote at Data Center World Wednesday. He offered the numbers to illustrate just how real the shift of IT infrastructure from on-premise data centers to the cloud is. “Google, and Microsoft, and Amazon are each spending more than $10 billion dollars a year at this point building data centers,” he said. “Either they’re all crazy, or this transition is real and it will continue.” The figure is a reasonable approximation. Cloud providers don’t disclose their exact data center spend publicly, but at least Google and Microsoft execs have recently shared approximate figures, and they’re similar. Google’s trailing three-year capital investment is about $26.6 billion, Urs Hölzle, the company’s senior VP for technical infrastructure, said in his keynote address at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco in March. The bulk of that investment is in infrastructure. It’s not unusual for Microsoft to spend more than $2 billion on infrastructure in a single quarter. They’re spending this money to bulk up data center capacity and network bandwidth to absorb enterprise application workloads, as companies increasingly rethink the necessity of owning and operating their own data centers, and Ferris has a front-row view of this shift. Like many other data center service providers, Equinix has positioned its facilities as places where companies can connect their corporate networks directly to the networks of cloud giants. This option is more secure and provides better performance than connecting to the cloud through the public internet. Reducing operational cost isn’t the only reason companies are shifting to the cloud. Every industry is undergoing a shift to digital tools and products, and the distributed nature of hyper-scale clouds makes it easier to get those digital tool and products to their end users. Companies of all types have to rethink both their infrastructure and their business strategies in the digital world, Ferris said. “No matter what business you’re in, it’s conceivable that you will be disrupted.” More Data Center World coverage: This Hacker Can Talk His Way inside a Data Center Radware Discovers BrickerBot, a New Permanent DoS Botnet Microsoft: OCP Forced Hardware Makers to Rethink Interoperability Finding the Sweet Spot for Your Data Center Automation: Not Just for DevOps Three Reasons Network Security Policy Management is a Big Deal Previous Article Beer, Bots and Broadcasts: Companies Start Using AI in the Cloud Next Article Guarding the Guards Themselves—The Truth Behind Security Devices Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

The Finnish firm has witnessed some very turbulent times in the past ten years, but that has not deterred its ambitions of making a comeback. Now, with HMD Global, the Finnish brand is set to make a comeback by offering Android phones, with a little help from Google. Hermann / Pixabay How HMD plans to revive the Nokia brand HMD executives explained to Gulf News how they plan to offer the Android phones that fans have long been waiting for. Per Ekman, HMD Global’s vice president for the Middle East and North Africa, promised that the new handsets will retain all the brand qualities that the buyers loved in Nokia products. Explaining how their new strategic partnership with Google will help the brand make a comeback, Ekman said a majority of the smartphones on the market do not offer the Android OS in its real form, as vendors add a “skin on top of the OS.” But they will be giving consumers the latest version and the patches as soon as Google issues them. “We and Google will jointly enhance the Nokia brand to put the right kind of inputs into the phone, including Google Assistant,” Ekman said. How offering pure Android helps Nokia and Google Offering the latest and purest Android version will give Nokia phones an edge over rivals, as currently only a small fraction of Android phones run on the latest version of the OS (Android Nougat 7.1 is available on less than 1% devices), notes PhoneArena. It sounds good, but offering a pure Android experience is something that even Google is not doing anymore. Last year, the search giant announced that it is planning to offer a more customized OS for its Android phones, notes BGR. And the Pixel handset that came after that was a good example of it. It included some features that were not available on the older Nexus models. However, working with a popular brand which is still adored by millions around the globe could help Google as well, especially at a time when its biggest Android partner is on an anti-Android drive. Samsung’s Bixby is a potential threat to Google Assistant and to Google in the long run. Thus, working with Nokia and HMD could work well for Android’s future. So far, so good So far, HMD has received encouraging responses from buyers. According to Ekman, more than 1 million units of the Nokia 6 were sold in pre-registration within 23 seconds of the announcement. The phone was launched in January in China, which, according to Ekman, is the “toughest market.” Analysts are also bullish on Nokia’s prospects. Clement Teo, principal analyst at Ovum, believes the Finnish brand will make a place for itself in the crowded mid-tier segment. In an email to ZDNet, Teo said, “Producing a well-designed mid-market smartphone will allow them to be a strong alternative to the likes of other mid-market smartphone players like Huawei, Oppo, Samsung, and Xiaomi.” Tags: Android Google HMD Nokia Load Comments Latest News From ValueWalk How A Budget Chinese Airline Carved A Niche In Japan Literal meaning of Indian states and role of religion Adam Parks: How To Select & Prepare Sustainably-Raised Meats Adam Wyden Of ADW Capital On Micro-Cap Value Investing Copyright © 2016 ValueWalk - Privacy Policy Follow Us: Developed by ValueWalk Team Sponsored Content - Resource Center

But Nokia, under the stewardship of HMD Global, could well bring back elements of what made Google’s Nexus phones so popular with users. Things like stock Android, fast updates and competitive pricing. In a recent release, HMD noted it is putting in place a new strategic partnership with Google and Foxconn to further its gains in the mobile space during 2017/18. “Most of the smartphones in the market do not have the Android OS in the way it should be,” said HMD Global’s vice president for the Middle East and North Africa Per Ekman. “Vendors are adding a skin on top of the OS. Consumers have the right to have the latest version of the OS, and we will be pushing the latest version and the patches as soon as it is available from Google.” “We and Google will jointly enhance the Nokia brand to put the right kind of inputs into the phone, including Google Assistant,” he said. Nokia’s current phones –  the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 – all run a pretty clean version of Android. But these handsets appear to be just the tip of the iceberg; HMD wants to get Google onboard to help push its Nokia agenda and that should be music to the ears of any Nokia/Android fan. And God knows Google needs another, more manageable Android partner; one that can be groomed and play ball. Samsung is Google’s biggest Android partner by a country mile, but the South Korean tech giant makes no bones about how much it wants to get away from Android and Google’s authority. TizenOS was the first step in Samsung’s path away from Google’s Android OS and the launch of Bixby, a direct competitor to Google Assistant, was another. Samsung has made ZERO bones about its intent to get out from under Google’s control, meaning it is now only a matter of time before it does. Plus, the Nokia brand is still immensely popular with millions of people the globe over. Just look at the frenzy HMD created in the run up to MWC with the launch of the rebooted Nokia 3310 – one of the best marketing tricks EVER – and its trio of Android-powered Nokia phones. Search volumes around Nokia’s Android phones are huge as well, and this tell us two things: 1) A LOT of people are very interested in the Nokia brand and 2) once Nokia does release a proper flagship phone, a lot of people, providing it is a solid release, will likely buy it. No wonder Google’s interested in working more closely with HMD to bring Nokia back into contention.

Yu | 00:01 UTC+8 April 11, 2017 | Print Edition FACEBOOK recently launched a new Instant Games platform as part of its Messenger app. Instead of downloading yet another game from Apple iTunes or Google Play, users can now play games directly through Messenger, without ever leaving Facebook. These light-weight, HTML5-based games are designed to be “asynchronous,” where players take turns to make a move without the need to be online at the same time. Think of it like playing chess. Popular titles include arcade classics such as “PAC-MAN” to more modern favorites such as “EverWing.” But the idea for a messenger app to bundle games and other app-like services is not new. China’s WeChat has been doing this for years. Owned by the country’s largest gaming company Tencent, WeChat was initially modeled off WhatsApp, but has since integrated social media with free messaging and calls. Today, WeChat has more than 800 million monthly active users, a number larger than the entire population of Europe, let alone the United States. App evolution In China there has been a slew of apps that bore some resemblance to their Western counterparts, but have since evolved into entirely different species. Even if the apps shared the same original idea, they have changed so much that to equate WeChat to WhatsApp today would be akin to mistaking a bamboo-chewing giant panda for a honey-loving American black bear. In the West, Facebook and Google have grown obsessed over mobile advertising, amassing user data to fine-tune their increasingly powerful algorithms to better target end consumers. In China, Internet companies have found new ways to get consumers to pay, either by charging transaction fees or through in-app purchases. WeChat decidedly focused on connectivity, morphing what was once a stand-alone messaging platform into an indispensable mobile portal for making payments, booking doctor appointments, filing police reports, hailing taxis, accessing banking services, video conferencing, playing games, and much more. Shaking the phone has proven a popular way to make new friends who are also users. Waving it at a television allows WeChat to recognize the current program and for viewers to interact. WeChat is Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Zynga, all wrapped up into one. “Quite frankly, the trope that China copies the US hasn’t been true for years, and in mobile it’s the opposite: The US often copies China,” said Ben Thompson, the founder of the tech research firm Stratechery. Take mobile payment as an example. In 2013, WeChat debuted its first payment system. Users can send each other money, pay utility bills, and even invest in a wealth fund through the app. Its parent company, Tencent, invested billions of dollars in ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing (China’s Uber) and group-buying service Meituan-Dianping (China’s Groupon), so that users can order a car or shop for group deals without leaving WeChat. Over the past years, Tencent has further added traditional retailers like McDonald’s, 7-Eleven and Uniqlo to accept WeChat Pay. One of the most popular features on WeChat Pay is the “red envelope,” which lets users send virtual packets stuffed with digital cash to family and friends during Chinese New Year. Between last February 7 and 12, some 32 billion red envelopes were exchanged, up from 3.2 billion the previous holiday period. As impressive as this might seem, however, WeChat Pay remains an underdog. Alibaba still commands a 68 percent market share against the challenger’s 21 percent. But in the midst of the ongoing payment battle, China saw mobile transactions surge to US$235 billion, surpassing the US for the first time last year. Core rigidities Chinese Internet giants are fast becoming all-encompassing super apps. Facebook now has some catching up to do. “For the Facebook Messenger app, the best way to understand their road map is to look at WeChat,” Thompson further asserted. If only it were that easy for Facebook to play copycat. In studying why established companies sometimes find themselves trapped within an existing business model, Harvard Business School’s Clayton Christensen noted the four crucial elements that underpin any successful strategy: value proposition, resources, processes and profit formula. To Christensen, these four elements are the fundamental building blocks of any successful business. Here is the flip side. Once these four elements emerge, they impose incredible inertia and make it extremely difficult for top executives to break the formula. Core capabilities turn into core rigidities. Future weaknesses are embedded in current strengths. This is why emulating the success of WeChat is going to be much harder for Facebook. As one American venture capitalist puts it, WeChat is there “at every point of your daily contact with the world, from morning until night.” In a country where more people use the Internet via their mobiles than in America, Brazil and Indonesia combined, WeChat is particularly attractive to advertisers. When BMW launched the first-ever ad on the WeChat Moments page (which is akin to a Facebook feed) of selected users, no one complained about commercial intrusion on privacy. An uproar instead ensued from non-recipients demanding to know why they had not received the ad. The race to become ubiquitous But the reason why big banks, airlines, hotels and restaurant chains have no issues in signing up for WeChat was because the company doesn’t store end user data. All WeChat did was open up its platform to an application programming interface, or API. WeChat’s proposition is simple: “Your customer’s data stays with you. We are only interested in providing the user interface.” This makes sense. The last thing WeChat wants is to deal with some local governments who keep knocking on its door demanding access to user data. A couple of years back, Facebook had built a massive gaming platform for desktops, thanks to developers like EA and Zynga. People bought virtual goods from games like Farmville and Cityville. In 2011, Facebook made about 12 percent of its total revenue from games. But as users shifted to mobile, Facebook was unable to pursue gamers. Today, only about 3 percent of Facebook’s revenue comes from games. Therefore the move by Facebook to increase gaming should hardly be a surprise. But Facebook’s mainstream business will always be advertising. To feed that monster, customer information, artificial intelligence and data mining will always be of top priority. Paradoxically, these are anathema at WeChat. The rise of WeChat to become an all-in-one app depends critically on its lack of interest of storing customer data. Launching a gaming business model may help Facebook to expand its scope. But it would be a stretch to say Facebook would soon become “WeChat of America.”   Howard Yu is professor of strategic management and innovation at IMD.

Welcome to Google 2017, where far-Left ideologues who manage the company’s media operations are set to decide what their readers can and cannot see, based solely on political ideology. As reported by The Guardian, Google – which is following Facebook’s lead – has tweaked its news-gathering algorithm to weed out so-called “fake news” that it claims is spreading “misinformation” via the Internet: Google is to start displaying fact-checking labels in its search results to highlight news and information that has been vetted and show whether it is considered to be true or false, as part of its efforts to help combat the spread of misinformation and fake news.  The fact-checking feature, which was first introduced to Google News in the UK and US in October, will now be displayed as an information box in general search results as well as news search results globally. How will this work? According to the report, there will be small segments of information displayed regarding claims made in certain news reports on particular sites, in addition to so-called fact-checking of the highlighted claims. (RELATED: Google, YouTube waging “demonetization” WAR on alternative media to bankrupt independent journalism) In other words, if a Google (or Facebook) editor believes the claims to be false – such as, say, a claim by us that there is no evidence to support the Democratic and establishment media narrative that “Russia hacked the election to help Donald Trump,” even if we offer proof in our reporting – that story will be accompanied with a “fake news” label. The next step, mind you, will be out-and-out censorship, along the lines of what CNN host Don Lemon did last week after the bombshell story broke outing former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice as the one who unmasked Trump campaign and transition team members, for political purposes. Because he is an Obama sycophant and because he believes the story to be false and a “diversion” from the real story (Trump-Putin “collusion” – which didn’t happen), he made the decision to purposefully ignore it. Nevertheless, Google and Facebook are defending their decisions to arbitrarily assign ‘fake news’ labels to any stories they don’t like or don’t agree with. “With thousands of new articles published online every minute of every day, the amount of content confronting people can be overwhelming,” said Cong Yu of Google and Justin Kosslyn from fact-check partner Jigsaw, in a statement. “And unfortunately, not all of it is factual or true, making it hard for people to distinguish fact from fiction. (RELATED: Google To Start Flagging Content Found To Be “Offensive” By Crybully Snowflakes Who Are Triggered By Reality) “As we make fact checks more visible in search results, we believe people will have an easier time reviewing and assessing these fact checks, and making their own informed opinions.” Let’s be clear about one thing: There certainly is a fair amount of fake news being published online, but much of it is coming from the Marxist media establishment that includes networks like CNN, as well as legacy newspapers like The New York Times and the Washington Post. Time and again, in the lead-up to the Nov. 8 election with fake polls showing a massive Hillary Clinton win, to fake news reports claiming Russia used hundreds of websites to spread anti-Clinton propaganda, to the wholly discredited “Russia hacked the election to help Trump” narrative, it’s been the so-called “mainstream media” that has been discredited. But because it shares a far-Left Marxist ideology with the founders of Google and Facebook, the fact-filled alternative media – which regularly publishes reports that diminish Alt-Left Democrats – are the ones regularly punished. If you seriously want to avoid being duped by the social media giants who now actively censoring real media on their news feeds, bypass them and monitor Censored.news throughout the day, where truth is always available.

That Addiction To Your iPhone Isn’t Accidental… By Arron Hirst 15 hours ago Share Tweet If you find it increasingly harder to leave your smartphone in another room, or resist the urge to check Twitter, Facebook or Snapchat at every given opportunity throughout the day, you may have fell victim to a little known technique known more commonly by those involved in its inception as brain hacking. Tristan Harris, former Google product manager (credit: CBS News) As 60 Minutes’ Anderson Cooper explains: Have you ever wondered if all those people you see staring intently at their smartphones — nearly everywhere, and at all times — are addicted to them? According to a former Google product manager you are about to hear from, Silicon Valley is engineering your phone, apps and social media to get you hooked. While it may seem obvious to say that we are all “addicted” to our mobile technology nowadays, when it comes to your smartphone habits – it turns out that there may actually be some science behind getting you to behave in a certain way … Now someone is speaking out about Silicon Valley’s closely guarded secret. That person is Google’s former product manager, Tristan Harris, and he claims that so-called ‘brain hacking’ isn’t just real – it’s a design principle that can be “embedded inside of all these products.” “There’s a whole playbook of techniques that get used to get you using the product for as long as possible,” the former product manager explained to Cooper, specifically referencing Snapchat’s recently introduced “Streaks” feature that counts how many days (consecutively) a user has been conversing with their peers through the app. And it’s features like this, Harris explains, that –coupled with introducing a general mentality of not wanting to look bad to others, or break personal routine– are systematically working to “shap[e] the thoughts[,] feelings and actions of people.” It’s a long but worthwhile read to start off your Monday. / Image Credit: CBS News / CBS News More info iPhone Only Snapchat FREE Continue Reading You may also like... iBooks: Great Books.

Yesterday GOOG: 824.73 0.06 Best Android phones you can buy [April 2017] Ben Schoon - Apr. 10th 2017 9:33 am PT @NexusBen Android Samsung Galaxy S8 LG G6 best phones View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Looking for a new smartphone? There are dozens upon dozens of great options on the market today, but finding the best of the best can be a bit difficult. We’ve seen some great launches through the year and more should be coming soon too, so let’s take a look at the best Android smartphones you can buy as of April 2017. The best gifts for Android users New for April: LG G6 One of the more impressive debuts to come out of MWC 2017 was the LG G6 ─ the company’s new bezel-light flagship for the year. After the failure that was the LG G5, the company needs a win, and it might just have that in the G6. Packed inside of the LG G6 is a Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, wireless charging, USB-C, Android Nougat, Google Assistant, and a 3,300 mAh battery. However, the biggest story here is what you can actually see. First of all, the LG G6 has super thin bezels on all sides, allowing that 5.7-inch display to fit into the footprint of a phone with a much smaller display. Then, there’s the removal of the modular components, making room for IP68 protection against dust and water. The LG G6 is a pretty solid smartphone, but it’s not perfect. As we noted in our review, the device still lacks in certain areas such as performance. That said, it’s still a fantastic device. You can order now from Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, B&HPhoto, and Best Buy. Samsung Galaxy S8/Galaxy S8+ (Coming this month) The biggest debut in April is, of course, the all-new Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Following the official reveal late last month, the hype is real for Samsung’s latest flagship. The new bezel-light phones usher in a new design language for Samsung, further revised software with new features like Bixby, and other various improvements. This is especially true when it comes to the screen. The Galaxy S8 is a 5.8-inch device where the S8+ is a 6.2-inch monster, or at least, it would be without this design. Thanks to the thin bezels all around, the S8 and S8+ are both very compact compared to devices with similar or even smaller screen sizes. It’s impressive both in pictures and in person. Under the hood, the Galaxy S8 packs the Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a microSD card slot. There’s also USB-C for quick charging and data transfer, as well as video output via Samsung’s DeX dock which offers up a full desktop environment when plugged into the necessary peripherals. The S8 also packs Nougat out the box with a cleaner software build. Pricing is unknown at this time, but Samsung is set to open up sales of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ through all major carriers starting on April 21st. Pre-orders are open now via Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Best Buy, and Sprint. Huawei P10/P10 Plus MWC 2017 also saw the early debut of Huawei’s flagship P Series device for 2017 ─ the Huawei P10. The P10 isn’t a massive departure from 2016’s P9, but it still brings some welcome enhancements. First, the P10 has picked up the same great Leica dual-camera system from the Mate 9, and has also brought several new color options to the table, as well as a new, unique metal build. Further, the P10 offers EMUI 5.1 and a new front-facing fingerprint sensor that can double as navigation buttons. The P10 runs on top of the Kirin 960 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3,200 mAh battery with Nougat and a 5.1-inch 1080p display. The P10 Plus, on the other hand, brings 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a much bigger 3,750mAh battery, under a 5.5-inch QHD display. Unfortunately, we don’t have any details just yet on what the P10 and P10 Plus will cost. Both phones are available now overseas, but they won’t be coming to the US. You can read our full review here. Honor 8 Pro Another option that won’t be coming to the US, but is quite solid is the Honor 8 Pro. Announced this month for European markets, the Honor 8 Pro packs a metal build, dual-camera, powerful specs into a fairly affordable device. Under the hood, you’ll find the Kirin 960 chipset, 6GB of RAM, a massive 4,000 mAh battery, USB-C, and 64GB of speedy UFS 2.1 storage. Of course, Android Nougat and EMUI 5.1 are also included. Pre-orders are live now for European customers. FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR: Google Pixel/Pixel XL When talking about the best Android phones, there’s no way to avoid talking about the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. These two smartphones, designed by Google from the ground up, show off the best that the company has to offer, and it’s impressive. While not perfect, Google’s efforts with the Pixel show just how good Android can be, both in terms of stability, performance, and the overall experience. The Pixel packs top-tier specs including the Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32 or 128GB of storage, and the breathtaking 12.3MP camera on the back. Google’s services are pre-loaded out of the box, the latest version of Android is pushed immediately, and Google Assistant is showcased front and center. Other perks include the 24/7 support, unlimited full resolution photo and video backups, and support for Google’s all new Daydream VR experience. Pricing for the Pixel starts at $649 for the 5-inch variant and $769 for the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Add $100 to either for the 128GB storage tier. Monthly financing is available both through the Google Store and Verizon Wireless. Huawei Mate 9 (US Release) As expected, Huawei launched the Mate 9 in the US market at CES 2017 for the pretty reasonable price of $599. Packed inside of its gorgeous aluminum design, the Mate 9 has Huawei’s in-house Kirin 960 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a dual-camera system, a 5.9-inch 1080p display, and Android Nougat. Alongside Google’s latest OS, Huawei has also included the latest version of its EMUI software skin, and it’s finally pretty good. The Mate 9 will also be updated in the coming weeks to include Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant in place of the Pixel-locked Google Assistant. We’ll be revisiting the device soon, but in the meantime, you can read our full review here and buy the phone from Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo, Jet.com, or Newegg for $599 unlocked. It works on any GSM carrier including T-Mobile and AT&T. LG V20 If you want a big, feature-rich phone that doesn’t explode, the LG V20 might be your best bet. Packing a 5.7-inch Quad HD IPS display, Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3,200 mAh removable battery, the V20 is a power user’s phone without question. This is only emphasized with the dual-camera system on the back which can take standard and wide-angle pictures as well as bringing enhanced stabilization in video. Entertainment only gets better with the built-in 32-bit HiFi DAC which makes listening to music a joy. The LG V20 is one of the best smartphones we’ve used this year, but the most surprising thing about it is the price. While a similar option from Samsung, Apple, or Google could cost you well upwards of $800, the V20 averages out at about $770. Pricing varies by carrier, landing at $672 on Verizon at its lowest point and $830 on AT&T and its highest. Monthly pricing across all major carriers lands at around $28 a month and the phone is available via Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Sprint. You can also pick it up unlocked. We’ve also seen some pretty spectacular deals on the phone, cutting the price by hundreds. OnePlus 3T Announced toward the end of 2016, the OnePlus 3T is the successor to the OnePlus 3, although it’s really just a slight refresh. Compared to the OnePlus 3 the 3T brings the updated Snapdragon 821 chipset, a larger 3,400 mAh battery, a new color variant, and an updated 16MP front facing camera sensor. Aside from that, the OnePlus 3T is the same as the OnePlus 3, bringing Dash Charge fast charging, a 5.5-inch 1080p Optic AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, and USB-C — all wrapped up in that aluminum chassis. Starting at $439, it’s slightly more expensive than the OnePlus 3 was, but not without reason. The phone is available now from OnePlus’ website. You can even pick up the limited edition black model… Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge Samsung also launched a pair of impressive Android flagships last year, and despite their age, they’re still some of the best options on the market today. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge offer Quad HD SuperAMOLED displays at 5.1-inches and 5.5-inches respectively. The larger Edge variant also brings dual-curved edges on either side. Under the hood, both devices pack the Snapdragon 820 chipset in the US, and one from Samsung in international regions. The smaller Galaxy S7 packs a 3,000 mAh battery where the S7 Edge brings a 3,600 mAh battery. Both bring fast charging, wireless charging, and fast wireless charging along with the Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, IP68 water resistance, and fingerprint sensors. The 12MP camera on the rear is also nothing short of impressive and the glass/metal bodies scream premium. Pricing varies depending on carrier and outlet, but you can get these phones from pretty much anywhere between $500 and $700 depending on the model. Moto Z/Moto Z Force From Motorola/Lenovo, one, or rather two, of the best options you can pick up come in the form of the Moto Z and the Moto Z Force. Both devices pack 5.5-inch AMOLED displays, the Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and Motorola’s thin software layer on top of Android. The Moto Z brings a 2,600 mAh battery, 13MP camera, and comes in at just 5.2mm thin. The Moto Z Force, on the other hand, brings a 3,500 mAh battery, 21MP rear camera, and is 7mm thin. It also brings a ‘ShatterShield’ display which won’t break. Unfortunately, that model is exclusive to Verizon Wireless. Both devices run on top of Android Nougat, and lack headphone jacks. However, they do include USB-C adapters in the box. That port also includes Turbo Charging which promises up to 15 hours of power with a 15-minute charge. Both are also compatible with Google’s Daydream VR platform. The big story, though, is without a doubt the compatibility with Moto Mods, a method of expanding the phone’s capabilities with modules such as battery packs, speakers, and even a camera. The Moto Z Force is available on Verizon Wireless as is the Moto Z, but the latter is also available unlocked through outlets like Amazon. ZTE Axon 7 If you want a flagship experience, but at a slightly lower price point, the ZTE Axon 7 is an option worth considering. Starting at just $399, the Axon 7 packs a 5.5-inch AMOLED display, all-metal design, front facing speakers, and premium specifications including the top of the line Snapdragon 820 chipset. It also packs an insane 6GB of RAM and support for Google Daydream, all while running on top of Android Nougat. The ZTE Axon 7 is available for purchase from ZTE, Amazon, and many other retailers around the web for $399 unlocked for use on GSM carriers.

Related 10 Tips and Tricks to Get the Most Out of Your New Google Home A Google spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Verge was first to report on the impending update Monday. Google first introduced its Google Home device at its annual Google I/O developer conference last summer. At the time, it hinted at plans to eventually also add multi-user support to allow multiple people to access their individual calendars, get information about their commute and more through the device. The company is expected to give developers and consumers an update on its smart speaker plans at this year’s Google I/O, which is scheduled for mid-May.   Filed Under: Google Google Home Want to read more articles like this one?

Increase / Decrease text size Ellie Burns   - Editor 10th April 2017 Add to favorites Does your business need a chatbot? Chatbots have recently burst onto the tech market with everyone from Google and Apple, to Facebook and Apple, embracing the smart tech. It seems the rush is on to be the next in line to release a chatbot – but is this type of bot right for all businesses? What are the pitfalls and challenges of deploying such a technology. To answer those questions and more, CBR’s Ellie Burns sat down with John Heald, Global VP at SAP Hybris, to talk human to human about this tech trying to muscle in on conversation.   EB: First of all let’s pin down what chatbots actually are – so, what exaclty is a chatbot? John Heald, Global VP, SAP Hybris JH: A chatbot is probably the widest use of “bots” (short for robot) in the market today. Bots are software solutions that operate as an agent for a user, another software program, or simulates a human activity. Chatbots are a specific manifestation of bots and have seen a recent spike in interest due to the rapidly progressing maturity of natural language processing and the ubiquity of mobile devices. The growth of Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant have put chatbots in the limelight, accelerating their acceptance as an appropriate channel. Furthermore, the rise in popularity of messaging platforms such as Slack and WeChat highlight the value of chat-based communication, and not just amongst humans themselves but also between humans and systems. Chatbots have demonstrated their value in dealing with repetitive e-commerce tasks, retrieving team updates and customer service inquiries, all by primarily using messaging as conversational interface.   EB: What are the most appropriate tasks for chatbots? JH: The vast majority of customers currently don’t trust chatbots to run intelligent deductions or understand complex interactions. These perceptions mean that the interaction between customers and chatbots will remain very basic, in the short term, until they are proven to add significant business value. They are typically being used as a consumer facing solution for repetitive, mundane tasks. However, as these automations become more intelligent through machine learning to better resolve customer issues, the use cases will expand beyond the current mundane tasks such as: Can I reset my password? Can I create or update my ticket?   EB: Do you have any real world examples of when a chatbot was used poorly? JH: I had a recent dealing with a telecoms provider and I wanted to look into an issue with my account. I engaged with a chatbot but the result was less than desired as it kept going through the same resolution and spitting out repetitive responses. Simply, if the chatbot isn’t learning from its interactions then it’s a waste of effort and will ultimately create more issues and escalations than it will solve – and potentially be detrimental to customer satisfaction.   EB: What do organisations need to consider when thinking about implementing chatbots? JH: When an organisation decides to introduce a chatbot, it’s advisable to start focused. Task the chatbot with a relatively controlled objective, for example reducing agent wait time by providing a customer with guidance on how to find the serial number of their appliance and not keep the agent on hold. However, just because you’ve deployed a chatbot, the work doesn’t end there. You need to be thinking about what the next steps are and how to constantly improve the service. Think about how the chatbot can take on new challenges and evolve, as that’s when it will deliver real business value. Organisations can’t get complacent, they need to expand to keep pace with the ever-changing demands and expectations of customers and prospects. They will quickly discover that the benefits of deployment are numerous, from providing intelligent service at scale and reducing organisational support costs to delivering a positive experiences for users. John spoke to CBR as part of our on-going Tech Express series. Bots are improving the omnichannel customer journey through a combination of machine learning and intelligence which is underpinning their success. As customers move more fluidly between channels, chatbots will become a key piece of a larger omnichannel strategy.   EB: Which industry is blazing the trail when it comes to chatbot best practice? JH: The industries currently reaping the greatest benefits of chatbots, are those where there are economies of scale, based on the volume of data, namely consumer orientated industries. Currently most use cases are for industries that tend to be at the front end of technology curves, as they have the most to benefit. They also have the scale and repetitive tasks which chatbots can take over. For example, telco network providers (some making better use than others) are using chatbots to inform customers when they’re due for an upgrade or utilities using them to register meter readings, as well as some restaurants using them to help with customer orders.

MobilitySmartphones Back to Home Google wants to make Android smarter with AI algorithms on your phone Increase / Decrease text size Byomakesh Biswal   - Senior Reporter 10th April 2017 Add to favorites Google is currently testing Federated Learning in Gboard on Android, the Google Keyboard. Google is planning to adopt a new approach called collaborative machine learning, or federated learning, to improve the services of smartphones. The new technique called Federated Learning goes beyond the use of local models that make predictions on mobile devices. Under the Federated Learning model, mobile phones will learn collaboratively from a shared prediction model, while keeping all the user-generated data on the device. Google’s new approach will do away with the need of storing data in the cloud to do machine learning. The search-engine giant claims that Federated Learning helps in making the mobile devices much smarter, reducing power consumption, lower latency levels. Presently, Google is testing the machine learning model on its mobile keyboard, Gboard for Android. The Gboard will store information locally on a phone, when a user types-in something and the keyboard returns with a suggestion. Federation Learning will process that history on-device and in the future will suggest improvements to the next iteration of Gboard’s query suggestion model. Google research scientists Brendan McMahan and Daniel Ramage said: “To make Federated Learning possible, we had to overcome many algorithmic and technical challenges. In a typical machine learning system, an optimisation algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) runs on a large dataset partitioned homogeneously across servers in the cloud. “Such highly iterative algorithms require low-latency, high-throughput connections to the training data.

In addition, these devices have significantly higher-latency, lower-throughput connections and are only intermittently available for training.” Google’s research scientists said that the applications of Federated Learning include improvement of language model that power the keyboards, photo ranking based on kind of pictures users look, share and delete.

The Circuit Court ruled in favour of a politician and candidate in the 2014 local elections, Mark Savage, who had made an application to Google to remove a link to a post appearing on Reddit, which in his view described him as homophobic. This was the first instance in which an Irish Court was required to consider the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU') in Google Spain SL & Google Inc v Agencia Espa�ola de Protecci�n de Datos (AEPD) & Mario Costeja Gonz�lez ('Google Spain'). That case established a 'right to be forgotten'. This article looks at the facts and issues in the case. Google Spain revisited In its seminal 2014 judgment in Google Spain, the CJEU found that in certain circumstances, an individual has the right to have information about them removed from the results of an internet search carried out against their name. The right attempts to balance the right to privacy with the right of freedom of expression. It was established through the implicit right of erasure which can found in the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) ('the Directive'). As a brief reminder of the circumstances of the case: Mr Gonz�lez had made an application to Google Spain seeking the removal of certain links to archived newspaper announcements dating from 1998, which related to attachment proceedings for the recovery of social security debts he owed. These search results appeared following a Google search where his name was used as a search term. Mr Gonz�lez argued that as this information was now twelve years old, that it was historic, irrelevant and should be removed by Google. Google refused to remove the link and the Spanish Courts referred the question on the interpretation to be given to certain provisions of the Directive to the CJEU. Article 12 of the Directive provides individuals with certain rights in respect of the processing of their personal data, through a right of erasure. That right permits the 'rectification, erasure or blocking of data, the processing of which does not comply with the provisions of the Directive, in particular because of the incomplete or inaccurate nature of the data.' The CJEU ruled that search engine providers like Google are 'data controllers' within the meaning of the Directive and that it was irrelevant that Google did not exercise control over the personal data published on third party websites. The CJEU determined that the key issue was whether the relevant data could be accessed following a search using the person's name. The Court ruled that search engines must comply with EU data privacy laws and remove data that are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant'. The Court stated that 'the operator of a search engine is liable to affect significantly the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data'. The Court also emphasised that the right to privacy must compete with the right of internet users to have access to information. The potential implications for individuals and search engines were well documented following the decision, and the judgment was considered to have extensive implications for internet search engines. Recent statistics suggest that Google has received 679,566 requests and considered and evaluated 1,878,806 URLs. It has removed 43.3% and refused 56.7%. Following the decision, an Article 29 Working Group was established whose task was to establish (non exhaustive) criteria to be considered when a Data Protection Authority is deciding whether to de-list data held by a data controller. Savage v Data Protection Commissioner The proceedings before the Irish Circuit Court related to Mr Savage's appeal against a decision of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner ('DPC'), who agreed with Google's decision not to delist links responsive to a search using Mr Savage's name. Mr Savage appealed against this decision on the basis that the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 ('DPAs') provide that an individual is entitled to have rectified or, where appropriate, blocked or erased, any data to which there has been a contravention by a data controller. The URL appearing on Reddit.com stated 'Mark Savage North County Dublins Homophobic Candidate' beneath which a public thread discussed the content. The link appeared following a search result when Mr Savage's name was entered into the search engine. Google refused to remove the link on the basis that Mr Savage was a public figure who had been a candidate in the recent local election, and who had engaged publicly in a debate on the issue. Google considered that Mr Savage's views related to his public persona rather than his private life, and refused to remove the link. The decision of the DPC Upon appeal, the Commissioner agreed that Mr Savage was a public figure and also that the data were relevant and accurate. She stated that 'accurate means accurate as to a matter of fact and this link remains accurate in that it represents the opinion expressed of you by a user of the relevant forum.' The Commissioner declined to comment on the quality of the opinion and stated that it was clear that the data reflected an individual personal opinion and not a verified fact. With respect to the URL and discussion forum, the Commissioner noted that Mr Savage had participated in the online discussion and had posted three separate entries. The Commissioner concluded that she was not going to order the removal of the link. The Appeal to the Circuit Court Mr Savage appealed to the Circuit Court and a decision was handed down in October 2016. He had argued that the search result was inaccurate and should be removed, as the URL defined him as a homophobe without any qualification or parenthesis. Mr Savage argued that a user having searched his name on Google would form the view that he had run in the local election as a homophobic candidate. Whilst he agreed that the commentary beneath the URL constituted freedom of expression in the public interest, he stated that the statement should be removed where it was inaccurate and had been asserted without qualification or disclaimer. Mr Savage also stated that the URL would impact on his employment prospects and future plans. In submissions before the Court, the DPC said if the link was inaccurate, out of date, excessive or irrelevant, Mr Savage could have sought its removal as per the decision in Google Spain. However, the key issue of the case turned on the accuracy of the data. Section 2(1) of the DPAs requires that data are kept accurate and the DPC submitted that as the URL 'accurately represented the opinion of the user who posted it', the data were accurate and as such did not require removal. The Commissioner said that due to the nature of online forums, opinions are traded and views shared and therefore 'anything represented on it is unlikely to be qualified as to its factual accuracy but rather represents a perception of a particular online user.' In the Commissioner's view, the online user was 'expressing a personal opinion on the appellant based on election material...rather than making a finding of fact.' Coupled with this was the Commissioner's view that 'any individual user of the internet seeking out facts in relation to any topic is unlikely to consult an online discussion forum such as Reddit as a source of verified facts.' The Circuit Court judgment In considering the submissions made by the parties, the Court cited the criteria of the EU's Article 29 Working Group in assessing whether the data in question were accurate and said that data protection authorities 'will be more likely to consider that delisting of a search result is appropriate where there is inaccuracy as to a matter of fact, and where this presents an inaccurate, inadequate or misleading impression of an individual.' The Court found that the URL was not accurate and 'that if one were to simply consider the URL title, and apply the reasoning of the DPC, it is not accurate by virtue of the fact that it is simply not clear.' The Court reached this decision notwithstanding that 'upon full consideration of the entire thread...it would become clear that the original poster is expressing his or her opinion.' The decision of the Court turned on the interpretation of 'accurate' and how that impacted on the content contained in the URL. The Court's concern was that the interpretation given by the DPC left open 'the possibility of elevating a statement of opinion from the body of any such discussion forum to the status of accurate data, by merely accurately transposing the data from the body of the posting or thread to a URL heading, in the absence of any indication that it is actually requoting such a view.' In the Court's view, the addition of quotation marks or parenthesis would have elevated the title from one of perceived fact to one of opinion. Absent such an amendment, it was not considered to constitute 'accurate data'. It was on this basis that the Court concluded that the DPC had made an error and that the fundamental rights and interests of Mr Savage had been prejudiced. Future of the right to be Forgotten From May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation will put the right to be forgotten on a statutory footing, ensuring that it is no longer a right implicit in the right to erasure. Article 17 of the Regulation states: "The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data". The Regulation sets out prescribed positive obligations on data controllers and large fines for failures to comply with the Regulation. As is the case under Articles 9 and 12 of the existing Directive, the right to be forgotten in the GDPR is not absolute and is subject to certain exemptions or derogations. These include 'the right of freedom of expression and information' (Article 17(3)(a)) and Article 23 which permits Member States to pass laws to restrict certain user rights where it is necessary and proportionate (for example, public security, protection of life and investigation of crime). Conclusions The High Court's appeal of the Circuit Court decision is currently listed for hearing in May 2017. It is understood that Google will be an active participant in the appeal. The determination of these issues by the Irish High Court will be keenly awaited by interested parties in Ireland and beyond. If the finding of the Circuit Court judge is upheld, it is likely to encourage Irish users to exercise � and if necessary seek to vindicate � their right to be forgotten before the Irish High Court.

AI just might provide the key. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Apr 10, 2017 at 10:05AM One of the biggest challenges facing websites, news organizations, and social media is online abuse and harassment. Since the dawn of the internet, sites have battled against abusive, toxic, and inappropriate comments posted in their online forums. With the millions of comments posted, news organization quickly became overwhelmed by the magnitude of data produced. Websites and publishers have become so concerned by the volume of vitriolic comments and fear of lawsuits that many have removed the ability to post comments on their sites. Consider that 72% of internet users in America have witnessed online harassment, and nearly half have experienced it themselves. Social media sites have been under fire to control hate speech and online abuse by their members. Technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) may finally provide the answer. Google uses AI to battle abusive content. Image source: Pixabay.  An important piece of the puzzle Jigsaw, a technology incubator of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), has developed an artificial neural network -- an AI system that replicates the structure and learning capacity of the human brain using algorithms and software models. Using this technology, it aims to identify and control abusive online comments. Google and Jigsaw are making the program available free of charge, and it's being added to the Google's TensorFlow library and Cloud Machine Learning Platform. The product, dubbed Perspective, uses deep learning to sift through reams of data to detect harassment, insults, and abusive speech in online forums in real time. Jigsaw explains how the program works: Perspective scores comments based on the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation, which publishers can use to give real-time feedback to commenters, help moderators sort comments more effectively, or allow readers to more easily find relevant information. We'll be releasing more machine learning models later in the year, but our first model identifies whether a comment could be perceived as "toxic" to a discussion.  Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Google and Jigsaw used comment data from The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT), Wikipedia, and several unnamed partners. They then showed that data to panels of people and had them rate whether the comments were toxic. They used these human responses as training data for the AI system, which will provide ratings of a phrase based on its toxicity on a scale of 100 and allows you to test the system. Type in the phrase "you are ignoring important information" rates a 10%, "your mother wears combat boots" garnered 55%, while "you're a jerk" gets a response of 86% toxicity. The New York Times reports that it only has the resources to allow comments on 10% of its articles. The company provided the archives of comments in hopes of expanding its comments section and to "increase the speed at which comments are reviewed." With only 14 moderators to manually review every comment, the task became overwhelming, reviewing on average 11,000 comments daily. The New York Times joins Google to curb online abuse. Image source: Pixabay. Twitter tries to clean up its act Google is not the only company seeking to curb online bullying using AI. At IBM's (NYSE:IBM) InterConnect conference last month, Twitter, Inc.'s (NYSE:TWTR) vice-president of data strategy Chris Moody announced that the popular social network had partnered with IBM's Watson, the AI-based cognitive computer, to address online abuse. He stated: We're starting just now to partner with the Watson team. Watson is really good at understanding nuances in language and intention. What we want to do is be able to identify abuse patterns early and stop this behavior before it starts. This comes at a crucial time for Twitter, which has been under fire for not policing its users. The company announced last month that it was working to make the site a safer place by limiting abusive users' ability to create new accounts and updating how users can report abusive tweets.  That didn't end well AI systems have been tested on social media before, though the results have been less than stellar. In early 2016, the folks at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) research had used Twitter as a testing ground for an AI-based chatbot, @tayandyou, aka TayTweets, to learn the speech patterns of millennials by interacting with them on the site. Unfortunately, within 24 hours and 96,000 tweets, the experiment was suspended when the fledgling AI began spewing venomous vitriol. Microsoft later said: The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement. As it learns, some of its responses are inappropriate and indicative of the types of interactions some people are having with it. We're making some adjustments to Tay.  Final thoughts Each new technological innovation brings benefits and challenges. The dawn of the internet age brought with it internet trolls, who sought to control the conversation and silence dissenting voices. Programs like Perspective and Watson seek to return voices to those vulnerable speakers, which benefits us all.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News After Reported Federal Finding Of „Extreme” Gender Disparity, Google To Face Shareholder Vote In June BOSTON, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — In 2016, seven of nine top US tech companies bowed to shareholder pressure, disclosing their gender pay gaps and making major progress to improve pay equity.  Alphabet – the parent of search engine Google – was one of the two holdouts to the campaign led by shareholder advocate Arjuna Capital.  New reports that the U.S. Department of Labor has cited the company for engaging in „extreme” and „systemic” gender pay equity disparities makes it clear why the tech giant was a holdout among its peers. But even with its lopsided management control of shares, Google (via its parent Alphabet) can’t escape continued shareholder pressure in 2017. An Arjuna Capital resolution is scheduled to be voted on for the second time when the Alphabet annual meeting takes place on June 7, 2017.  The Alphabet shareholder vote on gender pay disparity will be a challenge since an unusually high percentage of the shares are controlled by the company’s predominantly white male managers and founders. Natasha Lamb, managing director, lead filer of gender pay resolutions, Arjuna Capital, said: „Now we get why Google broke with other top tech companies in 2016 in making major progress on gender pay equity. 2016 was the year in which nearly all of the tech world responded to concerned shareholders by addressing gender disparity issues.  If Google thinks that its massive size and influence somehow makes it invulnerable to shareholder pressure, it needs to think again. Federal litigation, fines, and the risk of resulting civil suits show why shareholders have every right to be concerned.  Investors long-term wealth is under threat when companies flout the rules on how women are treated in the workplace.” Arjuna Capital led the successful shareholder fight last year in getting seven of nine targeted tech companies — eBay, Intel, Apple, Amazon, Expedia, Microsoft and Adobe — to upgrade their standards and transparency on gender pay disparity in the workplace.  Now, Arjuna Capital is taking the same campaign to six top banks and credit card companies:  Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America (in partnership with Baldwin Brothers Inc.), JP Morgan, MasterCard, and American Express.  Arjuna has also refiled their gender pay proposal at Facebook.  Lamb added: „It seems safe to assume that only companies with something to hide are refusing to come clean on gender pay parity.  So, as we turn our focus to big banks in 2017, the logical question is:  Which major US financial institutions are trying to hide the fact that they are the Googles of banking when it comes to gender pay disparity?  Wall Street needs to know what Silicon Valley already knows:  Shareholders expect gender pay disparity at major corporations to become a thing of the past.” Barring major progress in the next few weeks, annual meeting votes on the Arjuna Capital bank-related resolutions will take place in late April at Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America. The other three bank shareholder resolutions and the Facebook resolution are expected to come to votes in May and June. Arjuna Capital worked with co-filers on technology and the bank/credit card company resolutions.  They included:  Alphabet—Baldwin Brothers Inc., Proxy Impact; Facebook—Baldwin Brothers Inc.; Bank of America—Baldwin Brothers (co-lead); JP Morgan—Baldwin Brothers; MasterCard—Baldwin Brothers, Clean Yield Asset Management, Pax World Investments;  and American Express—Clean Yield, Walden Asset Management.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals General Big News For Google As SoundStage Developer Logan Olson Joins Company By Zarmeen Shahzad Apr 7, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Google just got lucky as Logan Olson, who is famous for developing VR music creation tool SoundStage, is joining Clay Bavor’s VR team. This is a huge thing for Google as they have been trying to enter the world of Virtual Reality like so many other companies. The question that comes now is that why Olson’s entry is a huge deal? It’s pretty straightforward really. The tool that Olson developed is not an ordinary music creation tool. Related [UPDATE: Voice Calling Now Rolling Out Globally] Google Duo Gets Voice Call Support While Google Translate Gets ‘Definitions’ Section Advertisement SoundStage, Olson and VR SoundStage allows you to assemble and operate a music studio with the aid of the HTC Vive Headset and wireless controllers. This is all done in the virtual space around you and hence it makes things so much cooler and so much better. According to a Google spokesperson, “We’re excited to welcome Logan to the Google VR team. As a leader in thinking about creating in VR with his app SoundStage, we’re really inspired by what he’s built and for the potential for VR and creativity.” With Olson’s potential and skill there is good chance that Google will be able to bring in some good VR solution or ideas in the future. SoundStage came on Steam last month with a 1.0 release that brought forward various features but also marked the end of the tool’s active development. Olson joining Google shows that SoundStage will now not be able to grow into a Pro or Ableton Live competitor but Google will certainly be at an advantage. Only last fall, Google had announced its Daydream VR platform alongside its Pixel and Pixel XL phones. Since then, there hasn’t been much going on and the company has been quiet when it comes to VR. Daydream compatible devices have been announced since then and the fact that Pixel is not yet very available; it may have limited Daydream’s visibility. Google is hiring Olson and this means that the company is interested in investing towards VR even further.

The legal defense, presented in documents filed in San Francisco federal court, marks Uber’s first detailed response to explosive allegations that its self-driving cars rely on crucial technology designed by Waymo. That company was created from an autonomous-vehicle project started at Google eight years ago. Once a Google ally, Uber emerged as a rival in the self-driving car market in early 2015 when it began developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles. Now, Waymo is trying to thwart that effort by persuading U.S. District Judge William Alsup to block Uber’s self-car driving expansion on the grounds that it hinges on a high-tech heist. The case’s outcome could alter the race to build self-driving cars that may transform transportation, reduce traffic deaths and launch a huge new industry. Waymo filed suit against Uber in February, claiming that a former manager, Anthony Levandowski, stole its patented ideas. After the alleged theft, Levandowski left Google early last year to found a self-driving car startup called Otto that Uber bought for $680 million last August. But Uber is now presenting evidence that it began working on technology dramatically different from Waymo’s more than a year before buying Otto. The dispute centers on a pivotal part of self-driving cars called LiDAR, an array of laser-based sensors that enable self-driving cars to see what’s around them so they can safely navigate roads. In sworn declarations and diagrams, Uber argued that its engineers are working on a more sophisticated form of LiDAR than Waymo’s. Among other things, Uber says its LiDAR uses four lenses for transmitting and receiving laser lights as opposed to the single lens in Waymo’s version. “Waymo could not be more wrong, and Uber’s design could not be more different,” Uber’s lawyers wrote in their rebuttal to the allegations. “And no wonder, Uber’s LiDAR was developed by a different team, using a different beam pattern, and leveraging different know-how.” What’s more, Uber says its custom-designed LiDAR system hasn’t even been installed on the self-driving cars that it has been testing in Pittsburgh, Arizona and San Francisco. Instead, the company says it has been relying on LiDAR systems built by other vendors. Much of the information contained in Friday’s filing was redacted to protect confidential business plans and secret technology. Uber may have its work cut out to sway Alsup, who has said in previous court hearings that Waymo has presented some of the strongest evidence he has seen in his judicial career. A hearing on Waymo’s request for an injunction against Uber is scheduled for May 3. Although Waymo isn’t suing him in this case, Levandowski will play a central role in how the lawsuit unfolds. Levandowski helped establish Google as an early leader in self-driving cars, earning him more than $120 million in incentive pay, according to information inadvertently revealed in court papers earlier this week. Before Levandowski defected from Google early last year start Otto, Waymo alleges he downloaded more than 14,000 documents containing trade secrets that is now helping Uber. After buying Otto, Uber put Levandowski in charge of Uber’s self-driving project, a job that has been imperiled by this lawsuit. Alsup has warned that he may issue an order barring Levandowski from involvement in Uber’s self-driving car division if he sides with Waymo. Uber says it hasn’t found any evidence of ever possessing any of the files that Levandowski stands accused of stealing. Levandowski, meanwhile, has asserted his Fifth Amendment rights to protect himself if criminal charges are filed against him.

Google working on fixing bug with the Links to Your Site report Google Search Console reporting bug leads webmasters to panic over ranking issues. There is no reason to panic -- it is just a reporting glitch and has no impact on rankings. Barry Schwartz on April 10, 2017 at 9:13 am More Google has confirmed they are actively working on a fix for the link report within the Google Search Console. Since Friday, April 7, the tool has been showing “no data available” notifications to those who were checking to see their link data in the tool. This type of reporting bug is not that uncommon, and it has zero influence on your actual search rankings. So just because this report shows no data for your links, it doesn’t mean that Google thinks your site has no links. It’s simply a reporting bug.

Google announces similar items schema for image search on mobile New search feature covers small group of product types now, but Google says it will expand in the coming months. Barry Schwartz on April 10, 2017 at 11:51 am More Google’s image search results on the mobile web and in the Android Search app are now showing “similar items” — i.e., if you’re looking at “lifestyle” images and click on one that you like, Google may show you additional product images from places where you can buy the item(s). Julia E, product manager on Google Image Search, announced on the Google search blog that you need to use schema.org product metadata on your pages and schema.org/Product markup to make sure your products are eligible for inclusion on these image results. Specifically: Ensure that the product offerings on your pages have schema.org product markup, including an image reference. Products with name, image, price & currency, and availability meta-data on their host page are eligible for Similar items. Test your pages with Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool to verify that the product markup is formatted correctly. See your images on image search by issuing the query “site:yourdomain.com.” For results with valid product markup, you may see product information appear once you tap on the images from your site. It can take up to a week for Googlebot to recrawl your website. Here is a screen shot of the results: This schema was actually introduced last December, but Google never announced it. Google says this similar items search feature is available now for “handbags, sunglasses, and shoes and will cover other apparel and home & garden categories in the next few months.” About The Author Barry Schwartz Barry Schwartz is Search Engine Land's News Editor and owns RustyBrick, a NY based web consulting firm.

Weiss EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 The Tensor Processing Unit chips, which were announced in May 2016, run 15 to 30 times faster than contemporary CPUs and GPUs, says Google. Related Media Google Seeks to Refocus on the Cloud with a Machine Learning Platform Using Azure Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance - December 8th Azure Machine Learning for the Enterprise Advertisement Since 2015, Google has been using its own internally-developed Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chips to run machine-learning applications inside its data centers at speeds 15 to 30 times faster than traditional CPUs and GPUs.  Though the company unveiled the existence of the TPU chips back in May of 2016, it only now is revealing more of the technological details of the chips, which were developed by Google to continue and advance the compute-intensive machine learning processes it has been using in its products for more than 15 years. "The need for TPUs really emerged about six years ago, when we started using computationally expensive deep learning models in more and more places throughout our products," Norm Jouppi, a Distinguished Hardware Engineer at Google, wrote in an April 5 post on the Google Cloud Platform Blog. "The computational expense of using these models had us worried. If we considered a scenario where people use Google voice search for just three minutes a day and we ran deep neural nets for our speech recognition system on the processing units we were using, we would have had to double the number of Google data centers." That need led to the creation of TPU chips to help increase compute power without requiring an expansion of data centers, wrote Jouppi.   And speed is what the TPU chips bring to the process, he wrote, with performance 15 to 30 times above the compute power of typical CPUs and GPUs on production artificial intelligence workloads, along with vastly increased energy efficiency. The TPU chips offer 30 to 80 times higher energy efficiency compared with standard chips using the TOPS/Watt measure (tera-operations [trillion or 1012 operations] of computation per Watt of energy consumed), according to Jouppi.  "TPUs allow us to make predictions very quickly, and enable products that respond in fractions of a second," he wrote. "TPUs are behind every search query; they power accurate vision models that underlie products like Google Image Search, Google Photos and the Google Cloud Vision API; they underpin the groundbreaking quality improvements that Google Translate rolled out last year; and they were instrumental in Google DeepMind's victory over Lee Sedol, the first instance of a computer defeating a world champion in the ancient game of Go." Google released its expanded details of its TPU development in a presentation at a National Academy of Engineering meeting at the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley, where it also released a study about the inner workings of the custom TPU chips, wrote Jouppi. More than 70 authors contributed to the report, which details the intricacies, design and thought processes that went into the development of the chips. "It really does take a village to design, verify, implement and deploy the hardware and software of a system like this," he wrote. A TPU is an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that was built specifically for machine learning. It is designed to use the TensorFlow open source software library, which was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization to conduct research on machine learning and deep neural networks, according to Google. TPU chips are tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chips to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation, according to Google. Due to that inherent efficiency, the chips can squeeze more operations per second into the silicon using more sophisticated and powerful machine learning models to get results more rapidly.  Each TPU chip can be installed in a data center rack on a board that fits into a hard disk drive slot.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News After Reported Federal Finding Of “Extreme” Gender Disparity, Google To Face Shareholder Vote In June Lamb: "Now We Know Why Google Broke With Other Top Tech Companies Making Major Progress on Gender Pay Equity"; With Major Shareholder Focus Now on Banks, Question: Which Institutions Are "Googles of Banking" on Gender Disparities? BOSTON, April 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2016, seven of nine top US tech companies bowed to shareholder pressure, disclosing their gender pay gaps and making major progress to improve pay equity.  Alphabet – the parent of search engine Google – was one of the two holdouts to the campaign led by shareholder advocate Arjuna Capital.  New reports that the U.S. Department of Labor has cited the company for engaging in "extreme" and "systemic" gender pay equity disparities makes it clear why the tech giant was a holdout among its peers. But even with its lopsided management control of shares, Google (via its parent Alphabet) can't escape continued shareholder pressure in 2017. An Arjuna Capital resolution is scheduled to be voted on for the second time when the Alphabet annual meeting takes place on June 7, 2017.  The Alphabet shareholder vote on gender pay disparity will be a challenge since an unusually high percentage of the shares are controlled by the company's predominantly white male managers and founders. Natasha Lamb, managing director, lead filer of gender pay resolutions, Arjuna Capital, said: "Now we get why Google broke with other top tech companies in 2016 in making major progress on gender pay equity. 2016 was the year in which nearly all of the tech world responded to concerned shareholders by addressing gender disparity issues.  If Google thinks that its massive size and influence somehow makes it invulnerable to shareholder pressure, it needs to think again. Federal litigation, fines, and the risk of resulting civil suits show why shareholders have every right to be concerned.  Investors long-term wealth is under threat when companies flout the rules on how women are treated in the workplace." Arjuna Capital led the successful shareholder fight last year in getting seven of nine targeted tech companies -- eBay, Intel, Apple, Amazon, Expedia, Microsoft and Adobe -- to upgrade their standards and transparency on gender pay disparity in the workplace.  Now, Arjuna Capital is taking the same campaign to six top banks and credit card companies:  Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America (in partnership with Baldwin Brothers Inc.), JP Morgan, MasterCard, and American Express.  Arjuna has also refiled their gender pay proposal at Facebook.  Lamb added: "It seems safe to assume that only companies with something to hide are refusing to come clean on gender pay parity.  So, as we turn our focus to big banks in 2017, the logical question is:  Which major US financial institutions are trying to hide the fact that they are the Googles of banking when it comes to gender pay disparity?  Wall Street needs to know what Silicon Valley already knows:  Shareholders expect gender pay disparity at major corporations to become a thing of the past." Barring major progress in the next few weeks, annual meeting votes on the Arjuna Capital bank-related resolutions will take place in late April at Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America. The other three bank shareholder resolutions and the Facebook resolution are expected to come to votes in May and June. Arjuna Capital worked with co-filers on technology and the bank/credit card company resolutions.  They included:  Alphabet—Baldwin Brothers Inc., Proxy Impact; Facebook—Baldwin Brothers Inc.; Bank of America—Baldwin Brothers (co-lead); JP Morgan—Baldwin Brothers; MasterCard—Baldwin Brothers, Clean Yield Asset Management, Pax World Investments;  and American Express—Clean Yield, Walden Asset Management. Arjuna Capital is an investment firm focused on sustainable and impact investing.  For more information, visit www.Arjuna-Capital.com.

Home > Google News > Google Maps > Google Tests Showing Number Of Reviews Left By Reviewer Google Tests Showing Number Of Reviews Left By Reviewer Apr 10, 2017 • 8:04 am | (3) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Maps Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Google seems to be testing showing the number of reviews a reviewer has under his or her belt in the reviews snippet for local search results. Here is a screen show showing how the first person listed leaving a review only left one review in their Google review lifetime but the second one, Jennifer, has left 22 reviews in Google Local listings. This screen shot was posted by Joy Hawkins on Twitter. Clearly, Google is trying to convey that not all reviews are equal and that possibly, the review from Jennifer might be more credible than the one from Amy. Although, that is not 100% true and thus, Google just shows you the data and lets you do what you want with it. I think this is a nice touch. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Misc Google > It Seems That I Cause Unnecessary Stress For Googlers It Seems That I Cause Unnecessary Stress For Googlers Apr 10, 2017 • 8:33 am | (36) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Other Google Topics Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story For the past 13+ years I have been causing unnecessary stress for Googlers who work in the search department. I mean, think about it, I hang on every word, tweet, forum post, public message or statement given by these Googlers. I then take what they say, interpret it, and sometimes it goes back to Google PR and causes issues. I try to be accurate in my interpretations and I would NEVER say something that I think is misrepresenting what Google is saying but I am sure there are occasions I do. Since I've been doing this so long, often I joke that I can answer with the Google response better than most new Googlers can. In any event, sometimes I get it wrong or I get it too right that it causes issues. Gary Illyes posted a tweet this morning on Twitter basically, in a joking manner, saying how much I stress out his job. He said "if I'll ever quit this job, you'll be the reason." here is the tweet: @rustybrick @dejanseo If I'll ever quit this job, you'll be the reason 🙄— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) April 10, 2017 If you want the context, it is in response to Dan Petrovic tweeting that I took the bounce rate signal quote out of context and Gary then responds to Dan saying "story of my life..." So of course, I reply, asking if I took it out of context, does that then mean Google does use bounce rate as a ranking signal? That got me the response you see above. Anyway, I hear that this causes stress but my brain works on looking at what people say and sometimes reading too much into it. That is how I have been running this site for over 13 years and hopefully that is how I will run it for the next 13 years. But for some reason, I think Gary doesn't mind it this much. And the truth is, I do have the same overall goals as these Googlers. Try to steer webmasters in the right direction when it comes to search. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Name: Subject: Message: Google testing new way to learn from your data while protecting privacy Newsby Scott Adam Gordon14 hours ago 3 259 10 Google has outlined a new machine learning model which it is testing in an attempt to increase user privacy. The company discussed the new process, which it is calling Federated Learning, in a post on its research blog late last week. Typically, training algorithms requires storing user data on servers (or “the cloud”) to process it. However, this poses a potential security concern, as cloud-based data can be targetted by hackers. With Federated Learning, Google claims that it can achieve this data collection and training on an individual’s device — and the learning can still be shared. This process does mean that some data is transferred to Google’s servers, but it’s essentially an encrypted summary which is mixed with other user data to anonymize it. The original content never leaves a person’s phone. Your phone personalizes the model locally, based on your usage (A). Many users’ updates are aggregated (B) to form a consensus change (C) to the shared model, after which the procedure is repeated. Google says that this Federated Learning is currently being testing with its Gboard keyboard on Android. “When Gboard shows a suggested query, your phone locally stores information about the current context and whether you clicked the suggestion,” wrote Google in the blog post, adding, “Federated Learning processes that history on-device to suggest improvements to the next iteration of Gboard’s query suggestion model.” This means Gboard is learning and applying what are the most relevant suggestions in a given context without the usual data transfer taking place. The benefits, then, are not just related to security, but also to speed — Gboard can apply what has been learned to the app without having to wait for an update to roll out from Google. Crucially, Google also says that this won’t impact device performance: “Careful scheduling ensures training happens only when the device is idle, plugged in, and on a free wireless connection, so there is no impact on the phone’s performance.” See also: Report: Google to invest $880 million in LG to secure OLED panels for Pixel smartphones 23 hours ago If this technology (or similar) could be applied to other apps it would be a huge advance for user privacy. More and more companies are implementing machine learning techniques to increase the effectiveness of their products, and it relies on our data to do so. If these services could be improved while also keeping our data safe, it would benefit everybody. Federated Learning is far more complicated and clever than I’ve made it seem here, so if you want to take a better look at the science behind it, you can head to the Google Research blog now.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT INNOVATION AlphaGo heads to China to challenge best humans yet again by Gordon Hunt 1 hour ago Go. Image: Saran Poroong/Shutterstock Google’s artificial intelligence arm DeepMind took the historic game of Go from humanity’s grasp last year. It plans on underlining its dominance once again in 2017. The power and performance of AI reached new levels in 2016 when, before many people knew it was even possible, a computer program won one of the most complex board games in existence. Over the course of a few weeks and five games, Lee Sedol – champion Go player, rated as one of the best ever in a game stretching back 3,000 years – was taken apart by AlphaGo. Google’s DeepMind AI operation created AlphaGo with the sole aim to master the field and, in beating Sedol, it did so. As if to undermine its status as the best on the planet, AlphaGo is back this year, and the world’s current number one Go player, Ke Jie, is the latest potential lamb to the slaughter. However, Demis Hassabis, co-founder and CEO of DeepMind, maintains that 2017’s battle won’t be another nail in humanity’s Go-playing coffin. Rather, it will help humans to perform even better. “Instead of diminishing the game, as some feared, AI has actually made human players stronger and more creative,” he said. “It’s humbling to see how pros and amateurs alike, who have pored over every detail of AlphaGo’s innovative game play, have actually learned new knowledge and strategies about perhaps the most studied and contemplated game in history.” The Future of Go summit in China, which may have an air of dread around it, will see AlphaGo go up against Jie, as well as a series of other top players across multiple formats of the game, to show just how far along computers have come. One format will see five human players take on AlphaGo together. Another will see humans partner with AlphaGo to beat other humans, also partnered with the computer program. The ancient Chinese game has probably never seen such variety in how it is played. Of course, Go is not the first game to be mastered by AI. Deep Blue finally beat Garry Kasparov, widely thought of as one of the world’s best chess players, in 1997. What added to that drama was that Deep Blue was returning after losing to the same man in 1996. Sadly, a sporting trilogy was never achieved in 1998. Elsewhere, Libratus, an improved AI program based on a previous one called Claudico from 2015, beat four professional poker players at Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold’em. The ‘Brains v Artificial Intelligence’ repeat saw four human players face off against Libratus: Dong Kim, Jimmy Chou, Daniel McAulay and Jason Les. The latter finished 40th in last year’s World Series of Poker main event. They played separate games with Libratus, each logging 120,000 hands against the machine and ultimately losing by a cumulative $1.7m in chips. After four days, the margin was $50,000 but, from there, the algorithm proved its worth and the pros were crushed over three weeks.

Google has patented a bladeless air con that you can look straight through.  The design, which looks similar to Dyson's bladeless fans, could herald a move for affordable air conditioning units to join Google's other smart home devices. Scroll down for video Google has filed a patent that suggests they are working on a new air conditioning unit which is completely unobtrusive and lets in light GOOGLE'S PATENT  The patent features 'evaporator loops' that, when used with a smart thermostat, can help cool a room without using large amounts of electricity.  It also aims to offer a better seal with windows and as it's fanless, is quieter than traditional air-cons and transparent.  For more powerful cooling, the patent says the device features 'Peltier-based cooling' which means it also has a smaller footprint. Traditional air-cons are noisy and can allow hot air to flow back into the home. They can also block some of a window's view, and prevent it from being opened fully. Google's patent, filed this week, aims to solve that.  It has something known as 'evaporator loops' that, when used with a smart thermostat, can help cool a room without using large amounts of electricity. The design doesn't use a refrigerant, according to Fox News. It also aims to offer a better seal with windows and as it's fanless, is quieter than traditional air-cons and transparent.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next How Facebook hacks your brain: Ex-Google product manager...

The Peltier effect is when temperature difference is created by applying voltage between electrodes made from conducting material.  The design might be competition for Dyson's bladeless fans that were launched in 2014. DYSON'S BLADELESS FAN  In 2014, Dyson launched a bladeless fan that is 75 per cent quieter and eliminates the tone that equates to the irritating mosquito hum.   The design includes an innovation called a Helmholtz cavity, which effectively dissipates some of the sound waves caused by the fan. Engineers identified which tone was the most irritating to the human ear, which is equivalent to a mosquito’s beating wind, and managed to kill this. They also smoothed the airflow through the fan, which reduces turbulence further reducing noise. The combined effect of the changes also made the fans some 40 per cent more energy efficient, reducing the running costs.  Dyson spent some £40 million ($50 million) on developing its Air Multiplier bladeless fans. The design smooths the airflow through the fan which reduces turbulence.  This makes the fan around 40 per cent more energy efficient. Traditional air-cons are noisy and can allow hot air to flow back into the home. But Google's new device looks to combat this problem   The Dyson fan ranges in price from £219.99 ($273) to £299.99 ($285) depending on the size and style.  It is unclear when Google's air-con will become available, or how much it will cost.  MailOnline has contacted Google for comment.   Read more: Google air conditioner design could let you see straight through the machine | Fox News Share or comment on this article e-mail 13 shares Most watched News videos Man forcibly removed from plane because flight was overbooked Shocking video shows Colorado cop body slamming sorority girl Second passenger's video of man being ripped off UA flight Dizzy video showcases glass-bottomed swimming pool 40 stories high Doctor who was 'knocked out' on flight is bleeding from the face Shocking footage shows drink driver launching over roundabout Huge ship batters through terrifying heavy winds Video shows Robert Seman from courthouse balcony before trial Poisonous cobra gives unsuspecting man kiss of death on cheek California man films mountain collapse near cars in Malibu Moment suspected suicide bomber appears to attack Egyptian church Motorcyclist breaks speed limit as friend collides with car Airport cop is SUSPENDED over United scandal as new video...

At Next 2017, more than 11,000 customers, partners, developers, and analysts joined Google in San Francisco to learn more about Google Cloud’s latest enterprise updates. We compiled this post following a review of the event with all the Forrester analysts who attended. Here’s our quick assessment from a CIO and CTO perspective: Google Cloud’s enterprise pitch as a public cloud vendor has potential for tech leaders. Google Cloud primarily competes with AWS, Azure, and IBM in the cloud platform segment. Our impression is that Google offers superior technology compared with many other vendors in the enterprise space – but not all. Google has a good IaaS story, but its PaaS capabilities lag behind AWS. Google is not about to dethrone AWS or Azure right now, but it has a good chance to become a powerful competitor to them as it expands globally.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 April 2017 by Military News AI Drives the Rise of Accelerated Computing in Datacenters The recent TPU paper by Google draws a clear conclusion – without accelerated computing, the scale out of AI is simply not practical. Today’s economy runs in the world’s data centers, and data centers are changing dramatically. Not so long ago, they served up web pages, advertising and video content. Now, they recognize voices, detect images in video streams, and connect us with information we need exactly when we need it. Increasingly, those capabilities are enabled by a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning. Deep learning is an algorithm that learns from massive amounts of data to create software that can tackle such challenges as translate languages, diagnose cancer and teach autonomous cars to drive. The change brought about by AI is accelerating at a pace never seen before in our industry. A pioneering researcher of deep learning, Geoffrey Hinton, told The New Yorker recently, “Take any old classification problem where you have a lot of data, and it’s going to be solved by deep learning. There’s going to be thousands of applications of deep learning.” Unreasonably Effective Results Take Google. Its application of groundbreaking work in deep learning has captured the world’s attention: The startling precision of its Google Now service; the landmark victory over the world’s greatest Go player; Google Translate’s ability to operate in 100 different languages. Deep learning has achieved unreasonably effective results. But the approach demands that computers process vast seas of data at precisely the time when Moore’s law is slowing. Deep learning is a new computing model that has required the invention of a new computing architecture. This changing architecture of the AI compute model has occupied NVIDIA for some time. In 2010, Dan Ciresan, a researcher at Professor Juergen Schmidhuber’s Swiss AI Lab, discovered that NVIDIA GPUs can be used to train deep neural networks and achieved a speedup of 50 times over CPUs. A year later, Schmidhuber’s lab used GPUs to develop the first pure deep neural networks that won international contests in handwriting recognition and computer vision.  Then, in 2012, Alex Krizhevsky, then a grad student at the University of Toronto, won the now-famous annual ImageNet large-scale image recognition competition using a pair of GPUs.  (Schmidhuber has chronicled a comprehensive history of the impact of GPU deep learning on modern computer vision.) Optimizing for Deep Learning AI researchers all over the world have discovered that the GPU-accelerated computing model NVIDIA had pioneered for computer graphics and supercomputing applications was ideal for deep learning. Deep learning – like 3D graphics, medical imaging, molecular dynamics, quantum chemistry, and weather simulations – is a linear-algebra algorithm that requires massively parallel computation of tensors, or multi-dimensional vectors. And while NVIDIA’s Kepler-generation GPU, architected in 2009, helped awaken the world to the possibility of using GPU-accelerated computing in deep learning, it was never specifically optimized for that task. We got to work, developing new generations of GPU architecture, first Maxwell, and then Pascal, which included many architecture advances specifically for deep learning. Introduced just four years after the Kepler-based K80, our Pascal-based P40 delivers 26x its deep-learning inferencing performance, far outstripping Moore’s law. During this time, Google designed a custom accelerator chip called the tensor processing unit, or TPU, specifically to handle inferencing, which it deployed in 2015. Its team released technical information about the benefits of TPUs this past week. It asserts, among other things, that the TPU has 13x the inferencing performance of the K80. However, it doesn’t compare the TPU to the current generation Pascal-based P40. Updating Google’s Comparison To update Google’s comparison, we created the chart below to quantify the performance leap from K80 to P40, and to show how the TPU compares to current NVIDIA technology. The P40 balances computational precision and throughput, on-chip memory, and memory bandwidth to achieve unprecedented performance for training, as well as inferencing. For training, P40 has 10x the bandwidth and 12 teraflops of 32-bit floating point performance. For inferencing, P40 has high throughput 8-bit integer and high memory bandwidth. Data based on “In-Datacenter Performance Analysis of a Tensor Processing UnitTM,” Jouppi et al [Jou17], and NVIDIA internal benchmarking. K80 to TPU performance ratios are based on the average of CNN0 and CNN1 acceleration ratios from [Jou17], which compared performance to a half-enabled K80. K80 to P40 performance ratios are based on GoogLeNet, a publicly available CNN model with similar performance properties.While Google and NVIDIA chose different development paths, there were several themes common to both our approaches. Specifically: AI requires accelerated computing. Accelerators provide the significant data processing demands of deep learning in an era when Moore’s law is slowing. Tensor processing is at the core of delivering performance for deep learning training and inference. Tensor processing is a major new workload enterprises must consider when building modern data centers. Accelerating tensor processing can dramatically reduce the cost of building modern data centers. The technology world is in the midst of a historic transformation already being referred to as the AI Revolution. The place where its impact is most obvious today is in the hyperscale data centers of Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Tencent, and others. They need to accelerate AI workloads without having to spend billions of dollars building and powering new data centers with CPU nodes. Without accelerated computing, the scale out of AI is simply not practical. GPU-accelerated computing has enabled deep learning and ignited modern AI. Come to our GPU Technology Conference, on May 8-11, in San Jose, California. You will hear AI pioneers talk about their groundbreaking discoveries, and learn about the latest advances in GPU computing and how they are revolutionizing one industry after another.
