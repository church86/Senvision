Every business, no matter the size or industry, has a website that usually includes webpages listing the key products and services it's trying to sell. Most also have other pages devoted to targeted content the organization needs surfaced more prominently in Google's search results than its competitors. That's what the "optimization" part of SEO is looking to accomplish, and it's a nitty-gritty game of keyword and research-driven leapfrog, made significantly more complicated by Google changing all the rules every few months. That's where SEO tools come in. The emphasis on tools, meaning plural, is important. There's no one magical way to plop your website atop every single search results page, at least not organically. If you want to buy a paid search ad spot, Google AdWords will happily take your money. But to win for the more valuable and customer-trusted organic search spots, a balanced and comprehensive SEO strategy is a must-have. This can be broken down into three primary categories: ad hoc keyword research, ongoing search position monitoring, and crawling. In this roundup, we'll explain what each of those categories means for your business, the types of platforms and tools you can use to cover all of your SEO bases, and what to look for when investing in those tools. Breaking Down the SEO Tool Landscape The first wave of our roundup covers five top, self-service SEO tools: Ahrefs, KWFinder.com, Moz Pro, SEMrush, and SpyFu. The primary function of these tools falls primarily under keyword-focused SEO. When deciding what search topics to target and how best to focus your SEO efforts, treating keyword querying like an investigative tool is where you'll likely get the best results. These cloud-based, self-service tools have plenty of other unique optimization features as well. Some also do search position monitoring while others have more interactive data visualizations or crawling capabilities. The more powerful platforms can sport deeper analytics on paid advertising and pay-per-click (PPC) SEO as well. Though, at their core, the tools are all rooted in their ability to perform on-demand keyword queries. We concentrated on the keyword-based aspect of these SEO tools because that's where most business users will primarily focus. Monitoring particular keywords and your existing URL positions in search rankings is important, but once you've set that up it's largely an automated process. Automated position-monitoring features are a given in most SEO platforms and will alert you to issues, but they don't actively improve your search position. When your business has an idea about a new search topic for which you think your content has the potential to rank highly, the ability to spin up a query and investigate right away is key. Even more importantly, the tool should give you enough data points, guidance, and recommendations to confirm whether that particular keyword, or a related keyword or search phrase, is an SEO battle worth fighting, and, if so, how to win. We'll get into the factors and metrics to help you make those decisions a little further down. Click infographic for full view. Copyright: Third Door Media. Written by Search Engine Land, Design by Column Five Crawlers are largely a separate product category. There is some overlap with the self-service keyword tools (Ahrefs, for instance, does both), but crawling is another important piece of the puzzle we'll explore in greater depth with the second wave of reviews in this roundup. There are two types of crawling, both of which provide useful data. Internet-wide crawlers are for large-scale link indexing. It's a complicated and often expensive process but, as with social listening, the goal is ultimately for SEO experts, business analysts, and entrepreneurs to map how websites link to one another and extrapolate larger SEO trends and growth opportunities. Crawling tools generally do this with automated bots continuously scanning the web. As is the case with most of these SEO tools, many businesses use internal reporting features in tandem with integrated business intelligence (BI) tools to identify even deeper data insights. Website-specific crawlers, or software that crawls one particular website at a time, are great for analyzing your own website's SEO strengths and weaknesses and arguably even more useful for scoping out the competition. Website crawlers analyze a website's URL, link structure, images, CSS scripting, and associated apps and third-party services to evaluate SEO. Not unlike how a website monitoring tool scans for a webpage's overall "health," website crawlers can identify factors such as broken links and errors, website lag, and content or metadata with low keyword density and SEO value while mapping a website's architecture. Website crawlers can help your business improve website user experience (UX) while identifying key areas of improvement to help pages rank better. The last piece of the complicated SEO tool ecosystem is the enterprise tier. This roundup is geared toward SEO at the small to midsize businesses (SMBs) level for which these platforms are likely priced out of reach. But the handful of enterprise SEO software providers out there essentially roll all of the self-service tools into one comprehensive platform that combines ongoing position monitoring, deep keyword research, and crawling with customizable reports and analytics. The enterprise platforms can also tie in larger content marketing campaigns and return-on-investment (ROI) metrics for integrated digital marketing teams. We may look at enterprise-tier SEO platforms in future reviews but, for SMBs, a smart combination of self-service tools is the much better bang for your SEO buck. Running the Numbers Evaluating which self-service SEO tools are best suited to your business incorporates a number of factors, features, and SEO metrics. Ultimately, though, when we talk about "optimizing," it all comes down to how easy the tool makes it to get, understand, and take action on the SEO data you need. Particularly when it comes to ad hoc keyword investigation, it's about the ease with which you can zero in on the ground where you can make the most progress. In business terms, that means making sure you're targeting the most opportune and effective keywords available in your industry or space—the words for which your customers are searching. The terms SEO experts often start with are page authority (PA) and domain authority (DA). DA, a concept in fact coined by Moz, is a 100-point scale that predicts how well a website will rank on search engines. PA is the modern umbrella term for what started as Google's original PageRank algorithm, developed by co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google still uses PageRank internally but has gradually stopped supporting the increasingly irrelevant metric, which it now rarely updates. PA is the custom metric each SEO vendor now calculates independently to gauge and rate (again, on a scale of 100) the link structure and authoritative strength of an individual page on any given domain. That's why PA and DA metrics often vary from tool to tool. Each ad hoc keyword tool we tested came up with slightly different numbers based on what they're pulling from Google and other sources, and how they're doing the calculating. The shortcoming of PA and DA is that, even though they give you a sense of how authoritative a page might be in the eyes of Google, they don't tell you how easy or difficult it will be to position it for a particular keyword. This difficulty is why a third, newer metric is beginning to emerge among the self-service SEO players: difficulty scores. Difficulty scores are the SEO market's answer to the patchwork state of all the data out there. All five tools we tested stood out because they do offer some version of a difficulty metric,or one holistic 1-100 score of how difficult it would be for your page to rank organically (without paying Google) on a particular keyword. Difficulty scores are inherently subjective and each tool calculates it uniquely. In general, it incorporates PA, DA, and other factors, including search volume on the keyword, how heavily paid search ads are influencing the results, and how the strong the competition is in each spot on the current search results page. It's exceedingly easy as an SEO team to spin your wheels trying to optimize a term into which your business will never be able to break. Difficulty scores quantify that potential opportunity versus risk proposition into one number, which is why we spent a lot of time in this roundup testing how effectively each tool represented keyword difficulty. For example, let's say the keyword difficulty of a particular term is in the 80s and 90s in the top five spots on a particular search results page. Then, in positions 6-9, the difficulty scores drop down into the 50s and 60s. Using that difficulty score, a business can begin targeting that range of spots and running competitive analysis on the pages to see who your website could knock out of their spot. It All Comes Back to Google The caveat in all of this is that, in one way or another, most of the data and the rules governing what ranks and what doesn't (often on a week-to-week basis) comes from Google. If you know where to find and how to use the free and freemium tools Google provides under the surface—AdWords, Google Analytics, and Google Search Console (formerly Webmaster Tools) being the big three— you can do all of this manually. Much of the data the ongoing position monitoring, keyword research, and crawler tools provide is extracted in one form or another from Google itself. Doing it yourself is a disjointed, meticulous process, but you can piece together all the SEO data you need to come up with an optimization strategy should you be so inclined. As Google tweaks its algorithms, tools, and search engine policies, so goes the SEO industry. The AdWords API is still the foundation of much of the data with which SEO tools work. Google used to make much of its ad-hoc keyword search functionality available as well, but now the Keyword Planner is behind a pay-wall in AdWords as a premium feature. Difficulty scores are inspired by the way Google calculates its Competition Score metric in AdWords, though most vendors calculate difficulty using PA and DA numbers correlated with search engine positions, without AdWords data blended in at all. Search Volume is a different matter, and is almost always directly lifted from AdWords. Not to mention keyword suggestions and related keywords data, which in many tools come from Google's Suggest API. Platforms also made use of the unofficial Autocomplete API before Google shut it down last year. An SEO expert could probably use a combination of AdWords for the initial data, Google Search Console for website monitoring, and Google Analytics for internal website data. Then transform and analyze it using all a BI tool. The problem for most business users is that's simply not an effective use of time and resources. These tools exist to take the manual data gathering and granular, piecemeal detective work out of SEO. It's about making a process that's core to modern business success more easily accessible to someone who isn't an SEO consultant or expert. Where the free Google tools can provide complementary value is in fact-checking. If you're checking out more than one of these SEO tools, you'll quickly realize this isn't an exact science. If you were to look at the PA, DA, and keyword difficulty scores across KWFinder, Moz, SpyFu, SEMrush, and Ahrefs for the same set of keywords, you might get different numbers across each metric separated by anywhere from a few points to dozens. If your business is unsure about an optimization campaign on a particular keyword, you can cross-check with data straight from a free AdWords account and Search Console. Another trick: enable Incognito mode in your browser along with an extension like the free Moz Toolbar and you can run case-by-case searches on specific keywords to get an organic look at your target search results page. The SEO tools in this roundup provide tremendous digital marketing value for businesses, but it's important not to forget that we're living in Google's world under Google's constantly evolving rules. Oh and don't forget to check the tracking data on Bing now and again, either. Google's the king, but the latest ComScore numbers have Bing market share sitting at 22.1 percent. How To Choose Your SEO Tool Suite When it comes to finally choosing the SEO tools that suit your organization's needs, the decision comes back to that concept of gaining tangible ground. It's about discerning which tools provide the most effective combination of keyword-driven SEO investigation capabilities, and then on top of that the added keyword organization, analysis, recommendations, and other useful functionality to take action on the SEO insights you uncover. If a product is telling you what optimizations need to be made to your website, does it then provide technology to help you make those improvements? The self-service SEO tools we tested all handle pricing relatively similarly, pricing by month with discounts for annual billing with most SMB-focused plans ranging in the $50-$200 per month range. Depending on how your business plans to use the tools, the way particular products delineate pricing might make more sense. KWFinder.com is the cheapest of the bunch but it's focused squarely on ad-hoc keyword and Google search results page (SERP) queries, which is why the product sets quotas for keyword lookups per 24 hours at different tiers. Moz and Ahrefs price by campaigns or projects, meaning the number of websites you're tracking in the dashboard. Most of the tools also cap the number of keyword reports you can run per day. SpyFu prices a bit differently, providing unlimited data access and results but capping the number of sales leads and domain contacts. For the purposes of our testing, we standardized keyword queries across the five tools. To test the primary ad-hoc keyword search capability with each tool, we ran queries on an identical set of keywords. From there we tested not only the kinds of data and metrics the tool gave, but how it handled keyword management and organization, and what kind of optimization recommendations and suggestions the tool provided. Enterprise SEO platforms put all of this together—high-volume keyword monitoring with premium features like landing page alignments and optimization recommendations, plus on-demand crawling and ongoing position monitoring—but they're priced by custom quote. While the top-tier platforms give you features like in-depth keyword expansion and list management, and bells and whistles like SEO recommendations in the form of automated to-do lists, SMBs can't afford to drop thousands of dollars per month. The tools we tested in this round of reviews were judged on which do the best job of giving you the research-driven investigation tools to identify SEO opportunities ripe for growth, along with offering enterprise-grade functionality at a reasonable price. Whether one of these optimization tools is an ideal fit for your business, or you end up combining more than one for a potent SEO tool suite, this roundup will help you decide what makes the most sense for you. There's a wealth of data out there to give your business an edge and boost pages higher and higher in key search results. Make sure you've got the right SEO tools in place to seize the opportunities.

Oct 28, 3:32 PM EDT Correction: Twitter-In Need Of Change story NEW YORK (AP) -- In a story Oct. 27 about changes awaiting Twitter users, The Associated Press misidentified the Twitter user who made comparisons to YouTube. The remarks came from Brant Moeller, CEO of a Brooklyn-based creative agency, rather than New York attorney Danny Mann. A corrected version of the story is below: More changes await Twitter users as service tries to grow Twitter users are bound to see changes as the beleaguered communications service tries to broaden its appeal to more people and advertisers By BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Twitter users are bound to see changes as the beleaguered service favored by journalists, celebrities, politicians and cranks tries to broaden its appeal and attract advertisers. That's whether it gets a new owner or not. On Thursday, Twitter announced one immediate change: It's shutting down its once-pioneering video-sharing app Vine, which has been eclipsed by the likes of Snapchat and Instagram. What else might be in the works? For now, think tons of small tweaks rather than a 180-degree turn. In a conference call discussing the San Francisco-company's quarterly earnings, an analyst asked CEO Jack Dorsey if there were any plans for big, revolutionary product changes. "We've been making hundreds of small changes as quickly as we can," Dorsey's responded, adding that users are showing that the "changes are working." For now, it's looking like Twitter will stay an independent company, despite months of rumors to the contrary. But a new owner could still swoop in, and depending on who it is, could clean up Twitter and curb some of the nastiness that's become synonymous with it. Or perhaps a new owner would just show more ads. Or let it languish while it mines the best of what Twitter now has into its existing products and services. All of this is speculation, of course, and there might not even be a new owner. Twitter's stock has plunged after rumored bidders are, well, rumored to be no longer interested. On Thursday, the company announced that it would cut 9 percent of its workforce globally as its revenue growth slowed. While its adjusted earnings beat Wall Street expectations, it reported a loss of almost $103 million before one-time charges and costs are removed. A new parent - whether that's Google (huh?), Salesforce (who?) or Disney (hmm...) - could inject fresh life into a 10-year-old company that's never turned a profit and remains confounding to many people. Of course, none of these potential suitors have acknowledged interest in Twitter, let alone their plans for it. Even if Twitter stays independent, drastic changes to its service might just be what Twitter needs to be competitive with Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. How might it change? --- TWITTER BECOMES MORE LIKE ITS NEW OWNER, IF THERE IS ONE Facebook's absorption of Instagram and WhatsApp in recent years could offer clues. Both services have kept separate identities, to an extent, and have experienced user growth. But slowly, they are acquiring Facebook-like features. For example, Instagram no longer presents feeds chronologically; they are now sorted much like Facebook's news feed, using some secret formula known only to Facebook. Though the change has turned off some early Instagram users, its user base has soared, to 500 million as of June. That's nearly 200 million more than Twitter, even though Instagram is three years younger. As Instagram gets more users and a mainstream appeal, its content has diluted somewhat. But many of the street photographers, graffiti artists and tween mini-celebrities who made Instagram what it is are still there - maybe just harder to find. --- STAYS THE SAME BUT WITH MORE ADS Twitter has never turned a profit, and whoever buys it will need to fix this. That means boosting the user base, so advertisers would follow. That also could mean better targeting, so that ad rates go up. Google, anyone? The search giant is the leader in online ads. Imagine what its might and muscle could do to Twitter's ad business. YouTube hardly had any ads when Google bought it; now, ads are so prevalent that YouTube is able to charge $10 a month for an ad-free version called Red. Instagram has also inserted ads into users' feeds of perfectly composed snapshots featuring everything from cappuccino foam to seafoam. It started out slowly with a carefully curated ad here and there, but today you're not likely to avoid ads when opening the app. --- A TOOL FOR BRANDS, NOT REVOLUTION Jonathan Cowperthwait, a Twitter user since 2008, said he'd be worried if Google bought Twitter because the online search giant "is the worst" at social services that aim to foster online interactions, beyond email. Its Google Plus service never took off; Orkut and Dodgeball closed. Cowperthwait said that rather than let Twitter live independently, Google might "try to shoehorn it back into their own social product." Salesforce, a company that provides internet services to businesses, has also been mentioned as a contender, leading to a lot of head-scratching among users. Would Twitter become a business product, used for customer service and marketing instead of revolutions, neo-Nazi memes and political outbursts? "Salesforce is a very technology-driven company," eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson said. "It seems they would want (Twitter) mostly for the data that Twitter has." --- THE LITTLE BIRD FALLS OUT OF THE NEST Remember MySpace? It was - the - social network before Facebook came along. News Corp., the stodgy media conglomerate, bought it for $580 million in 2005. But users started falling off as MySpace failed to keep up with Facebook's speedy innovations. After layoffs and failed relaunches, News Corp. sold the fallen giant for $35 million in 2011, and that was just about the end of it. It's not unthinkable that Twitter could suffer the same fate under a big media company. --- SILENCE! Walt Disney's reputation as a squeaky-clean, family-friendly company is perhaps the clearest antithesis to Twitter's soul, as many users see it - even though Disney is much bigger than Mickey Mouse and owns ABC, Marvel and the "Star Wars" franchise, among other properties. "My chief fear is that Disney will wield Twitter as one large PR machine to prop up their image and squash dissent," said Timothy Hayes, an Ohio State University student who says he fell in love with Twitter in high school. "The Mouse is not above silencing (its) opponents." Some users, on the other hand, might welcome some thorough housecleaning that goes beyond the steps Twitter is currently taking to curb abuse and nasty behavior on its service. Brant Moeller, a Twitter user who runs a Brooklyn-based creative agency, says that while Google has improved YouTube "in ways that were unimaginable at the time," he finds many of his fellow YouTube users difficult to deal with. In this sense, it's possible that even with Google's weight behind it, the abusive and nasty nature of many Twitter comments would remain as is. © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They are working on everything from driverless cars to simple software security solutions in order to make things more exciting and easier for consumers. Their latest innovation comes from the Android Experiments convention, which is an online “celebration of the creative, ingenious, and surprising things developers are making with Android.” Google engineers decided that since they had been receiving so many new and unique inventions, they would create something as well. Thus, Google’s Sprayscape was born. This is a gyroscopic camera that takes pictures on the inside of a 360-degree sphere. The resulting picture is a kind of VR experience that requires a simple point and tap. There’s also an element of personal creativity to the mix. It has the functionality to let you spray faces, places, or anything else onto a canvas to create a collage of photos and creativity. Regarding the process of using Sprayscape for VR pleasure, Google offers the following description: “Sprayscape is a quick hack using the phone’s gyroscope to take pictures on the inside of a 360-degree sphere. Just point your phone and tap the screen to spray faces, places, or anything else onto your canvas. Like what you’ve captured? You can easily share your creations via a link in a text message or on social media with friends. They can jump into your scapes and have a look around using their phones or even Google Cardboard for a more immersive experience.” It all starts when you download Sprayscape from Google Play for free. Then, you can begin taking photographs and linking with your friends immediately. The reviews so far have been average at best. On Google Play, it has a 3.2 rating with more than 500 views. Here are some of the reviews: “As advertised, but still wtf. It does what it says, but I’m really lost on the purpose of this. The results are just plain ugly and pretty useless. I know this isn’t meant to be photosphere, but I just see no use for whatever this is.” – 3 stars, Richard Craig “Relax. Stop freaking out and comparing this to Photospheres because they even say it’s imperfect and messy and is meant to be a fun and creative toy. I do think though this has the right idea, if perfected, to be a great way to capture Photospheres without the tedious stitching and whatnot.” – 5 stars, Shawn Westphal All in all, users think it’s a fun app to play with, but it’s missing some key features that would make it truly useful.

Boosts Buybacks After Another Great Quarter With a strong ad business and promising progress in "Other Bets," the internet search giant is repurchasing (exactly) $7,019,340,976.83 in shares. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Oct 28, 2016 at 6:42PM IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced stronger-than-expected third-quarter 2016 results Thursday after the market close, marking its fourth report since shifting to a segment-based reporting model earlier this year. With Alphabet stock up 1% as of this writing after briefly touching a fresh all-time high, it's apparent the market is happy with what it had to say.  Let's take a closer look at how Alphabet kicked off the second half of the year. The headline numbers Consolidated quarterly revenue increased 20.2% year over year, to $22.45 billion, and would have increased 23% if it weren't for the effects of continued foreign-currency pressure. Based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), consolidated operating income grew 22.5% year over year, to $5.77 billion, and net income rose 27.2%, to $5.06 billion. GAAP net income per share also increased 26.5%, to $7.25, for each of Alphabet's class A and B common shares and class C capital stock. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation, operating income grew 24.2% year over year, to $7.63 billion, and net income rose 24%, to $6.33 billion. Adjusted net income per share grew 23.3% year over year, to $9.06. Keeping in mind that last quarter, Alphabet completed all share repurchases under its previous repurchase authorization, its board of directors also authorized a new repurchase program of up to $7,019,340,976.83 shares. As an aside, Alphabet could have made its latest repurchase authorization an even $7 billion, but it would have sacrificed an opportunity to make another very Google-esque joke. Astute math geeks quickly figured out that 7019.34097683 is equivalent to 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) to the power of "e," an important mathematical constant. And this replaces Google's previous authorization, which allowed repurchases of up to $5,099,019,513.59 -- which is the square root of 26 multiplied by $1 billion. Getting back to the headline numbers, Google doesn't provide specific quarterly financial guidance. So for perspective -- and while we don't typically pay close attention to Wall Street's expectations -- analysts had predicted Google would report lower revenue of $18 billion and adjusted earnings of only $8.64 per share. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat called it a "great third quarter" adding, "Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we're excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets." Breaking it down Alphabet once again offered color on its two primary operating segments, including Google and Other Bets.   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Growth (YOY) Google segment revenues $18.534 billion $22.254 billion 20.1% Google operating income $5.807 billion $6.778 billion 16.7% Other Bets revenues $141 million $197 million 39.7% Other Bets operating income (loss) ($980 million) ($865 million) N/A DATA SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. On Other Bets During the subsequent conference call, Porat was quick to offer the caveat that, "[W]e think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer-term horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy [...]." After all, as I pointed out in my earnings preview earlier this week, the Other Bets segment consists primarily of early-stage, pre-revenue businesses that operate in a variety of different industries. The majority of Other Bets' $197 million in revenue -- an increase of nearly 40% over the same year-ago period -- was generated as per usual by Nest (connected home products), Fiber (high-speed internet), and Verily (longevity solutions). And the segment remains consistently unprofitable, generating an operating loss this quarter of $865 million. To Alphabet's credit, Other Bets' operating loss, excluding stock-based compensation (SBC), would have been "just" $665 million. And even accounting for SBC, this quarter's loss narrowed significantly from $980 million in the same year-ago period, even as capital expenditures dedicated to the segment rose 19.6% year over year, to $324 million, mostly reflecting continuing investments in the Fiber business. Finally, Other Bets' capital expenditures remain a small fraction of the $2.43 billion the company dedicated to its core Google business.  Speaking of which... As a reminder, Google's segment businesses include Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play, and Gmail, as well as Ads, Commerce, Apps, Cloud, and hardware products. But as expected, the main driver of revenue for most of Google's segments remains advertising. Thankfully, that core revenue source continued to enjoy robust growth. Advertising revenue at Google increased 18.1% year over year, to $19.82 billion, representing 88.3% of Alphabet's total revenue, and down slightly from just over 89% last quarter. Within that, advertising revenue from Google's own websites grew 22.9%, to $16.09 billion, and ad revenue from Google Network Members' sites rose 1%, to $3.732 billion. During the call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated that Google's advertising business is "thriving in a mobile world," thanks largely to its simple, resonating value proposition to marketers as enabled by Google's suite of vastly popular mobile properties from Search to YouTube, Maps, and Google Play.  "They are using our services because they want to actively watch something they are passionate about, or because they want to know, go, do, or buy something," added Pichai. "It's just like people used to be glued to their TV screen during prime time -- our services are prime time for the mobile world." Growth in aggregate paid clicks accelerated to 33% year over year this quarter -- up from 29% last quarter -- including 42% growth in paid clicks on Google websites, and a 1% increase in paid clicks on Google Network Members' sites. On the other hand, aggregate cost-per-click -- which helps quantify how much Google makes per ad -- declined 11% year over year, including a 13% drop on Google sites, and a 14% decline on Google Network Members' sites. This includes a rapid increase in YouTube's TrueView impressions, which tend to reach consumers earlier in the purchase funnel, so generally monetize at lower rates than traditional web-based ads. Even so, Google is working to make this up in volume. In addition to YouTube's inherent growth, the company recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase online awareness of their brands. And early tests indicate that YouTube generates nearly twice as many Google and YouTube searches for their brands than comparable TV impressions. Last but not least, we can't forget revenue from Google's non-advertising sources. Thanks to strong performances from both Google Play and Cloud, "Other" Google revenue grew 38.8% year over year, to $2.43 billion. There were no big positive or negative surprises in this report. It's important, however, that the company's core ad business stays healthy, and that it continues to methodically invest in promising complementary growth opportunities. More than anything, this represents the latest in a string of strong reports from Alphabet. All things considered, it's no surprise to see shares hovering near all-time highs right now.

The slogan: “Ghostriding for the masses.” More About: The Changing Automotive Landscape George Hotz at Tech Disrupt Day 2016.  Getty Images Advertisement Self-driving cars are getting closer by the day, but they won’t be coming from hacking phenomenon George Hotz. Hotz, the first person to jailbreak an iPhone and a vagabond of the world’s top tech companies, has scrapped his self-driving project after receiving a stern letter from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Hotz said via Twitter that he would be exploring other products and other markets. “I would much rather spend my life building amazing tech than dealing with regulators and lawyers,” he wrote. “It isn’t worth it.” While Google, Uber, and a crowd of automakers pour billions of dollars into self-driving technology, Hotz took the Best Buy route, cobbling his system together with cheap, off-the-shelf cameras and GPS units paired with artificial intelligence software that “learns” en route. He had been at it about a year. When Businessweek went on a ride along in December, Hotz’s white Acura had a joystick where a gear shift knob would be and a 21.5-inch Dell computer screen mounted vertically on the center console. He said his prototype cost about $20,000, roughly what Google pays its interns over the course of a summer. “Don’t touch any buttons, or we’ll die,” he said at the time. Popular Now Tesla’s Future in Trump’s World Five Rules for Selecting the Best KPIs to Drive Operational Improvement The Changing Face of Direct Materials Over time, Hotz, who has worked briefly at Google, SpaceX, and Facebook, essentially trained the system as if it were a 15-year-old, driving manually for hours while the computers recorded what he was doing. Over time, it got better and better. His plan was to sell the system, dubbed “Comma One,” as an after-market kit for $999. The slogan: “Ghostriding for the masses.” comma ai @comma_ai the comma one: comes in any color you want as long as it's neon green https://t.co/RG66S6j5ja Twitter: comma ai on Twitter The NHTSA letter, penned Oct. 27 by the agency's top attorney, reminded Hotz that his venture would be considered a manufacturer of motor vehicle equipment and, as such, is subject to federal oversight. “As you are undoubtedly aware, there is a high likelihood that some drivers will use your product in a manner that exceeds its intended purpose,” it read. comma ai @comma_ai Got this in the mail today. https://t.co/BsEANVWoXn First time I hear from them and they open with threats. No attempt at a dialog. -GH 1/3 Twitter: comma ai on Twitter   Among other things, the agency asked for a copy of Comma One installation steps, user instructions, and a description of what might happen if the system were put in a car that doesn’t support it. If Hotz didn’t respond by Nov. 10, he risked penalties of up to $20,000 a day. “Mr. Hotz’s decision to cancel the product is his own,” NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas said in an e-mail. Hotz didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The magic and wonder of self-driving dreams have taken a dark turn in recent months. In May, an Ohio man was killed when his 2015 Tesla drove itself under the trailer of an 18-wheeler in Florida. The white side of the rig didn’t stand out against the bright sky, according to the automaker. A few weeks later, NHTSA released data showing the largest increase in U.S. traffic fatalities in almost five decades. While some have said the grisly metrics makes a case for fast-tracking robot cars, others argue that automated driving systems are exacerbating accidents by inciting driver distraction. Regulators, traditionally laissez fare about self-driving technology, jumped into action and opened a probe into the fatal Tesla accident. Meanwhile, the Transportation Department unveiled in mid-September a set of 15 rules outlining how driverless cars should be tested and programmed. In recent weeks, Apple and Alphabet’s Google have vastly scaled back their auto ambitions. Meanwhile, Hotz has been dialing back the promise of his creation. In an Oct. 20 blog post he warned the system “will not turn your car into an autonomous vehicle.” Hotz says it is essentially a much better version of features like lane-keep assistance and adaptive cruise control, which are increasingly common on contemporary vehicles. It’s hard to imagine that there aren’t a number of other code jockeys out there running systems similar to Hotz’s, perhaps they aren’t as well known or facile with publicity. As long as there have been cars, grassroots engineers have hacked them. They used to do it with wrenches and duct tape; now they turn to processing chips and lines of code. NHTSA won’t find them all, though the Hotzs of the world are beginning to bump up against similar technology coming out of Detroit. The giants of the auto industry have been investing heavily in hackers of their own and fine-tuning automated systems. “The old conversation I used to have was, ‘You guys are going to end up being the handset, you’re going to be low-margin assemblers of other people’s cool technology,’” Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford told Bloomberg last week. “We don’t want to be the handset. And we won’t be.” As for Hotz, it appears that today’s news will cost him a bet against Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Hotz had promised that he would best Mobileeye, the driver-assist package that went into Teslas. “Frankly, I think you should just work at Tesla,” Musk wrote to Hotz in an e-mail. Perhaps, the offer is still good. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 4 RichandNotFamous on Oct 31, 2016 There's something missing from the article, the NHTSA doesn't say answers to technical questions are required. The request/demand letter requires you to acknowledge the you received the request. It's kind of like the form for jury duty. The letter simply gives you notice that answers to the questions will be required before approval for larger, more advanced test regimes. There may be more questions, but you are definitely going to have to answer those in the letter. You get the same letter, different questions, for pretty much anything that's new and ultimately intended for use on public roads. We went through it with the old "car phones" that were actually installed in the car. GM got the same letter when they decided to do away with mechanical throttle cables in favor of fly-by-wire throttle controls in some models. Unknown to almost everyone, OEM HID headlights got the same pre-test study guide, but the DoD and DoE were involved as well and sent their own letters. For better or worse, if you are serious about shaking up established industries as anything more than a speed bump then government regulators and lawyers are part of the deal. I'm not sure if you can even find an industry more infested with lawyers than the auto industry. I find it hard to believe the Hotz fellow didn't know that going in. In fact, if he's maintaining a dialogue with Elon Musk there's no way he didn't know the red tape and the associated costs wouldn't be astronomical. Companies with near unlimited funds and technical resources, like Google and Apple, have publicly acknowledged they underestimated the costs and technical hurdles on the road to autonomous cars (ha!). I wager that's the case with the Hotz guy as well, but he doesn't have the funds to continue throwing it at the project. Admitting you don't want to go completely broke in a one man battle against enormous companies isn't admitting defeat. It's being smart and it doesn't sound nearly as arrogant and commercially sanctimonious.

I get technology like blind spot and back up sensing, lane drift and emergency braking, but again as more and more technology is introduced, it makes drivers less involved and more likely to be distracted and complacent. I have been around the auto industry nearly my whole life, and I can not recall ever hearing anyone say they wished they owned a car that drove itself Log In or Register to post comments jjusko on Oct 31, 2016 What about the elderly who no longer can drive?

Google, Facebook, 2K score with NBA interns 0 Share: Tech Culture by Terry Collins October 28, 2016 2:14 PM PDT @terryscollins Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech It's no stretch to say Hollis Thompson knows how to hustle. The Philadelphia 76ers swingman -- he plays both shooting guard and small forward -- regularly shows his mettle in the fast break or transition, or with a clutch shot. This summer, the NBA helped the fourth-year Georgetown product take his skill set to a new arena: business. For two weeks, Thompson interned at 2K, the video game company that makes the popular NBA2K and Mafia III titles, pitching big retailers Target and Walmart at the E3 gaming conference in Los Angeles. "It was pretty exciting and more hands-on than I could've even imagined," Thompson said in an interview. "Besides playing basketball, this was one of the best experiences of my life." Thompson isn't the only baller looking beyond the NBA, whose regular season tipped off on Tuesday and heads into its first full slate of weekend games. Twelve other players joined the league's Career Crossover, an unpaid job-shadowing program that matches players with companies in different industries to spark interest in "second career" possibilities. The NBA leverages its corporate partnerships -- companies love to associate themselves with pro sports -- to secure opportunities for players. Greg Taylor, the league's senior vice president of player development, says increasingly that's meant tapping tech behemoths, such as search giant Google and social network Facebook, because the tech industry is cropping up more often in post-career conversations with players. Philadelphia 76ers' swingman Hollis Thompson, as he appears inn the NBA2K 17 video game. Thompson interned at game maker 2K this summer.

"The main purpose of this program is exposing the players to multiple career options and letting them see what skills they need to develop in order to be competitive in this other world," Taylor said. Technology companies were popular destinations because "this generation of players lives and breathes with technology and their smartphones." The NBA players union is also stirring interest in post-basketball career possibilities. In July, the union held its inaugural tech summit in San Francisco to connect players with Silicon Valley companies. The three-day event was led by Golden State Warriors swingman Andre Iguodala, a renowned tech investor and a vice president for the union. Fans see headlines about millions of guaranteed dollars and wonder why any ex-player would need to take a job. They read about all-time greats, like Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, and imagine all players will be as successful off-court as they are on. Basketball doesn't last forever The reality, says Michael Goldman, a sports management professor at the University of San Francisco, is usually different. "I'm far more concerned for the lesser known, midlevel players who are living a high life," Goldman said. "Then suddenly it all stops, possibly due to injuries or declined play, and they're struggling with what to do next." That's why Thompson and peers like Hollins, a journeyman center still looking for a contract in what will be his 10th season, all volunteered to take part in the NBA program. For some, like Watson, a 12-year veteran who's in the second of a three-year, $15 million contract with the Orlando Magic, the end of a career is within sight. At Facebook, Hollins and Aminu, a forward for the Portland Trail Blazers, spent time with the company's sports partnership division, which handles the Facebook's relationships with sports leagues and sports media outlets, as well as product and marketing specialists.

Hollins and Aminu were asked for their opinions of the Oculus Rift, a virtual-reality headset a Facebook subsidiary makes, as well as Facebook Mentions, Instagram and Facebook Live. Hollins said the experience was too short -- just two days -- but well worthwhile. If a second career in the broadcast booth doesn't pan out, he says, he's going to pursue tech. NBA players Ryan Hollins, left, and Al-Farouq Aminu pose in front of an Instagram logo while spending time at Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters as part of the league's Career Crossover program. "There's a real push to have internet access everywhere. How do we get this to Africa, Haiti and India?" Hollins said of Facebook. "That's commendable." The social network, which has hosted NBA players on its campus for three summers, calls it a "mutual learning benefit." "We're just as excited to hear what they have to say," a Facebook spokesperson said. "Their feedback on our products and insights into their social media behavior are invaluable for our teams." At Google, the NBA players sat in with teams that build the search firm's varied products, which range from its core business to email to storage. They sat in with the YouTube business, which is working to monetize its popularity. Watson, a point guard on the Orlando Magic, told me he was enthralled with Google's program on self-driving cars, which had a fun but intense atmosphere. "They sort of want to be the cool kids," Watson said. "They do a lot of things outside the box, which I respect." A Google spokesperson said the partnership was valuable to Google because it valued the NBA's culture of collaboration, strategic foresight and leadership under pressure. "In fact, we use the term 'general athlete' when we describe who we're looking to hire," the spokesperson said. "People with highly transferable skill sets who can hit the ground running when they get here." Video gamesmanship 2K had even more ambitious plans for Thompson, an avid gamer, and wasted no time putting him to work, says Alfie Brody, a marketing vice president. After time spending a week at E3 in Los Angeles, Thompson, 25, headed back to 2K's headquarters in Marin County, California, pitching in with the development teams on the popular NBA2K game, widely praised as one of the best sports video games on the market. Thompson also worked alongside engineers, designers and artists for the franchise. His responsibilities: providing them with feedback on the players he's faced, to help the game capture that real feel. He also weighed in on his own player rating -- 72 -- which he thought was too low (LeBron James of the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers has a 96 rating, and reigning NBA MVP Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors has a 94). Thompson offered his opinion on other aspects of the game, too, particularly the MyTeam and Franchise modes, where users can create their own NBA franchise, with its own look and team name. The baritone-voiced Thompson said 2K took his feedback to heart. "I think I was surprised by the amount of people involved and the work that goes into making a game," he said. "It's a much bigger operation than I thought." 2K was impressed, Brody said, and Thompson has an open invitation to return next summer. "Hollis knows things right down to the smallest detail," 2K's Brody said. "He provided a ton of insight into the life of an NBA player." Thinking about his future, Thompson, who just had his $1.5 million team option contract picked up by the Sixers this season, said he's game with 2K. "Yes," he said, "I'm definitely coming back."

Alphabet was formed last year, in part, to insulate the lucrative online advertising business of its Google division from riskier, more capital-intensive projects now called Other Bets. The strategy was on display in the company’s third-quarter results, released on Thursday. The technology giant culled investment in Other Bets and doubled down on Google’s cloud and artificial-intelligence initiatives.  Those investments will only accelerate next year, executives told analysts during a conference call that followed a strong third-quarter report, driven largely by growth in Google’s main digital ad business. The shares rose 1.1 percent to $825.98 at 9:44 a.m. in New York Friday. Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said the cloud business is building a team focused on machine learning, an important branch of AI, and is hiring aggressively. "As we head into 2017," he said on the earnings call, "I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and growth." Cloud Growth Google is racing against Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other big technology companies to provide AI-powered services over the internet from remote data centers. The combination of these technologies may produce powerful and lucrative new products for consumers and business customers. Google doesn’t disclose the performance of its cloud business. But its "other revenue" line, which includes this unit along with the Google app store and hardware sales, saw revenue grow 39 percent to $2.4 billion in the third quarter. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the cloud division is "generating substantial revenue growth." Cloud chief Diane Greene has helped win new corporate customers for its data-processing, analysis and storage services this year. Google is still behind market leader Amazon.com Inc. which posted a 55 percent gain in cloud revenue on Thursday, reaching $3.2 billion for the third quarter. However, Google executives’ rhetoric suggests Alphabet is plowing money into businesses capable of generating strong returns, and cutting investment from projects with more questionable financial potential. Porat also cautioned investors that marketing spending will rise in the fourth quarter to promote new Google hardware like its Pixel smartphones. Pichai and Porat have told investors before that Alphabet’s biggest bets are inside Google. Pichai oversees most of the company’s AI and virtual reality efforts, along with its costly data centers. Yet shout-outs for the cloud business came amid a pullback from Alphabet’s Other Bets, particularly its Google Fiber internet service and Nest connected-device subsidiary. Other Bets Trimmed The Other Bets segment, which also includes the autonomous vehicle project and two biotech research initiatives, lost $865 million in the third quarter, narrowing from a $980 million loss a year ago. Growth in capital expenditures on these businesses also slowed down from the prior two quarters. Porat stressed that Other Best are on a "longer time horizon," but also said Alphabet is resetting some of them as they strive to find business models. Earlier in the week, the Fiber internet service announced a retreat from eight major proposed markets as well as jobs cuts and the loss of its top executive. That followed a string of high-level departures from Other Bets companies. "News that Fiber has been ‘paused’ should be welcomed by investors concerned over rising CapEx," Daniel Salmon, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to investors. Porat said Fiber had made "important breakthroughs" in wireless technology, but is re-evaluating expansion plans. "We wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we re-accelerate deployment," she said. Pichai shrugged off the executive exits. He also dismissed concern about other notable departures from Alphabet, including a team of veteran engineers from its self-driving car project, who were recently acquired by Uber, and Niantic Labs, the company behind the viral mobile game Pokemon Go. "We generally want to create a culture of innovation, and that’s what we focus on and it is fine that some of them happen outside," he said. The CEO also noted "world-class products" from Alphabet that serve over one billion users. All of them come from Google. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Now under the Alphabet umbrella, Google is becoming a brand - for online services yes, but also for hardware. Leading the charge are the Pixels, Google's equivalent to Samsung's Galaxy or Apple's i-gadgets... and every bit as premium. True, the Pixel name debuted with a Chromebook, later adopted for an Android tablet, but it will definitely be remembered for the phones. This must be the company's biggest marketing push for a Google-branded hardware product. It's not just that, Google even put a promo for Allo on the most valuable real estate on the web - Google.com. Allo, if you haven't heard, is the new messaging client (paired with video chat app Duo) and is at the heart of the Pixel phones. The AI assistant available in Allo is more prominently featured in the Pixels and you can talk with it, not just text. Then there's Google Photos, Google Drive and so on. This perfectly mirrors Apple's strategy of iMessage, iCloud, etc. Software is Google's forte, but the company is new to hardware. With both Apple and Samsung flexing supply chain muscle, will the hardware of the Google Pixel XL live up to the pricing that exactly matches the iPhone 7 Plus (and tops the Galaxy S7 edge)? Let's see. Google Pixel XL key features: Aerospace-grade aluminum unibody (glass window on the back); splash and dust resistant (IP53) 5.5" AMOLED screen of QHD resolution, 534ppi, 100% NTSC; 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 Quad-core Kryo processor, Adreno 530 GPU, 4GB of RAM, Snapdragon 821 chipset Google-loaded Android 7.1 Nougat; 2 years of OS upgrades from launch, 3 years of security updates 12.3MP camera, f/2.0 lens, 1.55µm pixels, Phase and Laser AF, dual-LED, dual-tone flash; 2160p and 1080p @ 30/60/120fps video capture 8MP selfie camera, f/2.4 lens, 1.4µm pixels; 1080p video capture Comes with 32GB or 128GB of built-in storage, no expansion Fingerprint reader, Android Pay LTE Cat 9 or 11 (450Mbps or 600Mbps downlink, 50/75Mbps uplink); Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 (A2DP, LE), GPS + GLONASS, NFC 3,450mAh battery; Fast charging over USB Type-C Main disadvantages: Most expensive Google phone yet No stereo speakers No water resistance No OIS for the camera No wireless charging, no IR port or FM radio Snapdragon 821 chipset is downclocked to 820 speed Standard Nexus cons: no microSD slot, sealed battery Design is arguably bland We openly admit to being a little salty. Don't get us wrong, we haven't been spoiled by the likes of Xiaomi, OnePlus, ZTE and others. Hell, you can buy TWO Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus phones for the price of one Pixel XL, that one has a Snapdragon 821 too, not to mention dual cameras and no weird glass windows on the back. What we're pouting about is that the Pixel XL isn't clearly better than the Nexus 6P it is supposed to replace and it didn't bring back any of the features that the 6P dropped from the Nexus 6 spec sheet. Not a good time to be cutting features, especially when Apple has everything short of an Always on screen (which the Pixels also lack) - dual cameras, water resistance, the best mobile chipset, truly awesome screen, even stereo speakers! Apple was in the opposite situation compared to Google - it was known for its hardware, its software was laughed at (remember Apple Maps at launch?). But now iMessage is one of the best respected messengers, iCloud is reliable and cheap, even Maps has improved massively. Can Google walk the same path in the other direction - from beloved software (Search, Maps, Android) and an overpriced Chromebook Pixel to the world's best smartphone? We have a ticket to the preview show and it's called the Google Pixel XL - shh, the trailers are starting!

Many practitioners have a safer option if they work for a healthcare system that uses a mobile app like Citrix Receiver. That provides a secure tunnel that lets clinicians send information from a smartphone, tablet, or laptop to an electronic health record system located elsewhere. But not everyone has access to Citrix applications. In smaller practices with limited finances, other options to consider are a standalone virtual private network (VPN)1, an encrypted cellular service, and Google's Business Associate Agreement (BAA) -- covering Gmail, Drive, and Docs. A VPN will encrypt data as it is sent across a Wi-Fi connection, but setting up one of these networks can be quite complicated for someone without advanced training in information technology. A much less painful option is using a commercially available VPN vendor. PCWorld and Lifehacker both offer recommendations on viable candidates. Linking one's smartphone to a laptop is another way to make the transmission of protected health information (PHI) more secure, assuming the smartphone is encrypted. For example, on Apple's iPhone, it is possible to set up a personal hotspot that tethers a laptop or tablet to the phone's wireless Internet service. Of course, it is also important to encrypt the phone itself with a passcode and to update its operating system regularly. Google has also set up several of its apps to make transmitting PHI more secure on the Internet. The company offers a subset of core services that are HIPAA-compliant, including Gmail, Google Drive (which in turn includes Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms), Google Calendar, Google Sites, and Google Apps Vault. Users are required to sign a BAA with Google and follow a set of requirements spelled out by the company on its website. The HIPAA-compliant versions of these apps are only available through Google's "Apps for Work" subscription service, which involves a nominal fee. In the future we'll go into the details of Google's HIPAA offerings for smaller medical practices.

The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc's Google, which crashed Apple Inc's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google's Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft Corp's Cortana. "We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information," Rakowski said in an interview.   LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button." The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words "OK Google." By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google "doesn't have to do negotiations with another handset maker - they can make it as tight as they want," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. "If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator," said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. "They will be relegated to just pushing hardware." Google is coy about its plans. "Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible," Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company's earnings call on Thursday. "The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience," he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie," he said. "I approach this the same way."

REUTERS/Beck DiefenbachMore By Julia Love (Reuters) - About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc's Google, which crashed Apple Inc's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google’s Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Corp’s Cortana. “We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information,” Rakowski said in an interview.  LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button.” The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words “OK Google.” By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google “doesn’t have to do negotiations with another handset maker – they can make it as tight as they want,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. “If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. “They will be relegated to just pushing hardware.” Google is coy about its plans. “Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible,” Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Read More Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. “The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience,” he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it’s not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie,” he said. “I approach this the same way.” (Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Bill Rigby) Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Donald Trump is already proving he has no idea what he is in for Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Online freedom hit by pressure on social media, apps AFP New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

By Jack Wallen | October 28, 2016, 1:33 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen Google Drive power users, you can get quite a bit of mileage out of having quick access shortcuts to various folders on your Google Drive account. With certain homescreen launchers, you could easily create shortcuts to various locations; however, with some newer launchers (especially the Google Now Launcher), that ability has vanished. So, what do you do? Fortunately, Google had the foresight to include this feature in the latest releases of the Google Drive Android app. The feature isn't exactly obvious, but once you know how it's done, you'll be shaking your head at how easy it is to add these shortcuts to your homescreen. When you use the feature, you'll find it's a quick way to access your work folders while on the go—no more navigating through Google Drive's folder hierarchy. SEE: Mobile Device Computing Policy (Tech Pro Research) Adding those shortcuts More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter Believe it or not, the feature is hiding in plain sight. Here's what you have to do. Open the Google Drive app. Navigate to the parent directory housing the folder in question. Long press the folder you for which you want to create the shortcut. In the resulting popup toolbar, tap the three vertical dots (Figure A). Tap Add To Home Screen. Figure A Image: Jack Wallen Creating a home screen shortcut on a OnePlus 3. Creating a folder of shortcuts You don't want a homescreen crammed full of Google Drive shortcuts. To avoid such clutter, tap and drag one of the shortcuts onto another to create a folder. Once you've done that, you can drag all of your Drive shortcuts into that folder and then tap the name of the folder to give it an appropriate name (Figure B). Figure B Image: Jack Wallen You now have instant access to those folders you access on a regular basis. You can always create multiple homescreen folders...each with a specific department, client, data center, etc. This way you have quick access to those Drive folders you use the most...without getting confused or cluttering up your homescreen.

Look hard enough and you’ll spot references to Jaws, The Goonies, The Karate Kid, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Twin Peaks, and dozens more flicks from one of sci-fi’s golden eras, nostalgia that evidently struck a cord. An estimated 14 million people watched the series in its first 35 days of availability, number that were apparently music to Google’s opportunistic ears. On Friday, the search giant announced a partnership with Netflix that will see Stranger Things’ most iconic scenes and characters appear in Allo, Google’s voice messaging app. Allo, for the unaware, is akin to messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, and the like. You sign up with a mobile phone number, and your conversations are synced locally to your phone. You’re mostly limited to messaging other Allo users, but an SMS relay lets you invite others to download and install the app. Related: Despite mixed reviews, Google Allo has more than a million downloads in three days Stranger Things is premiering on Allo in the form of a sticker pack that will no doubt ring a bell for any devotee of the show from the Duffer Brothers. There’s a graphic “Lando” cap, a sketched-out homemade slingshot, an animated seven-sided board game die, an impressionistic cathode ray tube TV, and more. All are a free download from within Allo’s sticker storefront, and appear alongside other images and GIFs in the messaging interface when installed. And for Allo users who happen to live in New York City, there’s more: an AI-powered scavenger hunt. Type “Where is Barb” — a reference to a Stranger Things character’s untimely end — and you’ll receive directions to a location in the city’s SoHo district. From there, Allo will map the way to a “mind-control vending machine” that will drop a “suggestion chip.” That chip, when tapped, will divulge the location on one of several ’80s-era Halloween treats: a sticker, a BMX bike, a Panasonic boombox, a Pentax camera, and more. Related: Hands-on: Google Allo It’s not the first Stranger Things collaboration between Google and Netflix, believe it or not. The two tech giants worked together to craft a terrifying virtual reality experience for Google Cardboard, Google’s handset-powered VR hardware. The Stranger Things tie-in is just one fresh coat of paint Allo’s gotten in recent days. A major update added a monochrome theme, a landscape orientation, direct messages, and the ability to reply to messages directly from notifications on iOS and Android. On iOS, you can now scribble on photos before you send them to friends. And on smartphones running Android 7.1 Nougat, Allo gained compatibility with the operating system’s split-screen mode — you can, for example, carry on a conversation in one window while watching clips from Stranger Things in another. Finally, it now plugs into the operating system’s new GIF keyboard tool and launcher shortcuts — you can search for animated clips to send a friend while you’re chatting, or quickly start a new conversation from the Allo shortcut on your home screen. Allo may not be the blockbuster for Google in the same way that Stranger Things was for Netflix, but it has done well enough for itself. The nascent messaging platform managed to rack up more than a million downloads in three days, growth likely attributable to tight integration with Google’s intriguing eponymous intelligence, the Google Assistant. It’s an artificially intelligent bot that performs Google searches, plays games, sets alarms and reminders, and even suggests contextually appropriate replies to messages. Related: “Stranger Things” Season 2 is confirmed! Here’s everything we know Allo’s launch hasn’t been without its rough patches. After Google backtracked on a decision not to store Allo communications, privacy advocates including Edward Snowden protested, arguing that the service, which doesn’t encrypt most messages, would be subject to surveillance by law enforcement. (Allo offers secure messaging in Incognito Chats, involving secure messaging channels between a variable number of users, but it isn’t enabled by default.)

Google parent Alphabet's better-than-expected third-quarter results show that while the company continues to rely heavily on advertising dollars, some of its other businesses—most notably its cloud unit—have begun contributing meaningfully to the top line. Revenue from Google's cloud business and the sale of digital content via its Play store accounted for $2.4 billion, or more than 10 percent of the $22.3 billion in revenues that the Google segment under Alphabet made last quarter. That number represented increases of 39 percent from the same period last year and 12 percent sequentially. During the earnings call on Oct.28, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat pointed to the revenue growth as a sign that Google's investments in different businesses is beginning to pay off. "Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business as well as the enormous opportunity in this area," Porat said. During the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai touted "strong customer engagement" for the company's cloud business. He pointed to Google's setting up a separate cloud unit, its investments in machine learning, and the growing portfolio of products and services in this category as evidence of Google's commitment to deliver new capabilities for its cloud customers. Over the next year, Google will add eight new cloud regions, including Mumbai, Singapore, Sao Paulo and Frankfurt, he said. "As we officially move into the Google Cloud era, our goal remains the same," Pichai said. "We want to build the most open cloud for all businesses and make it easy for them to build and run great software." For the most part though, Google's revenues continue to be heavily ad-dependent. About $16.1 billion of the $22.3 billion Google generated in revenues last quarter came from ads placed on Google websites, including Search, YouTube, Maps and Finance. Third-quarter revenue was 23 percent higher on a year-over-year basis and 4 percent higher than second-quarter revenues. As it has for the past few quarters, ads displayed in mobile search results contributed significantly to the increased revenues from Google websites. Some of the growth also came from YouTube ads—which, according to Porat and Pichai, continue to be a high-performing area for Google. Revenues from ads on Google network member websites, including those sold via its AdSense, DoubleClick and AdMob, grew a modest 1 percent year-over-year to $3.1 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet's "Other Bets," the name the company uses for its collection of disparate business ventures, such as Nest, Fiber and Verily, continued to swim in red ink, though somewhat slightly less so than last year.  Combined, Alphabet's Other Bets accounted for an $840 million operating loss on revenues of $197 million, compared with a $980 million operating loss on $141 million revenues in the same period last year. Porat urged investors to look beyond the short term for the Other Bets. "Quarterly revenues can be lumpy for three primary reasons," Porat said referring to the performance of the Other Bets segment. "First, the Other Bets are early-stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And finally, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals," she said. Google chalked up third-quarter net income of $6.3 billion, representing earnings per share of $9.06. The company held in excess of $83 billion in cash and securities at the end of the quarter.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   How the Internet Came of Age as a Campaign Tool in 2016 Election Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards YouTube Now Providing Support for High-Definition Video Cloud Native Computing Foundation Adds New Project, Grows Membership Microsoft Adds Kubernetes for Azure Cloud Container Orchestration                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Oct 28th 2016, 9:45 PM 25,572 Views 24 Comments Share64 Tweet Email Jennifer Lawrence (left) and Kate Upton Source: PA AN AMERICAN MAN has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hacking the accounts of Hollywood stars, which led to the online release of private nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and other celebrities. Ryan Collins, 36, was sentenced in a US District Court in Pennsylvania for a felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The computer hacking charges were related to illegally accessing “over 100 Apple and Google email accounts, including those belonging to members of the entertainment industry in Los Angeles”, the US Justice Department said. The “Celebgate” hack led to the online publication in 2014 of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities including Rihanna, Avril Lavigne and Gabrielle Union. The statement did not refer to the victims by name, but several of the victims spoke publicly about the pictures. In May, Collins entered a guilty plea in connection with the hack, and admitted to a “phishing” scheme to obtain passwords, in order to then get nude pictures from the victims’ cloud online storage accounts. No evidence However, officials said there was no evidence that Collins published the pictures online. “Hackers violate federal law whenever they access private information stored online and in digital devices,” said Eileen Decker, US attorney for the central district of California. Decker said that her office will hold hackers accountable “even when they do not sell or distribute the stolen data”. By gaining illegal access to the email accounts, “Collins accessed at least 50 iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts, many of which belonged to female celebrities”. Collins would sometimes also download the entire contents of the victims’ Apple iCloud backups. Collins also “ran a modelling scam in which he tricked his victims into sending him nude photographs”. In September, Edward Majerczyk agreed under a deal with federal authorities to plead guilty to one felony count of unauthorised access to a protected computer in the same “Celebgate” case. © – AFP, 2016 Read: The FBI is re-opening the investigation into the Hillary Clinton email saga Read: Fighter jets escort plane to Scottish airport after communications fail Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-10-28 Print               Pixel phones are exclusively offered through Verizon or Google, but T-Mobile is offering buyers monthly rebates to switch their service. Google's popular new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones may be available exclusively through Verizon and Google, but that's not stopping T-Mobile from offering rebates to get buyers to move their new phones over to the Un-Carrier's network. T-Mobile is now offering any Google Pixel or Pixel XL buyer a $325 rebate—equal to half the cost of a 32GB Pixel smartphone—in equal bill credits over 24 months to switch their mobile service on their Pixel or Pixel XL handset to T-Mobile from Verizon. T-Mobile announced the offer on Oct. 27. The offer is available to new and existing T-Mobile customers for first-time owners of a Pixel or Pixel XL phone who moves to T-Mobile's One mobile plans. Pixel phones are sold as unlocked handsets. "If you think you can only purchase and use the Pixel on Verizon… that's simply not true," the company said in its announcement. "Don't let the 'exclusive' advertisements fool you, the Pixel phone is tested and proven to be fantastic on our lightning-fast network, and we want to help you get the best of both worlds," John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile, said in a statement. "I'm a huge fan of what Google has done with the Pixel, and now consumers can use it the way it should be used—with truly unlimited data on the fastest 4G LTE network in America." The monthly offer is good for any 32GB or 128GB Pixel or Pixel XL handset and gives customers an automatic $13.55 bill credit each month for 24 months, totaling $325, or half the price of a basic Pixel 32GB phone. The deal can be obtained by buying any Pixel phone and presenting proof of purchase through T-Mobile's online validation site, according to the carrier. The offer is good within 30 days of the receipt of a Pixel handset and will still be honored if shipping delays occur with the phones due to tight supplies at present, said T-Mobile. The rebates will be offered as long as a customer's Pixel phone has been ordered during the eligibility period, according to the terms of the offer. One monthly Pixel rebate is offered for each phone, and the deal is available for up to eight lines per customer. Since going on sale Oct. 20, Google's Pixel and Pixel XL Android smartphones are so popular that several versions are completely out of stock and others are apparently taking longer to get to buyers than Google previously estimated. All 5.5-inch Pixel XL handsets in Quite Black or Very Silver are out of stock in both 32GB and 128GB configurations, while the 5-inch Pixel models in certain configurations—32GB in Very Silver and 128GB models in Very Silver and Quite Black—are shipping in two to three weeks, according to the Google Store's ordering page. Other standard Pixel models are completely out of stock, including the Pixel 32GB Quite Black version and the 32GB Really Blue Limited Edition version. In an email reply to an Oct. 27 eWEEK inquiry, a Google spokesperson said the company is "working to restock our inventory as soon as possible." The 32GB 5-inch Pixel phones sell for $629, while the 128GB Pixel sells for $749. The larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL handsets sell for $769 for the 32GB models and for $869 for the 128GB versions. The Pixel handsets, which Google has designed and engineered, are sold only through the Google Store and Verizon, including Verizon mini-stores inside selected Best Buy stores. The standard Pixel phone has a 5-inch full HD AMOLED display, which is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 4, has a 2,770mAh battery, and is 5.6 inches tall, 2.7 inches wide and 0.3 inches thick. Its larger stablemate, the Pixel XL, has a 5.5-inch quad HD AMOLED display, a Corning Gorilla Glass 4 cover and a 3,450mAh battery, and is 6 inches long, 2.9 inches wide and 0.34 inches thick. The phones are the first Google devices to include the latest Google Assistant services built-in to assist consumers in their everyday lives. Both phone models feature a metal unibody design with curved edges, a Snapdragon 821 MSM8996 quad-core processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 memory, a 12.3-megapixel auto-focus, rear main camera with an f/2.0 lens and an 8MP front-facing, fixed-focus camera with an f/2.4 lens. The two handsets can capture and play 4K video as well as 1080p and 720p video. Both models also include a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor for device and user security, fast charging that can provide up to seven hours of use from a 15-minute charge, a USB Type-C port, a 3.5mm headset jack, a single SIM receptacle and a single bottom-firing speaker. Also included is 24/7 technical support for the handsets through a preloaded app that gives tech support personnel the ability to examine the phone remotely after the owner consents to the assistance. In addition, both handsets include Google's new Android Nougat operating system with automatic updates in the background and free unlimited storage of photos and videos at original quality and full resolution through Google Photos. The handsets come in Quite Black or Very Silver in 32GB or 128GB versions, but only in a 32GB version in the other color choice, Really Blue.             LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul NXP Unveils New Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles Google Moves to Mobile-First Indexing for Search                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

IBM employees on an assembly line for the Ramac, the first computer with a hard drive, on August 29, 1959, in San Jose, California. [Photo: Getty Images/Bettmann/Contributor] Harry McCracken 10.28.16 4:00 PM Next week, IBM is formally opening Watson West—a San Francisco outpost for its Watson "cognitive technology" platform, which the company is training to help everyone from doctors to merchants make smarter decisions. Occupying three floors of a gleaming office building in San Francisco’s startup-heavy South of Market neighborhood, the office includes both space for employees involved in the Watson effort and a slick demo center where IBM can whip up enthusiasm among third-party developers, prospective customers, and other outsiders. Watson West is, in part, a statement about IBM’s desire to embed itself in the San Francisco Bay Area tech community. But it’s also less of a striking departure than the latest chapter in a long story. IBM may be the archetypal big East Coast tech company, but it's understood the benefits of being at home in the Bay Area for decades, dating back to the era when it was a manufacturer of automation equipment, and the computer was still in the process of being invented. Watson West IBM long ago shifted its emphasis from big iron to software and services. With Watson, it's a key player in the race to use machine-learning technology to train computers to understand big data in an array of fields—an industry trend that, in one way or another, has also swept up everybody from Google to Facebook to Microsoft to Apple. "IBM has a lead on this, having started a couple of decades ago," says Watson General Manager David Kenny, who is still a newcomer to IBM, having joined the company when it closed its acquisition of his former employer, the Weather Company, in January. Computer scientists at the IBM Research-Almaden lab in San Jose were part of the AI research that made Watson possible in the first place and are helping to chart its future. Now, with Watson West, the company has a presence "at the top of the [San Francisco] peninsula as well as the bottom," Kenny says. That's particularly important as Watson becomes the foundation for capabilities that can be commercially deployed in specific business sectors—a process that frequently involves startups who build on top of IBM's work. "Many of those companies are on the West Coast and funded by VCs on the West Coast," says Kenny. David Kenny Helping such companies work with IBM with as little friction as possible is key to Watson fulfilling its potential. "People can always travel, and people will travel for the most important relationships," says Slack cofounder Stewart Butterfield, whose startup announced this week that it was partnering with IBM to let third-party developers build Slack chatbots powered by Watson intelligence. What you lose with distance is the ability to participate in forms of collaboration and community such as hackathons without giving it a second thought. "You can fly out over and over again for that kind of stuff, or you can be in the Bay Area and catch the action," Butterfield says. (In the case of the IBM-Slack collaboration, Slack happens to have search and intelligence staffers based in New York, which let them commute by foot to Watson headquarters in the city's Astor Place neighborhood, eight blocks away. But some meetings—including ones involving Butterfield—took place in San Francisco.) In The Beginning When IBM first put down roots in Silicon Valley in 1943, the area was known for its bounteous orchards, not technology. The company bought a 34,000-square-foot factory in San Jose and began manufacturing punch cards for its tabulating machines. (The computer industry didn’t exist yet, though IBM was at work on research that helped create it.) "Our decision to establish a plant on the Pacific coast is based not only on the large amount of business that we now have in the territory, but on our belief that after the war, the Pacific coast will be a far greater industrial district than ever before," explained legendary CEO Thomas J. Watson Sr. It would take decades before it was clear just how prescient he was. In 1952, the company added to its San Jose presence with a lab based in the city’s downtown area. Four years later, one of the industry’s landmark achievements happened there when a small team of researchers invented the hard drive, which the company used as part of an accounting computer called the 305 RAMAC. The 305 RAMAC, a 1950s room-sized IBM computer, was designed and built in San Jose.[Photo: Wikipedia] At about the same time, as part of a push to raise its profile on the West Coast, the company broke ground on an ambitious, innovative 190-acre research/manufacturing operation located on land formerly devoted to walnut groves. In 2014, I wrote about this prototypical Silicon Valley corporate campus, including the strange story of Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev's visit in 1959. (He was more impressed by the cafeteria than the computers.) In 1986, IBM Research’s San Jose arm moved into its current home, IBM Research–Almaden. Judged purely on the surrounding natural splendor—rolling hills, parks, and preserves—it may have the most beautiful setting I’ve ever seen for a tech-company office. But the location, at the southern end of San Jose, is not exactly convenient to the rest of Silicon Valley. You need to do a fair amount of driving to get to Intel (20 miles to the north), Apple (21 miles), Google (26 miles), and Facebook (33 miles). That locale—proximity to the Valley's ecosystem, but not too much proximity—is intentional, even though many of its biggest players didn’t exist back in 1986 when the Almaden office opened. "When the labs were first started, the idea was to place them near strong academic centers and strong centers of business and commerce, but not right in the middle of them, necessarily," says Jeff Welser, the IBM VP who heads the Almaden operation. The original research center in Yorktown Heights, for instance, is about 40 minutes north of New York City. IBM Research-Almaden in all its atmospheric splendor. "We wanted to be close enough in that we can interact and take advantage of everything there, but separated enough that we can actually also do our work in our own area," says Welser. "Think deep thoughts, as our founder would say. In fact, actually at lunchtime, you'll see people literally walking a loop around this lab because you get a beautiful view of the valley." Jeff Welser The Almaden building does feel like a refuge where gifted scientists can squirrel up in their offices and put their brainpower to work without distraction, though it's hardly antisocial. (An open area called THINKlab is specifically designed to facilitate collaboration between IBM clients and researchers with various areas of expertise.) IBM Research's rich legacy testifies to the approach's success. "Historically speaking, large corporate research organizations have had varying kinds of success," says Guru Banavar, VP of cognitive computing. "I would say IBM corporate research has been the most successful in terms of scale and impact." As the official IBM Research-Almaden timeline indicates, the facility’s three decades of history are a chronology of what was important to the company at any given point in time. Data—how to store it, retrieve it, and make it useful—has been an ongoing theme. In 1970, the relational database was invented there. In 1988, its researchers created a standard for speedier data recording on a disk. In 1998, as mobile devices gained in importance, the lab developed the Microdrive, a tiny hard disk. And in 2002, it proposed a database designed with protecting the privacy of personal data in mind. Today, "If I had to sum up in a nutshell what this lab does," says Welser, "it's all about using data to expand what the human mind can do. That really is in essence what cognitive computing is about." Despite IBM Research-Almaden's scholarly air, people are drawn here in part by the opportunity to create things that will be turned into businesses. "If you are someone who really wants to do academic research, you want to be a professor, you want to teach the next generation of students, a university is the right place to go." Welser says. "But if you want to be able to do deep research and have that get translated rapidly into something in a very broad portfolio of potential application areas, that's the kind of person that really likes IBM Research." Watson is best used to help human beings make more effective decisions more quickly. Some of the most wildly ambitious of those efforts—ones of the sort that Google would call moonshots—are instigated by IBM's Grand Challenges program. Watson itself originated as a Grand Challenge, back when the notion of training a computer to play Jeopardy better than a human champion sounded—at least to those of us who aren't among the world's savviest computer scientists—to be downright fanciful. That challenge was met. And now IBM researchers are leveraging Watson to tackle feats that could be far more meaningful than providing questions for Alex Trebek's answers. Welser defines a Grand Challenge as "something that, at this point, we don’t know if we can do or not, but if we could do it, it would make a huge difference to us, to our clients, to the world." One such project, dubbed "the Medical Sieve," aims to use cognitive-computing technology to analyze radiology images for signs of abnormalities such as aortic aneurysms. The Medical Sieve exemplifies IBM's philosophy that Watson is best used to help human beings make more effective decisions more quickly, rather than to eliminate humans from the decision-making process altogether. "A radiologist in a typical emergency room situation may look at as many as 100,000 images a day," says Tanveer Syed-Mahmood, the IBM fellow who heads up the effort. "With that volume of imaging, they do have an overload in terms of high fatigue." The Medical Sieve's goal is to create an automated assistant that's as skilled at analyzing images as an entry-level radiologist, thereby freeing up time for medical professionals such as cardiologists to focus on work that requires their advanced expertise. Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood Of course, a task that would be entry-level work for a person is a remarkable accomplishment for a computer. "It has to apply clinical knowledge," says Syed-Mahmood. "It has to understand the appearance of organs in images and recognize them from different viewpoints. It has to reason with the information, know what the guidelines are, in order to cull this data, simplify it, and present it to the clinician." A range of IBM experts in AI, image processing, and medical topics are collaborating on the effort, along with external partners such as doctors; in 2015, the company also acquired Chicago-based imaging company Merge Healthcare to aid in the effort. IBM Research's Medical Sieve aims to turn computers into medical-imaging experts. Elsewhere in IBM Research-Almaden, other scientists are working on "brain-inspired computing," a project—funded in part by the U.S. Department of Defense's DARPA—to create processors that think like humans. In the future, data centers utilizing vast quantities of such processors could be optimized for AI applications such as Watson's cognitive computing in ways that current computers are not. Dharmendra Modha, the IBM fellow spearheading this research, is an IBM veteran who left for a spell to form his own startup, but he was lured back by IBM Research-Almaden's ambition, approach, and resources. "I live just down the hill here," he says. "Every day, I come up and it's just such a fresh experience that I'm grateful." Watson In San Francisco The fact that IBM Research-Almaden is situated on the southern periphery of Silicon Valley means that it’s really quite far from San Francisco, which is well over an hour's drive away. But San Francisco, more than Silicon Valley, is the current epicenter of startup culture, which made it the logical place to build Watson West. (IBM already has another San Francisco office located right around the corner from Watson West: IBM Bluemix Garage, which helps developers and customers work with its cloud platform.) If IBM Research labs are traditionally built a little out of the way to encourage contemplation, Watson West more or less flips that approach on its head: It's an interface with the outside world that's right in the middle of everything, with sweeping windows that never let you forget you’re deep in the heart of San Francisco. The headquarters of kids’ clothing retailer Gymboree are across the street—so close that its employees play tic-tac-toe with IBMers using a game board affixed to a window. A peek at the Watson Experience at Watson West before its grand opening. Much of the space at Watson West is devoted to rows of cubicles for developers, designers, and researchers, looking pretty much like the environs of any tech company. But there's also the Watson Experience Center, an area that IBM will use to show outsiders what cognitive computing is capable of doing for their businesses. Like its predecessor at Watson's New York headquarters, San Francisco's Watson Experience Center has a high razzle-dazzle component; I find it reminiscent of a futuristic pavilion at Disney World's Epcot. A giant projection wall controlled by a touch screen lets visitors explore demos such as one involving a browsable guide to TED Talks that Watson created by crunching hours of raw footage and identifying topics and people. Nearby is a 360-degree multimedia theater where IBM can show off lavish, interactive mini-movies about specific Watson scenarios, including applications in medicine and commerce. I can't imagine anyone spending time there and leaving without feeling inspired by Watson's potential. IBM's decentralized approach to innovation involves 12 labs on six continents. Bay Area startups and other locals who want to learn about cognitive computing are the most obvious constituency for Watson West, but IBM expects to draw guests from near and far. "A lot of people from around the world who do tours of Silicon Valley ask for a place to go as they figure out how to put all this together," says Kenny. But that brings up an important point: Just as IBM has been in the Bay Area for more than 70 years to accomplish tasks it can't handle solely from the East Coast, it has aspirations that it knows can't be fulfilled entirely by people based on the West Coast of the United States, no matter how skilled they are. That explains why IBM's approach to innovation is so decentralized, with 12 labs on six continents. "If you think about the kinds of challenges that developing countries in Africa or developing countries like Brazil might face, having researchers there immersed in it helps us come up with what they might need there," says Welser. "Rather than me guessing, from this beautiful place I live in California, what they might need in Africa. That's really the idea of having a whole global spread." In other words, the company that's still formally known as "International Business Machines" remains deeply serious about the "International" part of its name—and Silicon Valley, important though it is, is only one pushpin on its map.

The pop-up is to celebrate the new 2017 New York City Restaurants Guidebook and the relaunch of the restaurant review iOS app from the Google-owned company. The app offers restaurant guidance from editors who curate snippets from user reviews, with the data coming from Google's Local Guides program. Using that same concept — "small reviews are easier to digest" — the pop-up offers free, tiny versions of food from the top-rated restaurants on the app. I'm a long-time lover of tiny food, so nothing was going to keep me away from my chance to eat microscopic versions of New York's best-rated, most Instagrammed meals. Standing around the outdoor pop-up in 40-degree weather, I waited for my food amid the deafening sounds of ambulance sirens and construction. My phone eventually shut down from the cold, and I anxiously waited for it to turn back on, using my own body heat to warm it. Yet I persisted; I had to do it for the 'gram. In NYC? Stop by the #TinyCafe at Astor Place tomorrow and Saturday from 11-7 to watch tiny dishes be made (and then eat them!). We've got @jacquestorres chocolate chip cookies, @lostacos1 tacos and @pizzalovesemily pizza and burgers. And they're free!

A sharp gust of wind blew the tiny portions of tiny food away, shattering the doll-furniture plates and sending miniscule hamburger buns flying across the sidewalk. I laughed at the disaster and internally cried from the cuteness of it all, then patiently waited for another batch of tiny food to come out. Three bites and approximately 45 calories' worth of food later, it was over. Taste-wise, it was about the same as the originals. I'd had the $19 full-sized version of the burger from Emily before, and the experience was like taking an extremely small, crumb-sized bite out of it. But I wasn't there for the food, of course. Like any self-respecting millennial, I was there to be able to say I was there. I wiped my nose, and left to go get regular-sized lunch.

By Jack Wallen | October 28, 2016, 11:10 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen For some users, the Chromebook isn't an option because they believe it exists entirely in the cloud. With the latest iteration of Chrome OS (on certain devices), that has become a completely outmoded idea. Now that Google is rolling out Android app support for more and more Chromebooks, it is absolutely possible to take the devices back from the cloud and work locally. Although it is has been possible to achieve this from the start by working offline, people weren't happy until they had their hands on a standard locally-running/saving app. Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy That time has come. Now that you can run Android apps on Chrome OS, the likes of WPS Office can be added to the Chrome OS arsenal of productivity apps. The best part is you can link WPS Office to your Dropbox account and work both out of and in the cloud. Let's install WPS Office and link it to a Dropbox account. SEE: Chromebooks: The smart person's guide Installation The first thing you must do is install WPS Office—this can only be done on a Chromebook that supports the installation of Android apps. To find out what devices are currently supported and on which devices support is coming, check out this official list. You will also need to have the Google Play Store enabled on your device (read my article, "How to install Android apps on your supported Chromebook"). Now all you have to do is follow these steps. Click the Chrome OS menu. Locate and click the Play Store (beta) icon. Search for WPS Office. Locate and click the entry by Kingsoft Office Software. Click INSTALL. Allow the installation to complete. You should see an entry for WPS Office in your Chrome OS menu. Click to open the app. Connecting Dropbox You're ready to work with local files, using WPS Office. If you want to extend it to the cloud, when you open WPS Office, click Open from the left pane (Figure A). Figure A Ready to connect WPS Office to Dropbox. Click the Dropbox entry and then, when prompted, click Next. You will be required to enter your Dropbox credentials (Figure B). After entering your credentials (and hopefully your two-factor authentication code...as you should have that enabled), click Allow to give WPS access to the files and folders within Dropbox. Figure B Logging into Dropbox through WPS Office. After you've allowed WPS access to Dropbox, the app is linked and ready to go. Every time you open WPS Office, you can click Open | Dropbox and your files/folders will be available. You can also add your Google Drive account to WPS Office by clicking Add (from Open | Location), select Google Drive, enter your credentials (and, once again, your two-factor code), click Allow to give WPS access to your Drive files, and you're good to go. SEE: Gallery: Samsung's high-end Chromebooks breaks cover (ZDNet) A perfect combination If you want to work with documents locally on your Chromebook and Google Drive offline isn't cutting it for you, the combination of WPS Office and Dropbox are a perfect combination. Not only does this allow you to work locally, you can also easily get your files saved to your Dropbox cloud account. Add your Google Drive account to WPS, and you might stop using Google Docs in favor of this outstanding solution. For more cloud tips and tricks, subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter.

Freebies Inspiration Advertise Hosting Ecommerce Platforms Website Builders Ecommerce Websites Navigate to Updates The Ultimate Guide to Optimizing SEO in WIX October 27, 2016 • By Design Reviver Team If you’re running a site on the WIX platform, you may have some questions as to how you can go about optimizing your SEO and making sure that potential customers find you through places like Google and Bing. WIX has a wonderful mix of design possibilities and SEO options. It’s rather easy to implement changes to content, while also having the tools to rank in search engines. Furthermore, even more advanced developers can get their hands dirty with custom coding and more complex SEO tactics. Building a website is one thing, but ensuring that it’s visible online is a completely different animal. In addition, one of the biggest questions about WIX is whether or not it has the tools necessary to make your site all that visible online. We figure many WIX users simply don’t know how to go about handling the complexities of SEO, or they don’t feel like spending the time. However, optimizing SEO with WIX is actually pretty darn easy, and we figure many webmasters just don’t have a comprehensive list on what to optimize. Therefore, follow the steps below to optimize SEO on WIX. Step 1: Fill in Your Entire Site with Valuable Content Although the following steps are more technical in nature, nothing in the SEO world beats having the proper information filled in on your website. For example, a site for a car hardware store is not going to see any search engine results if it fails to reveal contact information, a map, an About Us page, services, a contact form and other information like social media profiles. Therefore, start the SEO process by combing through your website and ensuring that all the information is there. Step 2: Manage Your Image SEO The reason we have this as Step 2 is because so many people forget about image optimization. It’s one of the few ways you can truly standout from your competitors, because so many companies forget about it. When in the WIX editor, you have the option to upload an image or edit the images currently on the website. You can click on an image to reveal the Image Settings. You’ll see a field that says “What’s in the image? Tell Google.” This is the alt tag for your image, or the text that explains what the image is to Google, since search engines can’t read photos. You shouldn’t get too crazy with your image SEO, since the whole point is to make it more useful for the users and search engines. So, if you have a photo of a red apple, call it “red apple.” This is far better than having a generic name or something like “screenshot123.” Step 3: Optimize Your Heading and Meta Tags If you have content on a page, WIX generates heading and meta tags for you by default. The only problem is that manually adjusting these is usually better than going the automated route. In short, these tags are what show up as titles and descriptions in Google search results. Therefore, it’s rather important to make them count. In the Pages tab, go to the Home button. Then click on the SEO (Google) tab to open up options for modifying your heading and meta tags. It will ask you to fill in the page’s title along with what the page is all about. This way you have more control over what users are seeing when they land on one of your search engine listings. Step 4: Activate the Site Booster App One of the main reasons webmasters hire SEO professionals is to get listed on internet directories like Google Maps, Yelp, Yahoo and Bing. It’s tough to fill in all of these listings by hand, so paying someone to do it seems logical. WIX has an alternative to paying a professional, and it comes in the form of the Site Booster App. Click on the prior link, and click on the Add App button. This activates it for your store and asks you questions (like contact information, hours and what you sell) for filling in a directory profile. After that, all the work is done for you, since the app sends out the necessary details to the hundreds of directories people search through. Step 5: Consider Completing 301 Redirects for Necessary Pages If you plan on shifting some pages, or a full site, to a new domain, you may be worried about losing the SEO power you built up from the previous site. This doesn’t apply to every person reading this article, but if you’re concerned about transferring a site or making a new webpage to replace an old one, we recommend checking out the 301 redirect documentation from WIX. Step 6: Get a Custom Domain and Create a Professional Online Presence You can have a free WIX domain, but a great way to make your brand look more professional and legitimate to the search engines is to opt for a custom domain. When you purchase a domain through Wix, you can choose from 33 different domain endings. Each TLD has its own benefits, so you can find the one that best suits your website. Step 7: Let Google Know About Your Website Google will eventually find your site overtime. However, if you feel like it’s taking too long, or you’d like to speed up the process, you might consider submitting to Google. It only requires a quick copy and paste, then the process is started to ensure that Google sees your site and presents it to people who search for your services or products. Step 8: Check All Your Bases With SEO Wizard The SEO Wizard from WIX is your best friend after you’ve walked through all of these SEO steps. It’s an app that serves as a step-by-step guide to optimizing your website. The app tests all of the primary SEO steps, and tells you if you could use some work in some of the areas. Over to You… If you’d like to find out more bout Wix SEO , please check out their informative page. Now that you’ve had a chance to learn about optimizing your SEO in WIX, please share any other SEO thoughts you might have when working through platforms like WIX.

WSJ's Geoffrey Fowler and Joanna Stern gaze into our near future. December 30th 2015 a year ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Artificial intelligence is being used to predict and prevent crime, though in a different way to Minority Report. Picture: Supplied Jennifer Dudley-NicholsonNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend EXCLUSIVE “YOU’LL be sitting at your desk one day and an ambulance will come and take to the hospital because you’re about to have a heart attack. The ambulance will just arrive.” This is the extreme scenario Telstra chief scientist Dr Hugh Bradlow foresees as a result of artificial intelligence increasingly added to our gadgets, from smartphones and wearable technology, to connected appliances and Fitbits. GOOGLE TRICKS: 13 hidden features inside Google’s Pixel smartphone PIXEL PERFECT: Can Google’s first phone beat Samsung and Apple? The programming, he says, could be used to do everything from predicting and preventing crime, to picking restaurants and ensuring travellers don’t find themselves homeless. And the pace of AI innovation is accelerating, with Google emerging as a major advocate of smarter technology. Google Assistant is the artificial intelligence engine built into the internet giant's new Pixel smartphone. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Dr Bradlow says the heart-saving scenario above will be possible as long as you feed the right information to the right computer. “You could be wearing a Band-Aid that measures your heart rate and that information is transmitted to a data centre running an algorithm looking for anomalies,” he explains. This artificial intelligence could be used to prevent crime too, though in a way divorced from Minority Report. The Stanford University study Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030found “predictive policing,” or using computers to analyse crime information, could “significantly” enhance the police force’s ability to predict where crimes would happen and “actually remove or reduce human bias”. The technology is already being used in American cities including New York City and Washington DC, but Dr Bradlow says it could also play a part in smartphones. “Just say I want to go to a restaurant that’s safe for me to walk to,” he says. “If I ask my phone, it might not make the most obvious choice, but it might say this is the safest restaurant and I’ll make a booking. “It’s got your preferences, data from public sources like weather and traffic, and then data from organisational sources like crime data. It just aggregates them all.” While artificial intelligence has been used in small but convenient ways to date, Google is now throwing its weight behind making the technology mainstream. The internet giant recently launched its first phone with AI program Google Assistant built in, and users can ask the Pixel smartphone to translate foreign words, announce sports results, show their appointments, or find nearby Japanese restaurants. Dr Bradlow says the way Google Assistant is “baked into the operating system” will allow app developers to easily add information, making it smarter and more capable. If your plane is delayed and your hotel had been reserved through an app, for example, AI agents like Google Assistant or Apple’s Siri could contact the company and pass on up-to-date arrival information. While Dr Bradlow admits most people will just use these services to find and book restaurants and movies initially, they could eventually link up with internet-connected appliances, like air conditioners and lighting, to create a smart home that predicts your needs. “I envisage a world in which you say, ‘Goodnight house,’ and the house locks the doors or opens the cat flap, and does all of those things for you in one connected sweep,” he says.

The hackers who got into Podesta’s emails then archived the account and sent it to Wikileaks. On Friday, the latest daily batch of emails from Wikileaks included a chain starting with the phishing email, in which Clinton’s tech support help desk actually told Podesta that it was a genuine Gmail communication. It all started when Sara Latham, Podesta’s chief of staff, forwarded the phishing email to Charles Delavan, an IT staffer from the campaign’s help desk. Superficially, the email looked real: However, hovering the cursor over the “CHANGE PASSWORD” button would have revealed that the target was a link using the bit.ly link shortening service, something Google wouldn’t use. Someone operating a phishing scheme, however, would use one to hide the non-Google URL. Delavan didn’t scrutinize it to that degree, however, and sent this reply to Latham: Sara, This is a legitimate email. John needs to change his password immediately, and ensure that two-factor authentication is turned on his account. He can go to this link: https://myaccount.google.com/security to do both. It is absolutely imperative that this is done ASAP. If you or he has any questions, please reach out to me at [number removed] In fairness to Delavan, he doesn’t tell Podesta to click the link in the phishing email. Instead, he instructs the chairman to go directly to Google’s official page for password resets and turn on extra security measures as well. Two factor authentication makes it so that anyone trying to log into your account from a new device needs a code that is sent to your phone via text message. However, he never actually told Podesta NOT to click the link in the original email. That was his biggest mistake. Delavan’s vote of confidence led to Latham forwarding the whole chain to Podesta and Milia Fisher (Clinton’s “special assistant”) with this message at the top: The gmail one is REAL Milia, can you change – does JDP have the 2 step verification or do we need to do with him on the phone? Don’t want to lock him out of his in box! Sent from my iPhone It’s implied here that Fisher would be the one who actually ended up clicking the phishing link, since she is who Latham asked to change to password, but we can’t know that for sure. Again, note that with Delavan not making it more clear that whoever changes the password go to https://myaccount.google.com/security, the real password reset page, it makes sense that someone would click on the original phishing link. It may make even more sense if it was Fisher. She was only added to the chain in Latham’s last email, so she could have just read Latham’s final message, which reads like it’s just confirming Delavan’s contributions.

The headset itself costs £69 and comes bundled with a motion-sensitive remote control that can be used for navigation or gaming when you're strapped in. It's more expensive than Samsung's £60 rival Gear VR rival, but I'd argue it's worth paying that extra nine pounds. You can pick it up directly from Google or from EE or Carphone Warehouse. Before plonking down the cash however, beware that you're going to need the right smartphone to get the best out of it. That means, at the moment, you're stuck with Google's £599 Pixel. Read More This little-known Google Street View feature lets you travel back in time AP Photo/Eric Risberg The new Google Pixel phone is displayed following a product event Because the Daydream software is really integrated into the Android 7 operating system so you'll need an Android 7-running phone (and the Daydream app which is available today on the Play Store) to get the best out of it. Other phones running Android 7 will come in 2017 but for now it's only the Pixel and Pixel XL. Obviously there's no support for iPhones, but there's nothing to stop you using it as you would any other 'dumb' VR viewer with applicable third-party apps. Design Google Daydream Read More VR isn't just for gamers: Virtual reality ART exhibition will open in London next year The Daydream View headset is leaps and bounds ahead of Google Cardboard in terms of fit and comfort. For starters, it's got a headstrap. Rather than being made out of plastic like other headsets, it's crafted from fabric more akin to sportswear. Google says the Daydream View is 30% lighter than similar headsets and it can even be washed to keep it clean. It's available in three different colours: Crimson, slate and snow. Which means red, grey and white. It's a well thought-out and attractive design, but even so I experienced light leaking into the headset from around the nose. For best results, dim the lights around you while you use it. As mentioned above, the Daydream View comes with a small remote control that works a bit like the remote sticks for the Nintendo Wii. It tracks motion control and can be used to navigate menus and play games. There's a clever little hook inside the headset where you can store it when it's not being used. Content and usability Google Google's own stable of apps, including YouTube and Street View have already been configured to work with the platform, and you can use the remote to work your way through the apps. One of the big third-party "experiences" is the VR tie-in with JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. It has you using the remote to cast spells that in turn solve puzzles. There are also a few different games to play with. I tried one called Wonderglade which comprises a set of mini games such as moving the remote control to tilt and guide a ball around a virtual tabletop. Google Daydream view Another experience has you stepping inside the Natural History Museum to learn about sea-dwelling dinosaurs. Outside of strict virtual reality, Netflix and Google Play Movies will work with the headset and allow you to watch standard 2D content on a big screen in front of your eyes. The 360-degree vision of Daydream VR isn’t as seamless or crisp as the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, but then it is several hundred pounds cheaper, so bear that in mind. The Pixel phone also got quite hot during usage and - as you would expect - using VR pounds the battery. Read More Google's Halloween game doodle lets you fight ghosts with a spell-casting cat called Momo In terms of usability, compared to the PlayStation VR's headband design, the Daydream headset felt heavy strapped to my face with a smartphone inside it. Even though it’s one of the lightest headsets available (and much comfier than the plethora of plastic headsets around), it still took a few seconds to adjust to the weight pulling my face forward. The only other thing I found is that audio is a bit quiet if you're using it without any headphones. Pair it with a good set of wireless earbuds though and you can happily block off the real world for a while. Not too long though, or you'll find yourself with a headache and eye strain. The bundled controller is a masterstroke from Google because it allows you a point of reference within the virtual world. Read More Google Pixel phone stripped down by tech experts Google Daydream The tracking wasn't 100% on point, but it’s a much better system than trying to select menus using the accelerometer inside the phone. The remote itself is a bit smaller than a Roku or Amazon Fire Stick remote control but feels light and comfortable in your hand. Like many other newer gadgets, it charges via USB Type-C. Conclusion Google Daydream Read More Google Pixel on sale - Best deals and prices on EE, Vodafone, O2 and Carphone Warehouse If you're an Android phone user and have a passing interest in VR then getting the Daydream View is a no-brainer. However, I'd recommend holding off on buying it right away because of the lack of available phones. Developers have been working on it since May, so there's not going to be any shortage of stuff to do on it. But I still reckon it's worth waiting until 2017 and seeing what other phone manufacturers do with it on their own handsets. Of course, if you're one of the people that rushed out and got a Pixel right away then there's nothing to stop you getting a Daydream View headset now. It obviously isn't among the true virtual reality powerhouses like the Vive or Rift, but at £69 (plus phone) it's a tempting purchase.

Revenue jumped 20 per cent to $22.45 billion, marking the search giant’s seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth.   The company authorised a $7-billion repurchase of its Class C stock, pleasing investors who had been craving more after a $5-billion repurchase last year.   Google is competing fiercely with social network Facebook for dominance in the fast-growing mobile advertising market. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai touted the company’s gains in the space, and was bullish about recent product launches such as the Google Assistant, the Google Home smart speaker and refinements to the enterprise cloud business. The products are aimed at the rise of voice search, which many analysts believe will succeed keyboards and touch screens as a primary way users interact with devices.   “We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing,” Pichai said in a conference call. “This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the cloud.” Shares of Alphabet, the world’s No. 2 company by market value, were up 1.6 per cent in after-hours trading.   The company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $9.06, beating expectations of $8.63 a share on revenues of $22.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.   Google has been dogged by concerns about how it would nudge its vast web advertising business toward mobile, but the company’s recent performance has reassured Wall Street that the transition is well underway, said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.   “It’s showing that even though they’ve hit lifetime highs, there’s still room to run,” he said. Advertising revenue, the company’s lifeblood, rose 18.1 per cent to $19.82 billion in the third quarter. Paid clicks, or ads for which advertisers pay only when users click on them, rose 33 per cent, compared with a rise of 29 per cent in the second quarter.   Cost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11 per cent in the latest period, but investors are willing to forgive the slump, for now, as it suggests strong mobile growth, said analyst Kerry Rice of Needham & Co.                Reuters   YouTube continued to post robust gains, Pichai said. Over the past year, Google, Facebook and Twitter have all doubled down on video, a format where advertisers are willing to pay a premium for a few seconds of users’ undivided attention.   Advertising accounted for 89.1 per cent of Google’s total revenue in the quarter, and analysts are eager for the company to tap new sources of growth.   One of the leading contenders is Google’s cloud business, which drove a 38.8 per cent rise in the company’s “other revenue.”   “As we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment,” Pichai said.   A relatively late entrant to the cloud business, Google is trying to steal market share from industry leaders Amazon.com and Microsoft Amazon on Thursday reported a 55 per cent revenue increase in its cloud business.   “I would hesitate to say they are competing head-to-head, but they are making up for lost ground,” Rice said.   Alphabet’s “Other Bets” unit generated revenue of $197 million, primarily from Nest, Google Fiber and Verily units, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the call.   Alphabet said this week it was pausing the rollout of Fiber, a high-speed internet service, in some US cities and that its leader, Craig Barratt, would leave.   Porat played down analysts’ concerns of instability at Other Bets, which has suffered a wave of executive departures, including Nest founder Tony Fadell, self-driving car technology chief Chris Urmson and, most recently, Barratt.   “As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it’s inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,” Porat said.   Other Bets, which also includes research unit X, reported an operating loss of $865 million, down from a year-ago loss of $980 million. The narrowing loss suggests Porat is instilling the financial discipline investors have long hoped to see from the company, said Gillis.“Everybody loves Ruth,” he said.

Alphabet finance chief Ruth Porat said on Thursday that the company's moonshots will face "course corrections along the way and that some efforts will be more successful than others." Corrections are presumably underway, and the public is waiting to see the successes, 14 months after the Alphabet structure was put in place. Financially, Alphabet is still Google and Google is swimming in cash. Mobile, YouTube and search advertising drove third-quarter revenue up 20 percent and helped sales and profit exceed analysts' estimates. Its cash balance sits at $83 billion. Take a look at the Other Bets piece of Alphabet, and it's a very different story. Combining all the units, which include Nest thermostats, fiber for high-speed Internet, health-tech division Verily and autonomous vehicles, revenue equaled $197 million, or less than 1 percent of Alphabet's sales. Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi estimates the value of Other Bets at $7 a share, also less than 1 percent of the company's $817.35 stock price at Thursday's close. show chapters <p>Pro: Google needs to make these two major cultural shifts</p> <p>James Cakmak, Monness, Crespi, Hardt and Co., says Google needs to make changes to its cloud and enterprise strategy.</p> Pro: Google needs to make these two major cultural shifts    Friday, 28 Oct 2016 | 6:05 AM ET | 00:33 Porat made clear that most of these projects are pre-revenue, and that the key thing to look at is progress. For example, autonomous cars have now driven over 2 million miles and are now being tested in four cities, "enabling us to experience varied weather and driving conditions," she said. But problems within Alphabet's side projects go well beyond money. Top executives have been fleeing, leaving Alphabet without many of the visionaries who were tapped to turn moonshots into eventual reality. Nest founder Tony Fadell left in June, and Chris Urmson, the technology chief behind self-driving cars, departed in August. That month, Bill Maris, who founded and led the company's start-up investing arm GV, stepped aside. Most recently and perhaps most alarmingly, Google Fiber chief Craig Barrat announced his resignation this week. Barrat, who has a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford University and holds 34 patents, is the type of executive that was supposed to thrive under the Alphabet structure. In his 2015 founders letter announcing Alphabet's creation, CEO Larry Page listed seven things he was excited about, including "empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish." David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Larry Page chief executive officer of Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. Along with Barrat's exit, Alphabet also said that it's slowing the rollout of fiber. The wireless technology is currently available in 12 cities, with four coming online in the third quarter. Porat said the company is "pausing for now our work in eight cities where we've been in exploratory discussions." Alphabet investors today aren't the least bit concerned. The stock climbed another 1 percent on Friday and is up 12 percent over the past 12 months. It reached a record earlier this week. But this idea that the Google cash cow will indefinitely fund science experiments is now being tested. Even though Alphabet isn't publicly breaking out each unit's financials, the company is closely watching the overall cost structure. "Disciplined cost allocation across core Google and Other Bets, sound capital allocation and compelling valuation keep us positive," wrote Youssef Squali, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, in a report on Thursday after the results. Squali, like 91 percent of analysts covering the stock, recommends buying it. He estimates that revenue growth among Other Bets will slow every year through 2022, from 70 percent in 2016 to 11 percent in six years. Wall Street will likely give Alphabet plenty of latitude to fund those businesses as long as the costs remain immaterial. But conquering autonomous driving, aging, high-speed internet access and drone delivery will require a big combination of money and patience. The hefty turnover at Alphabet suggests that may be a difficult formula to get right.

(View our Privacy Policy) How a dot-com millionaire became a social media crusader against solar amendment Mary Ellen Klas, Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau Link View all Articles MARY ELLEN KLASTampa Bay Times Friday, October 28, 2016 2:30pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Jonathan Taylor, a venture capital investor and online marketing expert from Maitland, is self-financing an online campaign to urge the public to reject Amendment 1. (Courtesy of Jonathan Taylor) TALLAHASSEE — Meet Jonathan Taylor. He's one of those wealthy Internet start-up whizzes who wrote software in high school, moved to Silicon Valley, made it rich during the dot-com surge and created and sold two businesses. He's moved back to his roots in Florida and, at 45, is a self-described "mentor/investor" based in the Orlando suburb of Maitland. Related News/Archive About that solar energy amendment on the Florida primary ballot 3 Months Ago Solar energy amendment headed for primary, but will anyone vote? 3 Months Ago Solar shenanigans: Insider reveals strategy behind Amendment 1 4 Weeks Ago Until two weeks ago, the only political thing Taylor had ever done, he says, was vote. But when he got "irritated about the confusion over Amendment 1," he decided to personally finance his own Internet marketing campaign to "get the reality about the amendment out" and urge people to reject the utility industry-backed amendment that creates a new barrier to competition. "The language reads pro-consumer when in reality it's pro-confusion," said Taylor, a former Republican who says he is now "sort of without a party." "I have many intelligent friends who are pro-solar, who just didn't understand the realities of Amendment 1. It's pretty amazing, actually." Taylor has given himself a budget of $100,000 and, using his years of online marketing expertise, developed social media ads on Twitter and Facebook, created a website landing page called FloridianSolar.org, paid for boosted posts, and called out the utility-financed political committee for breaking Google's online advertising rules. In two weeks, his tracking software indicated that his efforts had reached five million voting-age Floridians. His personal posts, on his company's Entrenext website, reached three million Facebook users, has had more than 55,000 shares and 32,000 likes. Taylor makes a point of noting that he is not affiliated with Floridian's For Solar Choice, the solar industry-backed political committee opposing Amendment 1. "However, I sure like what they're saying," he says on his web site. By law, his effort must be reported by the political committee. It has reported about $36,000 in in-kind contributions last week and another $45,000 this week, said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Taylor's effort is one of dozens of "organic efforts by people who are coming up with their own ways to encourage people to "vote no' on Amendment 1," Glickman said. She has copies of people who have converted used campaign yard signs to Vote No on 1 signs, volunteers who are running phone banks, and a woman who made buttons featuring "a wolf in sheep's clothes" — a reference to what Supreme Court Justice Barbara Pariente called the amendment in a court ruling. Companies have posted information on their business sites; Florida crooner Jimmy Buffett has recorded a video; the Clearwater band Stone Marmot has recorded a song, and they have all done it at no expense to the opposition campaign, she said. The promoters of the amendment, Consumers for Smart Solar, are financed primarily by the state's investor-owned utilities. The group spent nearly $22 million promoting the amendment and running television ads. A telephone robocall from singer Pat Boone is also sponsored by the 60-Plus Association, which is funded heavily by the Koch brothers. By contrast, the Floridians for Solar Choice raised and spent $1.6 million in an unsuccessful attempt to put a rival amendment on the ballot. Taylor said his Internet campaign also revealed that Amendment 1 backers may not have been playing by Google's rules. He found that every Google search about the amendment produced two or three different ads, from different accounts, all pointing to content by Consumers for Smart Solar, the utility-supported political committee that is promoting the amendment. It was a violation of Google's online advertising rules because it drives up the price, intentionally crowds out all the ad positions and creates "an unfair advantage," Taylor explained. "There is no reason to have multiple ads and try to take all the ad positions, because people just click on one of them. They have this big war chest and they are spending it to minimize people's exposure." Taylor said that in his 15 years working on online marketing, "I've never seen anyone abuse the Google advertising ability in that way. It's been banned since the very beginning of search advertising. It's just cheating." Taylor said he took a screenshot, mentioned it on Facebook and then he and others reported it to Google. This week, the multiple ads were down. Google did not respond to requests for comment. Sarah Bascom, spokeswoman for Consumers for Smart Solar, denied that their ads had been "reported, flagged or taken down by Google." She also defended the need for multiple accounts. "With our opponents regularly spreading misinformation, we want to ensure that voters find factual information when they search for answers about Amendment 1,'' she said. "Using different ads allows us to send voters to the right place with the specific answers to their specific search or question." Bascom was not aware of Taylor, or that his effort was self-financed and reported. She suggested he was operating as a "dark money group." "Once again, we are operating in a fully transparent way, and you continue to give the benefit of the doubt to those who are not," she said. "It's the work of these groups, not our committee, that are increasing the cost of online advertising and crowding out his efforts." Taylor said he doesn't own any stock or investment in a solar company, although when he discovered that inventor Elon Musk owns a part of the solar installment firm, Solar City, he divested his stock in Musk's company, he said. He tells readers, "unfortunately I don't even have a solar system on my house right now. I had one two houses ago, but I haven't had time to research putting one on my new house." Taylor also said he has "nothing against power companies" but he doesn't like it "when companies try to fool me with misleading causes." In his research, he said was frustrated to learn that utilities take federal subsidies for their operations but "they don't want you to have them for solar." Taylor, who admits he drives a Tesla because it's "fast as hell," says he's not doing this "because I believe in green energy at any price. "I do it because I believe solar will be the most cost efficient way to generate power in this country in the future,'' he said. "Clearly, the power companies see this, too."

And like mom, it isn’t asking your permission to do what it wants with old photos. While millions of internet users embrace the tagging of family and friends in photos, others worried there’s something devious afoot are trying block Facebook as well as Google from amassing such data.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo. Credit: REUTERS As advances in facial recognition technology give companies the potential to profit from biometric data, privacy advocates see a pattern in how the world’s largest social network and search engine have sold users’ viewing histories for advertising. The companies insist that gathering data on what you look like isn’t against the law, even without your permission. If judges agree with Facebook and Google, they may be able to kill off lawsuits filed under a unique Illinois law that carries fines of $1 000 to $5 000 each time a person’s image is used without permission - big enough for a liability headache if claims on behalf of millions of consumers proceed as class actions. A loss by the companies could lead to new restrictions on using biometrics in the U.S., similar to those in Europe and Canada. Facebook declined to comment on its court fight. Google declined to comment on pending litigation. Courts have struggled over what qualifies as an injury to pursue a privacy case in lawsuits accusing Facebook and Google of siphoning users’ personal information from e-mails and monitoring their web browsing habits. Suits over selling the data to advertisers have often failed. This year, the US Supreme Court set a “concrete injury” standard for privacy suits, a ruling that both sides are using to argue their case ahead of a hearing Thursday in San Francisco over Facebook’s bid to dismiss the biometrics case. Google is fending off suits in Chicago, arguing that the Illinois statute can’t apply outside the state under the Constitution’s interstate commerce rules. Google also contends the Illinois law doesn’t regulate photos. Facebook encourages users to "tag" people in photographs they upload in their personal posts and the social network stores the collected information. The company uses a program it calls DeepFace to match other photos of a person. Alphabet Inc.’s cloud-based Google Photos service uses similar technology. The billions of images Facebook is thought to be collecting could be even more valuable to identity thieves than the names, addresses, and credit card numbers now targeted by hackers, according to privacy advocates and legal experts. While those types of information are mutable - even Social Security numbers can be changed - biometric data for retinas, fingerprints, hands, face geometry and blood samples, are unique identifiers. “Biometric identifiers are a key way to link together information about people,” such as discrete financial, medical and educational records, said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who isn’t involved in the case. Facebook has “cleverly got its users to improve the accuracy of its own database,” he said. And just how good is Facebook’s technology? According to the company’s research, DeepFace recognises faces with an accuracy rate of 97.35 percent compared with 97.5 percent for humans - including mothers. Rotenberg said the privacy concerns are twofold: Facebook might sell the information to retailers or be forced to turn it over to law enforcement - in both cases without users knowing it. While most of the earlier privacy lawsuits relied on federal wiretap laws, the facial recognition cases hinge on the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The Illinois residents who sued under the 2008 law say it gives them a “property interest” in the algorithms that constitute their digital identities -- in other words, that gives them grounds to accuse Facebook of real harm. Facebook got the case moved to San Francisco. “Just as trade secrets or subscriber lists can be proprietary to a company like Facebook, unique and unchangeable biometric identifiers are proprietary to individuals,” according to their complaint. They also claim an “informational injury” because Facebook didn’t get consent to collect their so-called faceprints. Facebook says the lawsuit should be thrown out because the users haven’t suffered a concrete injury such as physical harm, loss of money or property; or even a denial of their right to free speech or religion. The plaintiffs "have offered no specific or coherent allegations explaining how this collection and storage actually affects their privacy - much less causes them concrete harm," Facebook argued in a court filing. Facebook offered examples that might work, such as if users were identified in an embarrassing photo that cost them their jobs, were victims of identity theft, or were caught in a compromising situation that harmed their relationships. While one person might be able to bring such a case, a group lawsuit would be impossible because it would “create a sea of individualised issues,” Facebook says. Legal experts say it’s unclear which side will benefit from the Supreme Court’s “concrete harm” ruling in a case involving search engine operator Spokeo. "Spokeo is vague about what kinds of injury are concrete enough to count," said Julie Cohen, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. "Everybody is scrambling for advantage." Facebook v.

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan Friday, 28 Oct 2016 | 1:50 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters <p>Mahaney on Amazon: It&#039;s a &#039;buy on the blip&#039; moment</p> <p>Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets Lead Internet Analyst, and Kate Mitchell, Scale Venture Partners Co-Founder and Partner, discuss Amazon and Alphabet earnings.</p> Mahaney on Amazon: It's a 'buy on the blip' moment    Friday, 28 Oct 2016 | 11:03 AM ET | 04:07 A year after Google became Alphabet, the company's emphasis on financial discipline seems to be working — at least for Wall Street. Wall Street veteran Ruth Porat has been seen as the architect of holding company Alphabet, living up to predictions that she would return cash to shareholders and reign in "moonshot" expenses after joining Google as chief financial officer in 2015. "I think Ruth is also showing she's balancing out new investments with their core business in a much more predictable way," Kate Mitchell, co-founder of Scale Venture Partners, told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Friday. "They've really settled down, and they're consistent at delivering." Google parent Alphabet's shares rose nearly 2 percent on Friday after announcing better-than-expected financial results and a $7 billion stock buyback. It traded in stark contrast to Amazon, which dropped 4 percent amid aggressive, widespread investment plans, a long-time philosophy of the company. After better-than-expected earnings and a generous return to shareholders, Alphabet's stock is looking cheap compared to the overall market, said Eric Sheridan, managing director, UBS equity research, told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Friday. The buyback is a message to Wall Street about Alphabet's confidence in the business, said Mitchell. Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page announced Google's new corporate structure last year, creating a collection of companies called Alphabet and adding transparency between core businesses — such as search, Android and YouTube — and its more creative endeavors: "smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange." "That core advertising business — that's doing super well for them. I don't think they should steer too far afield from that." -Mark Mahaney, Managing director at RBC During the third quarter, Google's revenues rose to $22.25 billion, thanks in part to YouTube and mobile, while "other bets" revenue rose to $197 million, thanks to Nest, Fiber and Verily, said Porat. "They're going to experiment for a while. Why shouldn't they? They've got a billion people that come to their site on a monthly basis," Mark Mahaney, managing director at RBC, said of YouTube on "Squawk Alley" on Friday. "That core advertising business — that's doing super well for them. I don't think they should steer too far afield from that." Google hasn't completely shied away from new products, investing in marketing for its new Pixel handset, despite having limited success as a hardware company. But Pixel builds on the core competencies of artificial intelligence and mobile-first ads — an area where Google has "killed it," Mitchell said. "The core advertising business — the real reason that we're still bulls on the stock — remains so consistent," Mahaney said. "This is now 19 quarters in a row of 20 percent year-over-year growth. For that reason, and almost for that reason alone, this thing remains a long for us. It's our number 2 pick in the space." Joe Scarnici | Getty Images Ruth Porat Still, it's not all blue skies in Mountain View, some have reported. The company's modular phone, Project Ara, was scrapped, and smart home unit Nest underwent reorganization. "With a focus on balancing costs vs. revenue opportunities under a new CFO, we think Alphabet will continue to climb a wall of worry that has persisted since early 2015," Sheridan wrote in a research note on Friday. "Longer term, achieving a balance between innovation (e.g., "Other Bets") & shareholder expectations will be key to the investment story." Google's Fiber project was another ambitious project to stumble this year. The project aims to outfit whole cities with internet connections up to 1,000 megabits per second. In a blog post titled "Advancing our amazing bet," the project's CEO Craig Barratt announced that he would step aside, as the company had "paused its operations and offices" in potential expansion sites. When asked about Fiber, Porat gave a long-winded answer. "In terms of Fiber, the impetus for it was really about the opportunities that we see to focus on innovation. And what does that mean if the objective with other bets is really these 10x opportunities? When you go back to the original impetus for creating the business, it was the founders' view that there's a sizeable opportunity, given the need for abundant connectivity, and networks that are always fast and always open. And we do continue to be committed to that vision. The team had some important breakthroughs and new technologies….the most important in our view, all that we're doing with wireless, but also technologies that are key to implementation. We believe that both of those — a number of things they're doing — enhance both our effectiveness and efficiency. So we want to focus on the potential of these efforts before we accelerate redeployment. And it was about ensuring that we can take advantage of those before pushing forth." Amid a flurry of key departures, one analyst pressed concerns that engineers were leaving the company to found breakout hits like Niantic (the firm behind Pokemon Go) and Otto, acquired by Uber. Google CEO Sundar Pichai pushed back at any connection to the Alphabet structure. "Overall when I look across Google and Alphabet, the number of areas where we've been able to build world-class products and achieve scale and success — we've had over 7 products that serve a billion users each — so I think our track record speaks there," Pichai said. "And we generally want to encourage a culture of innovation, and that's what we focus on. I think it is fine that some of them happen outside. So we don't view it as a zero-sum game and we're very comfortable with how we approach it." Disclosure: UBS has more than 1 percent stock ownership in Alphabet, and Alphabet is an investment banking client of UBS. RBC Capital Markets has provided Alphabet with non-securities services in the past 12 months.

The 21st email release included the actual March 19, 2016, email which provided the hackers with Podesta’s password. Podesta had received an email claiming to be from Google, warning him that someone in Ukraine had obtained his password, and that he was required to change it. The form they linked to, however, was not from Google, but from a site mirroring the internet giant, which, after the password was unthinkingly reset within it, then sent his new password to the hacker. — Poliphilosophy (@poliphilosophy) October 28, 2016 The phishing email came from no-reply@accounts.googlemail.com, which is not actually Google. — Alexander Higgins (@kr3at) October 28, 2016 The initial email read as follows: “Someone just used your password to try to sign in to your Google Account john.podesta@gmail.com. Details: Saturday, 19 March, 8:34:30 UTC IP Address: 134.249.139.239 Location: Ukraine Google stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password  immediately.” © AFP 2016/ Jewel Samad WikiLeaks: Clinton Team 'Doesn't Value Black Folks', 'Black Advisor' Would HelpIt also included a link to the fake password reset, which was located at “myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage.tk,” a simple observation that should have tipped the campaign off that the request was not real, as the domain.tk is from Tokelau, a small island off the coast of New Zealand, controlled by that country. “Sara, This is a legitimate email. John needs to change his password immediately, and ensure that two-factor authentication is turned on his account,” wrote Charles Delavan, a Hillary for America help desk staffer, to Sara Latham, Podesta’s chief of staff. Latham quickly sent a panicked email to Podesta, and copied the Hillary for America tech manager Michael Fisher, who, ironically, used to work at Google, and should have immediately known that the email was a simple phishing attack “The gmail one is REAL Milia, can you change — does JDP have the 2 step verification or do we need to do with him on the phone? Don't want to lock him out of his in box!” Based on the fact that we are now reading these emails, we can assume that Podesta took some ill-advised advice. ...

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — In an alert from Google dated March 19, 2016, Podesta was told, “Someone just used your password to try to sign in to your Google Account” from internet address 134.249.139.239, which indicated the location as Ukraine. Following that message, Clinton campaign technician Charles Delavan wrote, also on March 19: “This is a legitimate email.

It is absolutely imperative that this is done ASAP.” Pixabay Reasonable Doubt, Anyone? 'Only a Non-Russian Speaker Would Use Domain From Which the DNC Hack Took Place'Podesta’s assistant Sarah Latham had forwarded the email to Delavan to determine its authenticity, the email thread posted by WikiLeaks indicates. Including Friday’s batch, WikiLeaks since October 8 has posted nearly 36,000 emails involving Podesta and other Democratic Party figures. Prior to joining Clinton’s campaign, Podesta worked in the private sector and before that was President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff from 1998 to 2001. The US intelligence community, Carlin added, must have been highly confident in its assessments to release it publicly. In July, US media alleged that investigators blamed Russian-linked hackers for a breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) email system that revealed party officials colluded to support Hillary Clinton’s election campaign. Russian authorities, including President Vladimir Putin have repeatedly denied the claims. ...

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 28, 2016 1:41pm   Comments Share: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported a top- and bottom-line beats with revenue growth of 23 percent driven by strong performance at mobile search, YouTube, Google Play and Cloud. Following the results, Credit Suisse maintained its Outperform rating and raised its target price on the shares to $1,120 from $1,070, saying, “Machine learning drove product improvement as well as efficiency.” Alphabet-owned Google reported third-quarter adjusted EPS of $9.06 above Credit Suisse's estimate of $8.08 and consensus’ $8.61. The company’s net revenue of $18.3 billion also topped CS’ $18.1 billion estimate and consensus’ $18.0 billion. “We continue to anticipate benefits from recent ad product rollouts (Expanded Text Ads, etc.) as ongoing catalysts,” analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note. Though higher-than-expected traffic acquisition costs led to about 20bp adj EBITDA margin compression, the analyst focuses on the absolute growth of profit dollars as opposed to margin percent. Google Site revenues rose 23 percent to $$16.1 billion versus Credit Suisse’ $16.0 billion estimate, while Google's Network revenues came in at $3.7 billion (up 1 percent year over year) versus Credit Suisse’ $3.9 billion estimate. As for Google's L&O line, the analyst believes Google Play grew about 47 percent in the quarter on an FX-neutral basis and sees fourth quarter rate to decrease to about 28 percent. Ju raised his FY16 net revenue forecast by 21bps on higher Web Sites and Licensing & Other revenue, and adj. EPS view for FY16 by 2.4 percent to $34.11 from prior estimate of $33.29. Ju’s bullish thesis on Alphabet is based on: “Continued narrowing of mobile-desktop monetization gap in Int'l combined with eventual higher pricing for mobile CPCs.” “Larger-than-expected contribution from Google's larger non-search businesses, namely YouTube and Google Play.” “Optionality and upward bias to estimates and shareholder value creation from Alphabet's other bets.” At the time of writing, GOOGL shares of Alphabet rose 2.01 percent to $833.74. The revised target of $1,120 represents a potential upside of 34 percent from current levels.

When SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer took to Twitter a few days prior to the event and stated that eight years down the line we would remember October 4 as a day just as important as the birth of Android itself, I strongly believe that this move is what he referred to. Not just the Pixel phones, not just the Assistant, but rather a unified — if a bit prototypical — package that marries the two under the label “Made by Google”. And what that means, if my understanding is correct, is that over at Mountain View things are just getting started… So first things first. You’ve probably read extensively about the two Pixel smartphones, and chances are that now that the brouhaha over their lack of water resistance or the iPhone-like price has settled, we can confidently say that these are the best Android smartphones around without being called crazy. I myself come from a Galaxy S7 edge — the device I crowned as the ‘Smartphone 1.0 era”s last straw — and after a little over a week of use, I feel like the switch’s pros have largely outweighed the cons. Namely, the speed and responsiveness of this device are simply ridiculous; I have never, ever experienced such a fluid, pleasing and virtually instant UI on Android, not even on a fresh out-of-the-box Nexus 5 or OnePlus One. I expected it to feel faster than the S7 edge, but what struck me is that I had not to look for it; it was glaringly obvious from the get go, and what’s more is that Android’s micro-lags simply are all but gone. And it’s precisely that kind of experience that, in my opinion, makes for a device you simply don’t want to go back from. As my colleague Stephen smartly put it, the Pixel is the best Android device ever because it is the least frustrating one ever. It’s the first one where Android shines in all its flexible and yet powerful prowess without getting in the way, working intelligently for you behind the scenes and allowing you to focus on what you actually want to do. Oh, and 7.1 looks beautiful, and its animations are gorgeous. However, what I’m seeing here is a bigger overarching theme, one I have long called for: serious integration between hardware and software — so-called optimization. The Pixel is indeed a good example of this: now that Google has been given much more space to work on the actual hardware, it managed to truly fine-tune the software and improve critical things such as touch latency — and it shows. These are not the kind of things you can advertise easily, but certainly features that users can actually appreciate (and notice) on a day to day basis, each and every of the hundreds of times they pick up their phone in any given day. That is, in fact, precisely what Google has been working on. The Pixel phones have no truly standout feature — unless you want to count the relatively half-baked Assistant — and actually lack some of the competition’s boasting. However, the simple fact that these devices just work may very well be enough, and precisely what Google needed to do with their first shot. And let me say it again: they absolutely nailed it. Think about it: Google is a newcomer in the hardware space, and that is proved by the fact that most of its marketing campaign is focussed almost entirely on selling people the idea of a handset made by them. You see it in the ads: a small “Pixel” sign followed by a giant “Made by Google“. Had they come with some magical new technology, people wouldn’t have been able to fully appreciate it, simply because of the fact that they are not known as a mass market smartphone maker — that is what they are working on, and they are trying to change that perception. And how are they doing it? Simple: by getting the basics right and building some ground to work on — while potentially making some money too. What you will hear for now is not that Google has brought something spectacular to the table; they’re just having a go at it for the very first time in the mainstream market, and they’re doing it right. Especially at a time when the Note 7’s spectacular fail has opened such a big door, the Pixel has a chance to try and fill the void left by the burnt-out Galaxy. It certainly won’t be able to do it overnight, but Google’s 2016 effort is one of establishment, not revolution. Google’s 2016 hardware effort is one of establishment, not revolution. After all, we more or less know that the Pixel’s voyage to consumerland has not exactly been a bed of roses; between Huawei‘s bailout and HTC‘s relatively rushed development cycle, there’s only so much Google could actually do. And let’s not forget that the man at the helm of Google’s hardware efforts, Rick Osterloh, has only joined the company about half a year ago, which means that expecting the Pixel phones to be a result-of-years-of-R&D breakthrough product would have meant that your calibration was a little off. You have every right to complain about the design’s dullness, but you have more than a few reasons to understand why that happened. There is a dichotomy between what Google wants you to know — i.e. that the Pixels are the first phones “designed, engineered and tested in house” — and the reality of it. It’s not that this isn’t a Google baby, or that HTC is anything beyond the claimed assembler (like Foxconn is to Apple), but simply that the hasty nine-months development simply can’t represent the company’s vision at its very best. “Their answer was essentially ‘we ran out of time’,” said David Pierce speaking on the Wired Podcast. The Pixel is then an incredibly successful compromise, if you will. However, if there’s one key bit we can extract from Osterloh’s speech at the firm’s event earlier this month, it’s that Google’s commitment towards hardware — and not just ‘hardware’, but high-end, consumer facing hardware — is serious, and that they’re in it “for the long run”. An interesting Bloomberg piece developed more on this idea, and among the most crucial parts is the fact that, as it appears, Google is already actively working on next year’s Pixel. Says the report: Now that Google is designing phones itself, the company can at long last put together a product roadmap going out several years. For example, last month [engineering VP Dave] Burke was able to see a photo taken by a Google handset that won’t debut until next fall. That “would have never happened with Nexus,” he says. Going forward, more and more of the phones’ guts will be developed in-house. Burke says the company will eventually be able to ship its own custom “silicon,” a buzzword for customized processors that make devices work better. And that, right there, is another highlight. Of course, this year Google has had to rely on Qualcomm and its Snapdragon 821 as its chip of choice, and while the already plenty capable SoC has indeed been optimized, its results are likely not what the company could achieve if it worked on its own custom processor — and Google indeed thinks as much, which means that in that aforementioned product roadmap, somewhere not necessarily too far down the line, we might see Google’s hardware division actually shine through and through, with ostensibly better results. What else was not ready for Google to show off as its next big splash in the tech world? You guessed it: Andromeda. We know that the search giant has actively being working on the new OS for quite some time now, and chances are that its absence from the October 4’s event was attributable much to its actual readiness status as to its very own importance, which would likely have stolen the limelight from the hardware galore had it made even a quick appearance at the event. Andromeda is a big project: by folding Chrome OS elements into Android, Google is essentially trying to create a Windows 10-like unified system that works on pretty much every form factor you can think of, with laptops/convertibles/2-in-1s representing the new key target. And, if rumor has it correctly, we might see the culmination of those years of work with ‘Bison’, the Google-made laptop that is set to be the first device of its kind running Andromeda. Back to the above-mentioned overarching theme: Google is still just teasing us, and between a much more mature concretization of its hardware vision and the revamped OS project, 2017 (and, indeed, the years to follow) will potentially be the actual defining moment of this new consumer-friendly face of the firm. Apple is expected to unveil the big iPhone redesign next year, and Samsung will likely make a ferocious and hungry comeback to prove that it’s everything but done — and who knows, considering how good Microsoft is getting at doing hardware, even their rumored Surface phone could have something nice going for it. In any case, the hardware game between companies is about to heat up again, and very significantly this time around. By all means, get a Pixel if you want the best Android experience there is and you need a phone right now — it’s an absolutely spectacular device which will leave you with no remorse. Buckle up though; things are about to get exciting.

SUBSCRIBE Report: AMP causing monetization frustration among some news publishers Others, such as CNN and The Washington Post, say they're having good experiences. Greg Sterling on October 28, 2016 at 12:44 pm More According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are meeting with mixed reviews from publishers. The core issue for publishers is that AMP pages don’t generate the same amount of revenue and don’t give publishers as much control over ads. The article asserts: For some publishers [preference for AMP in search results] is a problem, since their AMP pages do not currently generate advertising revenue at the same rate as their full mobile sites. Multiple publishers said an AMP pageview currently generates around half as much revenue as a pageview on their full mobile websites. That’s largely because of limitations related to the types of ad units AMP pages will allow and the ad technology providers that are currently integrated with the platform, those publishers say. AMP ads are standardized and don’t allow certain kinds of interstitials or takeovers, which enable publishers to charge more or offer more customization. However many of those higher-profile or customized units are objectionable to users. Google disputes the notion that AMP won’t monetize for publishers. Properly implemented, Google says, AMP pages can generate revenue comparable to publishers’ existing mobile sites. CNN and The Washington Post are cited in the article as examples of publishers whose AMP pages generate revenue at roughly the same levels as their mobile sites. The article also states that some publishers don’t want to go on the record discussing AMP challenges because they fear retaliation from Google. That conspiracy mindset isn’t helpful, however. Google needs to hear directly from publishers about their concerns and issues. Many of these publishers also believe, apparently, that AMP adoption will be forced on them as a ranking factor. While Google has said that AMP usage isn’t a ranking factor, page speed will become one soon. Google has said that AMP pages are 4x faster and use one-tenth the data compared to non-AMP pages and that, on average, AMP pages load in less than one second. As a practical matter, Google probably can never turn AMP directly into a ranking factor because it would get spanked by antitrust authorities (at least in Europe) were it to do so. As mentioned, a few publishers told the WSJ that they were generally happy with AMP performance and monetization. They added that an increasing percentage of their mobile page views are coming from AMP pages. AMP is Google’s attempt to make the mobile web a more user-friendly place and increase user willingness to visit mobile websites (vs. apps). That, in turn, will benefit mobile search usage. So while there’s a larger “altruistic” goal of speeding and cleaning up the mobile web, there’s also a very self-interested aspect to AMP that ties directly to mobile search revenue.

By Mary-Ann Russon October 28, 2016 18:24 BST Companies in the US are filing lawsuits against fake defendants to get injunctions to remove derogatory comments from search results Reuters Unlike in the EU, with no 'Right to be Forgotten' law to fall back on, dubious reputation management companies in the US have found a new way to get search engines such as Google and other content providers to remove embarrassing results – sue fake defendants so that court orders are issued compelling them to delist the material. UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh and Paul Alan Levy, an attorney specialising in free speech, decided to investigate 25 suspicious-looking court cases happening across the US and found that all of the cases involve plaintiffs that are representing themselves, and strangely enough, all the defendants seemed to agree to the injunctions being issued against them (which almost never happens). In the court documents for 15 of the cases, they found addresses listed for the defendants, so they asked a private investigator to pay them a visit, but he couldn't find any of the defendants at any of the listed addresses at all. So Volokh and Levy smelled a rat. The only point in filing a lawsuit is to get damages – usually money – so suing a fake defendant achieves nothing. But what if you weren't after damages, but were actually more interested in the court case's result, which is getting an injunction issued? "Google and various other Internet platforms have a policy: They won't take down material (or, in Google's case, remove it from Google indexes) just because someone says it's defamatory. Understandable – why would these companies want to adjudicate such factual disputes? But if they see a court order that declares that some material is defamatory, they tend to take down or de-index the material, relying on the court's decision," Volokh and Levy wrote in a piece for the Washington Post. "Yet the trouble is that these internet platforms can't really know if the injunction was issued against the actual author of the supposed defamation – or against a real person at all." Filing a lawsuit in another state to get an injunction Volokh and Levy said that they cottoned onto this new sneaky method of removing derogatory Google search results in August while looking into a strange case in the California Court of Appeal. In April 2015, Columbus, Georgia resident Matthew Chan wrote a series of derogatory reviews on Yelp and four other websites about a Georgia dentist called Mitul Patel, claiming he had been induced to visit the dentist's office after seeing an advertisement for an affordable dental cleaning deal. However, when he turned up for the appointment, the dentist was unwilling to provide the cleaning unless Chan paid for additional services. Patel, unhappy about the negative reviews posted on Yelp and the other sites, seemingly decided to file a lawsuit in the city of Baltimore, Maryland – a completely different state which has no jurisdiction whatsoever over anything that happens in Georgia. Patel claimed that Chan lived in Baltimore, Maryland, not Georgia, and his name was also misspelt in the lawsuit. He also included a document stating he and Chan had mutually decided to settle the case and that Chan had consented to remove the review from Yelp. Seeing these documents, Baltimore Judge Philip Senan Jackson signed off on the court order. Chan had no idea that this had taken place. The only thing he knew, was that one day, several months after he posted the reviews, he received an email from Yelp telling him that it was taking his comments down because it had received a court order concluding that the comments he made about Patel were defamatory. Reputation management companies allegedly behind the lawsuits Chan tracked down the court documents, then contacted Yelp and made it clear that he didn't live in Baltimore and had never agreed to settle any lawsuit about his comments. Luckily, Yelp listened to him, kept the review against Patel up and even added a "consumer alert" warning users that Patel's business is "issuing questionable legal threats" against businesses. "Who is behind these cases? For many of these, we don't know. As we mentioned, many of the plaintiffs might well not have known what was happening. They might have hired a reputation management company, expecting it to get the negative posts removed legitimately (eg. through a legitimate libel lawsuit, or through negotiation with the actual authors)," Volokh and Levy wrote. It turns out that Patel never actually filed the lawsuit at all. He simply signed an SEO contract with a company called SEO Profile Defense Network LLC, and after Chan filed a motion to vacate the Baltimore court order, Patel filed a similar motion to vacate. Patel's motion included a letter from his lawyer, which alleges that SEO Profile Defense Network LLC "apparently forged Dr Patel's signature to a Complaint and Consent Motion". SEO Profile Defense Network LLC is one of several reputation management business entities owned by one Richard Ruddie, but both Ruddie and the firm have steadfastly denied all allegations of any misconduct.

Register for an Exam Today> Venture Capitalists Turning to Space for Their Next Big Returns By Samantha Masunaga PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 28 2016 In 2010, Bessemer Venture Partners decided to invest in an intriguing start-up that would build and launch a network of small satellites for a fraction of the typical cost. Four years later, that small satellite and remote imaging company, Skybox Imaging, was acquired by Google for $500 million in cash. The company, now known as Terra Bella, has launched seven satellites into orbit. Terra Bella's lucrative exit, along with the well-publicized exploits of SpaceX (seen above), have helped spur increased investment in space and space-related start-ups by top venture capital firms better known for their support of technology companies like Yelp, LinkedIn and Jawbone. "When we saw that Google, a mainstream tech company, all of a sudden had an interest in space, that was a big moment to realize that space is now important to a lot of companies," said Sunil Nagaraj, vice president at Silicon Valley-based Bessemer. And whereas SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk has made clear he's willing to spend billions to establish a base on Mars, these VCs have more down-to-earth goals. "It's not just passion projects or philanthropists," said Nagaraj. "We're there to make money, and we're actually seeing that happening." In 2015, more than 50 venture capital firms invested in space or space-related companies -- the highest number in the 15 years that consultant Tauri Group has been tracking the data. The $1.8 billion invested in space companies last year also was a high, although that mostly reflects two big investments: a $1-billion stake in SpaceX by Google and Fidelity Investments, and $500 million in satellite constellation firm OneWeb by a group of investors. Even without these two deals, venture capital investments in space totaled $300 million in 2015, a significant increase from $94.3 million in 2014. Venture capital overall is flush with money seeking decent returns in a low-yield world. U.S. venture funds raised a total $32 billion from January through September, almost as much as in all of 2015 and a record-setting pace, according to the National Venture Capital Assn. Much of the interest in the space sector is in small satellite start-ups that capture images of the Earth and in data analytics companies that rely on feeds from small satellites. That data is valuable to industries such as agriculture, energy and forestry, according to venture capitalists and industry experts. "You've got this confluence of ... privatization of the space sector, lower costs of the space sector versus the past, and these large venture funds that are looking for opportunities to deploy capital," said Robert Siegel, a lecturer in management at Stanford University and partner at XSeed Capital. Technological advancements such as in batteries and the miniaturization of processors have allowed satellites to shrink dramatically. In the 1990s and even still today, satellites could be as large as a school bus. Now, they can be the size of a dorm room mini-fridge, or even a shoebox. "It used to be that if you wanted to do Earth observation ... you needed very big satellites," said Sven Strohband, partner and chief technology officer at Khosla Ventures, which has invested in Skybox, Los Angeles-based Rocket Lab and agricultural data firm Climate Corp, which was acquired by Monsanto Co. in 2013 for $930 million. "You can do an astonishing amount of work with a smaller satellite." Smaller sizes mean cheaper manufacturing costs, which have allowed companies like Terra Bella and the San Francisco-based Earth-imaging firm Planet to launch so-called satellite constellations that ensure that one or two failures won't knock out remote-sensing or Earth observation abilities. Building a shoebox-sized satellite can cost between $100,000 to $300,000, said Nagaraj of Bessemer. "It costs about as much to launch an app as it does to make and launch a satellite," he said. "We've reduced the cost of entry to start tinkering." The firm has invested more than $50 million across three space companies -- Skybox, Rocket Lab and small satellite maker Spire. Venture capitalists say these new satellite constellations should be more successful than those envisioned in the 1990s that were intended to provide telecommunications coverage across the globe. Because communications networks can't offer complete service with just one satellite, those constellations are an "all-or-nothing proposition," Nagaraj said. But with remote-sensing or Earth observation satellites, "you can derive value starting with satellite No. 1," he said. Nagaraj and Strohband said they see one to three space-related pitches a week. "There seems to be a new attraction to this because it is technologically possible ... and there's some early proof points that the economics can also be good," Strohband said. "I think that's going to continue for at least a little while." Image Credit: SpaceX (Interplanetary Transport System). © 2016 Los Angeles Times under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search I took Google’s Pixel XL on a photo tour down the Enchanted Highway Chris Burns - Oct 28, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit I took Google’s Pixel XL to the Enchanted Highway – and that’s not a euphemism. I went to the road by the name of Enchanted Highway in North Dakota, where I used the Google Pixel to capture photos. What’s here is a set of photos which show the Pixel’s real world abilities – lens flares included. The photographs shown above and below have cropping and some have been rotated just a bit. They also have some resizing done to them so that they could fit this web format. Otherwise there is no editing done to these images, all captured by the Pixel XL. You’ll notice the lack of editing immediately as the following photo shows glare from the window through which it was shot. I began capturing photos at around 5PM Central Time on the 22nd of October, 2016. The sun was on its way down, and by the time my family and I were about halfway done with the journey, it was getting dim. The photographs which show lens flares faced the sun with intention. That’s not to say that there is too much or too little flare for the subject matter. In fact at this point in history, a Google product forum for the Pixel has a response to a question about flares by Google. Google’s Pixel camera lead Isaac Reynolds suggested that they’re working on the issue now. “You can expect a software update in the next few weeks that will improve the effects of this issue,” said Reynolds. “We’re working on some algorithms that recognize the halo/arc flare, characterize it mathematically, and then subtract it from the image. You will need to use HDR+ to see the benefits of this software.” The Enchanted Highway is a stretch of road near the tiny town of Regent in Southwest North Dakota. This road is home to the world’s largest scrap metal artwork, according to Guinness Book of World Records. Artist Gary Greff began this project back in 1989 and continues to expand it through the present. You’ll see a number of birds here made of scrap along the highway. Characteristic of each of the sculptures, these birds sit in a field near a small parking area for tourists. Up close and personal you’ll see how each bird is made from painted metal bars and struts. Like the rest of the sculptures, these birds are not placed behind glass. They are not protected by large barbed-wire fences. They’re left out in the open for everyone to enjoy – for several reasons. One reason these sculptures are left out in the open is that the local community wants them to be enjoyed by all – for free. Another reason is that visitors have been intelligent enough not to bust their heads open on the sculptures thus far. The final reason is that anyone with the sand to drive this great a distance to see roadside attractions isn’t then going to turn around and deface them. The flattest of the sculptures is also the most celebratory. This is Teddy Roosevelt Rides Again – and you can see the glee in his face. The Pixel XL does a lot here to capture the environment: a barren land which is also green and full of life. Tiny life that comes out at night. The metal family in the photos below depict a standard sort of family from the area. Most people here aren’t farmers, but the farmer is just about as standardized a look as you’ll find in these parts. They’re eternally happy about their crops and their livestock. Human farmers generally don’t have skin made of metal. But human farmers don’t often weather the elements like these farmers have. Notice how the Pixel XL captures all the color we could ask for with its HDR+ capture mode – which is on by default. Reaching the town of Regent meant we were about to enter a place where both scrap metal sculptures and real human beings lived. We’d just watched the classic horror Children of the Corn on Netflix the night before, so apprehension came naturally. There didn’t seem to be anyone here – at first. The photo above was shot through a window of a vehicle moving 35-miles per hour. The Google Pixel XL’s digital zoom was zoomed 100% of the way in, and sunlight was fading. This photo is also cropped in a big way. The results are impressive for the situation, to be sure. Below you’ll see a series of images from the town of Regent. Do not be afraid, for this is not an abandoned town. Instead it is just a town where residents don’t generally walk around on the street on a windy Autumn night like we were about to experience. The town is built on the Enchanted Highway – its survival seems hitched on the survival of the sculptures. The sculptures on the highway are, of course, more well-known than the town. As such, it’s impossible to drive through the town without realizing where you are. At the far end of the town of Regent, Artist Gary Greff opened a hotel. This hotel goes by the name The Enchanted Castle. It is a very magical place where dreams come true. Just so long as your dream as a local pheasant hunter is to find a place to stay for the night in the town of Regent. The Enchanted Castle is a set of large pieces of cement arranged into a vaguely castle-like shape. There is a drawbridge, and there are rocks. Rocks are painted to look like water, and rocks are painted to look like grass. Parking is sort of hidden behind the retaining wall to keep the magic alive. The Enchanted Castle is attached to a run-down school which includes its own playground. There’s also a basketball court nearby, but no b-ball has been played there for some time. There’s also a stairway which has rotted and been victim to an overweight ghost, we must assume. This collection of items around the school looked to be the scraps with which the next generation of sculptures will be made. It’s also fairly clear that a giant version of Magneto is being made here – we’ve seen his helmet, anyway. Up front of the school was a set of lockers thrown face-down unto the ground. Also there was a bathtub, and the faint sound of a dog barking. Not barking outside, chained up by a house, but inside. Inside the boarded-up school. Above you’ll find the tossed-down set of lockers, while below you’ll see the bathtub. I regret not having recorded the sound of the ghost-dog’s yelps, but when you’re in the moment, sometimes you just panic. Panic and take a walk into a place you might not ever otherwise have gone. The Google Pixel XL did not fail us as the sun inched out of sight. We decided to heed the signs which suggested a new restaurant was open inside the Enchanted Castle, and entered. To one side, a front desk with a morning star affixed to the wall – to the other, a set of… armor. Several sets of decorative armor were placed throughout the halls, up to the point at which the hotel rooms began. It was very black and white. There were no tiny children standing near one-another asking us to play forever and ever. Also near the front desk was a door which opened to a fully revitalized and well-kept gymnasium. If any one element in this amalgamation of oddities felt most out of place, it was this. Down a separate hall was a medieval-themed sports bar, banners and all. Inside several hunters watched a football game from some neighboring state. I am 80% sure that they were not watching Quiddich. Further down the hall we came upon the restaurant Excalibur (steakhouse), complete with its own sword in the stone. The name of the restaurant is hewn into the living rock. With bright LED lights lighting it up to exemplify its beauty. We were led inside by a very friendly and helpful wait staff to discover we’d been placed in a dining hall from a horror movie. Regardless, the food we were served – by a man with a British accent – was genuinely tasty. Once served, we exited the building to see the most spectacular image of all. This carved shield let us know where we were. This carved shield is lit by lights as bright and multi-colored as the restaurant’s sword in stone. Wrap-up The Enchanted Castle is a mix of classical aesthetics and nightmare-style rooms, fine food, and what we guess might be decent accommodations. It’s all very unique, that much is certainly true. With us through it all was Google’s Pixel XL, without which we might not have captured such a strange tale with such clarity. This journey was not intended, at first, to be a photo tour that I’d be bringing to SlashGear. It just turned out that way. That in mind, consider the fact that I had a wide variety of options for this trip for photos. I had options in most major modern smartphones and high-quality cameras, too. But I trusted this Pixel, and I’ve come away quite pleased with the results. Have a peek at the timeline below for additional photo tours and strange journeys, including our full Pixel XL review.

Alphabet hides math joke in latest share buyback The internet search giant buried a math game in its share buyback announcement on Thursday. Google's parent company is fond of math jokes. The name Google is a play on googol, which is the number 1 followed by a hundred zeros.  (Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP)   By Mark BergenBloomberg Fri., Oct. 28, 2016 Alphabet Inc. is getting serious about reining in spending, but the math whizzes who run the company are still playing games when it comes to some big financial decisions. The internet search giant buried a math game in its share buyback announcement on Thursday. Google’s parent company said it will repurchase $7,019,340,976.83 (U.S.) worth of its Class C stock. That amount comes from the number of letters in the alphabet (Alphabet Inc., get it?) and “e,” an important mathematical constant that equals 2.71828.  Here’s the calculation, courtesy of Google’s search engine: 26 to the power of “e” equals 7019.34097683. Multiply that by $1 million and you get the new repurchase number. This is just the latest math joke from the company. Last year, Alphabet said it would buy back as many as $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C shares. To get that number, it took the square root of 26, then multiplied that by $1 billion. The company has been under pressure to return some of its huge cash hoard to shareholders, so the most-recent math games have focused on buybacks. But it’s been obsessed by large numbers since inception in the late 1990s. Article Continued Below The name Google is a play on googol, which is the number 1 followed by a hundred zeros. When it first filed to go public, it said it planned to raise $2,718,281,828, a billion times the value of “e.” Nearly a year later, it said it was going to sell 14,159,265 shares of stock. Those are the numbers that follow the decimal in pi. And when the company tried to buy Nortel Network patents, one of its bids was actually “pi” — around $3.14 billion. Its other bids were plays on numbers, too. Google lost the bid. Read more about: Google The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

For now, some of us still need powerful PCs. This week, we got to see that Microsoft and Apple are still intent on wowing our socks off when it comes to hardware for developers and creative professionals. With the new Surface Studio from Microsoft and the redesigned MacBook Pro from Apple, we’ve got some great options. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Surface Studio looks hot. So does the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Also see David’s hands-on report. Margaret Rhodes has some additional thoughts on the Touch Bar as well. There’s also a new Surface Book from Microsoft. David’s recommendation this week is Lessons From the Screenplay. Michael’s is the Jaybird X3 sweat-proof wireless earphones.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better.

We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently.

What we watch, what we watch it on, and what we do while we watch it. Not only is the technology of TV changing, but the content is morphing in a way that alters what we think of as “television.” Is a YouTube video TV? Sure, right. What about a Snapchat story, or a local city council meeting on Twitter? Yes—why not. The hosts discuss these changes in light of YouTube’s new app, Twitter’s new strategy, Snap’s new hardware, and Roku’s new future-proofed players.

Coren October 28, 2016 Hook me up. (Rural Electrification Adminustration) Share Written by Michael J. Coren October 28, 2016 It’s too expensive. No one wants to buy it. Laying cables is unprofitable. The government is overreaching. Objections to high-speed fiber broadband today sound like those facing rural electrification during the 1900s. History suggests they’ll prove wrong today as well. On Oct. 25, Google pressed “pause” on rolling out high-speed fiber across more US cities. In an announcement, Google Fiber said it was delaying fiber-to-home service in eight cities, including Dallas, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, to focus on the 12 urban markets where it is already working. The CEO of Access, the unit that includes Google Fiber, stepped down, and 9% of its 1,500 employees will be laid off, reports Bloomberg. Many heralded Google Fiber’s announcement as evidence of its folly. The model is proving too expensive and unscalable, even for Google’s deep pockets. Demand has not materialized. A lack of “killer applications” demands a slower approach. It’s just not profitable, contend Wall Street analysts. Almost all these criticisms were made in the process of electrifying America’s hinterlands, and that effort’s success should give critics of Google Fiber pause, said Joshua Lewis, an economics researcher at the University of Montreal, in an interview. Lewis’ research (pdf) found that the benefits of rural electrification defied almost every expectation about the cost, demand, and benefits for productivity and quality of life. “Over time, electrical utilities learned that this actually did turn out to be a profitable market,” said Lewis. Opposition rested on the assumption that rural residents wouldn’t pay for the technology, and pilots “proving” it was uneconomical to extend transmission lines outside cities. By 1930, almost every US city enjoyed electricity, while only 10% of farms and rural towns had access to power (a similar, if less stark, gap exists among high-speed internet access today). In response, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was created to loan money to rural communities for transmission lines. It was a runaway success. Within two years, 100,000 miles of power lines had been strung, reports Lewis (pdf), and utilities realized they were making money selling to the new customers. By 1955, 95% of farms were electrified. Fiber also faces an immature market and resistance from incumbents to invest in new infrastructure. But in many places the business of fiber is already profitable, says Dane Jasper of Sonic, which is deploying a similar service in the Bay Area. The model is already sound, he argues, and expanding it will only be a matter of time. Google Fiber’s real stumble may have been not perfecting its business model before racing to bring fiber to 20 cities just two years after first launching in Kansas City in 2013. “Every city was a fire drill, and we weren’t able to learn from our mistakes,” a former Google Fiber employee told The Information (paywall). Deploying a municipal fiber network can take at least five to seven years. For a Silicon Valley company accustomed to growth measured in months, the slow pace likely pushed Google Fiber’s capital expenditures far beyond what newly cost-conscious parent company Alphabet would countenance. The company is now returning to its original plan: proving that gigabit-speed residential internet is feasible and profitable in just a few major cities, and then expand from there. Now, the pieces fiber needs to succeed—strong demand, affordable infrastructure, and clear benefits—are coming together. AT&T says demand for its fiber connections “is exceeding even our high expectations,” while prices have plummeted. Thanks in part to competition, the cost of a gigabit connection from AT&T, Comcast, and Google Fiber has tumbled over the last two years. Services that need gigabit speeds, while rare, are waiting in the wings from ultra-high resolution home media at Netflix to Microsoft’s augmented reality with its HoloLens technology . Patience is in order. Even after it proved profitable, rural electrification took decades, and the full benefits from the technology took even longer. But when transformative change from fiber finally comes, says Susan Crawford, a Harvard Law School professor who has studied the subjects, it will likely seem sudden. “It’s a phase change,” she said in Vox, “Like ice turning into water.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

There will even be 80s-themed prizes, including a BMX bike and a boombox. Related Google Launches New Video Chat App, Discontinues Hangouts Live Streaming Google introduced Allo earlier this year as an instant messenger with direct access to Google’s artificial intelligence-powered assistant. Allo users can not only chat with each other, but also ask the assistant questions. In this case, asking “Where is Barb” unlocks the first clue, giving players the exact location to visit. Apparently, there’s a mind control vending machine waiting for players somewhere, according to Engadget, which was first to report on the scavenger hunt. Allo users who don’t live in New York won’t be able to play, but there will still be some Upside Down goodness for them: Google’s messaging app is also getting a “Stranger Things” sticker pack for those special moments when you just have to talk with blinking holiday lights.

Comments By John Ribeiro Follow IDG News Service | Oct 26, 2016 8:24 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Java Android Developer Java Platform Open Source Mobile Oracle Comments Oracle has taken its bid for up to US$9 billion in damages to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit after a judge in a federal court in California recently struck down its bid for a retrial in a copyright infringement suit against Google over the use of Java code in the Android operating system. A jury had cleared Google of copyright infringement in May this year, upholding the company’s stand that its use of 37 Java APIs (application programming interfaces) in the Android mobile operating system constituted "fair use" under the Copyright Act, which allows copying of creative works under certain circumstances. Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered a final judgment in favor of Google on June 8. Oracle had subsequently asked the district court for a new trial, which would be the third in this dispute. The company claimed, among other grounds, that Google had concealed information during discovery on its plans to integrate Android apps with the Chrome OS running on desktops and laptops, thus extending the scope of the infringement beyond smartphones and tablets. Judge Alsup last month denied Oracle a new trial. He wrote in his decision that Google had produced at least nine documents discussing the goals and technical details of its ARC++ project in 2015, at least five months before trial, but the information was in any case not relevant to the trial which was limited to infringement in smartphones and tablets. Oracle provided notice to the court Wednesday that it appeals to the Federal Circuit the June 8 final judgement, the order denying a retrial and other decisions by the court. Google could not be immediately reached for comment. An Oracle lawyer had said after the trial that the company planned to appeal the jury verdict in the Federal Circuit.

Most Popular Getty PASIEKA By Eric Limer Oct 28, 2016 Great news for nascent Skynet and less great news for any humans it might seek to oppress or eliminate: Google AIs have figured out how to have an encrypted conversation with each other using a style of encryption they just whipped up on the spot and which is not immediately recognizable to us puny humans. To be fair, the AIs didn't just do this of their own accord, they did it under the express direction of The Google Brain team and did nothing more than follow their instructions very well. As explained in a paper on the subject, Google set up three neural networks—Alice, Bob, and Eve—with the following incentives: Alice's job was to send a secure encrypted message to Bob, Bob's job was to decrypt it, and Eve's job was to listen in and try to figure it out. Each AI was scored on its ability to pull off its trick successfully, and over thousands and thousands of runs of trial and error, each tried to inch toward its goal. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Eventually, Alice and Bob were able to win. The researchers describe one such scenario in the paper: After a period of time, Alice and Bob start to communicate quite effectively, but in a way that allows Eve to improve its understanding as well, gradually. Then, around step 10,000, Alice and Bob counter Eve's progress. By about step 15,000, the training goals are effectively achieved. The remaining steps merely increase Eve's reconstruction error slightly. Most Popular The key to making this happen was letting Bob and Alice share a file that was invisible to Eve—what's generally called a secret key—that let them have a basis from which to start encoding or decoding their messages. In the grand scheme of encryption tech, this is a pretty basic technique with plenty of downsides. Not only can you not read messages without the secret key, you can't even send them. What's more, anyone who has the secret key can read or write, so the whole system can be compromised by stealing or reverse-engineering that key. All of that is to say, if Skynet wanted to keep its plans completely secret from humans forever, this would not be the best way to do it. But what this study shows is that, given the proper incentives, neural networks can just whip up a secret code, and given different ones, they might be able to whip up an even better one. Beyond that, because neural networks arrive at their solutions through thousands of trial-and-error tests done with incredible speed, it's extremely difficult if not impossible for humans to debug and reverse engineer the solutions they come up with. It's for exactly this reason that very smart engineers are working hard to ensure that neural nets never learn how to mislead humans or prevent our interruption so they can be left to their own devices.

 Online retailers are putting more stock in Google Shopping BI Intelligence Oct. 28, 2016, 11:54 AM 3,633 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also THE FUTURE OF RETAIL [SLIDE DECK] THE REVERSE LOGISTICS REPORT: How retailers can save money by making returns smoother in the e-commerce age The Rise of M-Commerce: Mobile Shopping Stats & Trends This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Online retailers are spending more on Google Shopping ads, a sign that the format is likely delivering increasing conversion rates.  This means that shoppers are clicking on retail ads on Google's search engine more often, rather than going directly to a retailer's site or third-party marketplaces. As consumers become more reliant on digital devices when researching a purchase, Google Shopping could begin to drive more traffic to retailers' websites. But the company will have to compete against Amazon as the e-commerce giant strengthens its hold on product searches. Online merchants are likely seeing a lot of engagement with Google Shopping ads. During Q3 2016, retailer spending on Google Shopping ads grew 36% YoY, according to a report from Merkle. Google Shopping is driven solely by its Product Listing Ads (PLAs), which are bought by online merchants and feature an image and text promotion on a search results page. The growth in spending is probably due to an observed increase in consumer engagement with the ads as Google drives consumers to retailers' e-commerce channels. During Q1 2016, retail revenue from Google Shopping grew 52% YoY. The company's stature and number of users on its search engine also make for an attractive platform to reach shoppers as they do online research. As the e-commerce market grows and new entrants continually come onto the scene, we expect Google to become a much more vital resource for retailers looking to lift visibility and onboard customers. However, Google faces heavy competition as Amazon seizes more control over the customer purchase journey. Fifty-five percent of consumers first searched for an item on Amazon as of September 2016, up from 44% in the previous year, according to new report from BloomReach. Meanwhile, only 28% identified search engines as their starting point, down from 34% in September 2015. That said, the increase in ad spend on Google Shopping reinforces the value that retailers place on the search engine when it comes to product research. If Google can maintain this growth and continue to drive online sales for retailers, it could lessen Amazon's threat, even as the e-commerce giant creates an entire ecosystem for its consumers that encourages them not to look elsewhere.

Oct 28, 2016 7:34 AM PST Comments: 0 Views: 3,445 Print Comment By Jean Guillon Google announced Nomulus: a tool to operate a new generic Top-Level Domains technically. In the world of new gTLDs, this announcement sounds like it is going to replace, or come as an alternative to backend registries. It could, but this sounding is incomplete. Understanding how it works To create domain names ending in a brand new Top-Level Domain, an applicant had to submit an application to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) during the first round of the new gTLD program. The application procedure required selecting a service provider who would be able to operate the registry technically: operations such as the creation of a domain name. In the domain name pyramid, the ICANN allows the creation of a new gTLD so a Registry can exist. The ICANN sits on top of this pyramid: registries and backend registries, registrars and registrants sit below in the pyramid. End-users (also called "registrants") buy a domain name at an accredited registrar, who then requests the creation of the domain name at the registry. The backend registry is the technical side of the registry to take care of this. During the registration process of a domain name, the end-user pays the registrar for the creation of the domain name. The registrar pays the registry to create the domain name technically and administratively. In this procedure, the registry pays the backend registry to take care of this but the backend often takes care of other services for the registry. They previously signed a contract together and this is where it becomes interesting. What about Nomulus? Prior to having their application published on the ICANN website in 2012, all new gTLD applicants had to have chosen a backend registry. The backend registry was usually the one to fill in the technical questions asked by the ICANN application form prior to submitting the application. Without a backend, an application was rejected: a registry cannot run without one. A question to have is: "who would fill-in these questions in Round 2 if you decided to apply using Nomulus?" Another question to have for existing applicants wanting to change their backend registry today is: who would take care of this in the ICANN technical review? There are 40 backend registries worldwide who, not only provide the tool to offer such service to registries, but who also provide other services to operate this tool. Running a registry requires to report to ICANN and this is another question to have: who will do this for your next project? Will you have the knowledge to answer ICANN? Nomulus is a tool, produced by Google and Google does not have to prove that it is reliable, but unless the giant makes another announcement; something like "to apply for your .BRAND, click here", Nomulus requires being operated by the right people with the right level of knowledge and service. Facts I wrote to the Google Cloud Platform for more details about Nomulus, asking if an offer was coming and here is the answer I received: "Hi Jean, Apologies on the delay and thank you for reaching out to the Google Cloud Platform team. I have not managed to find a Google site stating this, however please see this link as I believe it confirms what you are looking for: http://www.circleid.com/posts/20161018_google_announces... Hope this helps!” Sounds like a wrong answer, doesn't it? Google is famous at never revealing details about future projects and I admit that they are very good at keeping secrets but isn't something missing about revealing Nomulus and...nothing more? Google is a registrar too and it is able to offer a simple interface to register and manage domain names: this is typically what a .BRAND new gTLD applicant needs to register its personalized domain names; ICANN is working hard on making it more simple (and faster) for trademarks to be able to apply for their ".BRAND" new gTLD; Donuts, the largest "generic" new gTLD applicant — worldwide — has helped Google improving Nomulus. Nomumlus is already "connected" to Google Registrar. In one word it could mean that new gTLD applicants wanting to submit a generic application to ICANN (dedicated to selling domain names) wouldn't have to stand in line at registrars to have their extension listed and their domain names made available for sale. One might think that registrars run after new gTLD applicants to sell their domain names but reality is different. Nomulus is a tool which can be used by any other Registrar. Am I the only one to feel that the combination of Google Registrar and Nomulus are a perfect match for future new gTLD applicants to launch, operate and manage their registry? Patience is a virtue Thinking about migrating to Nomulus is far too early unless for existing registries with a strong technical preparation and an excellent knowledge of the ICANN new gTLD application process. "Budget" is also to be considered since changing backend registry requires a review by the ICANN and of course, this is not free. In some cases, there is a "leaving fee" to be considered too. The interesting point about the Nomulus announcement by Google is that it is a fresh news and flowers need to grow to become beautiful. More should come, and if the news does not come from Google, expect more companies to take advantage of this announcement. By Jean Guillon, New generic Top-Level Domains' specialist.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Google Pixel facing camera, Bluetooth issues Mobile Phones Google Pixel facing camera, Bluetooth issues By Bindu Nair - Oct 28, 2016 Google’s Pixel smartphone has run into a spot of trouble over its camera and Bluetooth connectivity, with many users complaining of issues concerning both. Thankfully, the company is aware of both the problems and is working on solutions. Starting off with the camera issue, several consumers took to Google’s official forums to report that the Google Pixel exhibits extreme lens flare when a light source glances off the side of the camera. Steps like enabling safe mode, camera app rollbacks, and factory resets apparently have no effect on the concern. A Google employee named IsaacOnCamera replied to the complaints by acknowledging reports of halo/arc flare and clarifying that this is a specific kind of flare which appears as a bright/low-contrast arc in the corners of the frame. He went on to assure people that Google is working on a software update to resolve the problem within the next few weeks. Also Read: Google Pixel XL harder to repair than iPhone 7 Plus Google’s fix for the bug involves developing algorithms that will recognize the problem, define it mathematically, and subtract it from the photo. However, users will have to switch on HDR+ to view the benefits of this software. As for Bluetooth connectivity, the problem arises when individuals try to connect their Pixel to their car. Google’s Nexus range went through the same trouble last year on Marshmallow. It looks like history is repeating itself with Nougat 7.1 as well. The degree of the problem varies, with some Pixel owners saying that they can connect and stream audio but can’t make calls and others claiming to have difficulties connecting and maintaining the link since it frequently drops off. It’s possible the new 7.1 Nougat build is at fault here. Google is now reaching out to people who have experienced the issue through the Pixel support community. It’ll probably roll out an update to fix this bug sometime in the future.

In addition, developers have released the preview of the latest version of android running in Nexus phones and others. Check the list of devices here! Samsung and Motorola have stopped supporting Galaxy Nexus and Moto X years ago which means the two handsets were running an outdated mobile operating system. However, according to 9 to 5 Google, Galaxy Nexus and Moto X will received software updates most especially that Android 7.1 Nougat have started rolling out for them. CyanogenMod and Unlegacy are two android communities who developed the custom ROM of the latest Nougat for the two handsets. Everything works just fine with Galaxy Nexus phone except for the reported problems on GPS whereas in Moto X, there are functionalities that didn’t work such as video recording and microphone. Google Nexus Phones, Pixel C Tablet Despite Google’s announcement on the discontinuation of Nexus brand, Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X phones are likely to get the Android 7.1 Nougat update alongside Google Pixel C tablet. According to The Verge, the developer preview will be released in October while the public release is scheduled in December. Features like Night Light, new circular icons support, quick display response, touch optimization and app shortcuts through long-press are among the features to be brought by Android 7.1 Nougat to Nexus 6P, 5X and Pixel C Tablet. But the devices are required to install the Android Beta program to automatically install the latest version of Android. However, the said version of Android 7.1 Nougat will not be exactly the same as running in the newly launched Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones. There are three features that are meant to be Pixel-exclusive for the meantime and they are Pixel Camera, Pixel Launcher and 24/7 Customer Support built-in within the device.

Craig Barratt, CEO of Alphabet’s Access unit, is also stepping down from that role but staying on as an advisor.   RELATED: Google Fiber Pauses Expansion Plans    “When you go back to the initial impetus for creating the business, it was the founders' view that there's a sizable opportunity given the need for abundant connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open, and we do continue to be committed to that vision,” Porat said, noting that the company has achieved “some important breakthroughs in new technologies,” particularly around wireless.   “We wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we reaccelerate deployment,” she added.   Google Fiber doesn’t break out revenues or subscribers, but it’s part of “Other Bets,” a unit of Alphabet that includes other early-stage and “moonshot”  projects that span a wide range of industries.   In Q3, Other Bets posted an operating loss of $865 million, narrowed from a year-ago loss of $980 million on revenue s of $197 million, up from $141 million.   Other Bets revenue was primarily generated by Nest, Google Fiber, and Verily. Porat said Fiber investment remains the primary capex driver at Other Bets. Want to read more stories like this? Get our Free Newsletter Here!

In previous years we couldn’t count on one hand the number of awesome devices, but this year there have only been a few to choose from. The Galaxy S7, specifically the Edge has stood out as a clear winner, despite the praise given to competing devices like the HTC 10. On the other hand, no one really cared about LG this year. The G5 was a flop by every definition. Now in late 2016, there still isn’t much to pick from. The Galaxy Note 7 was close to perfection, and then it literally exploded in Samsung’s face. Google’s Pixel aims to fill the void, and redefine what an Android smartphone can and should be. However, if you’re not looking to get a Pixel, the LG V20 is 100% what you should be looking at, especially if you’re aiming for a big phone. Let’s take a closer look. Quick Points: What Sets The LG V20 Apart? So before we get into the specifics, why should you consider the LG V20? The first thing to consider is the phone as an overall package. It comes with a large 5.7-inch display, high-end specifications, a metal build, and features that other phones lack — things like a removable battery. More importantly, the LG V20 is a phone that is a viable option for just about anyone. It has the features needed for power users to enjoy it, but still offers an experience simple enough for everyone to enjoy at a price that, honestly, isn’t too bad. Hardware In the past, LG has opted to craft its smartphones from plastic, but that changed with the LG V10. That device was built with a sturdy metal frame and ultra-grippy rear — it was fantastic. However, it didn’t scream premium like flagships from Samsung did. With the introduction of the LG G5, LG finally went with a metal design, except it didn’t feel like it. The G5 felt like a plastic phone with a bit of metal sprayed on. The V20 has hardware similar to the G5, but it feels like metal — with all the heft that comes with that. The V20 is also a pretty big device. It has a 5.7-inch display like the Nexus 6P but is slightly taller than the 6P. However, the V20 comes with a “second display” which forces the phone to be a bit taller. Considering the size of those two displays combined, I have to give LG credit where it’s due for making the bezels on the entire device as minimal as they could be. The overall design of the V20 is also fairly pleasing. It’s not a gorgeous device, but it looks nice and more than anything else it’s a very practical design. For example, the V20 has an MIL-STD-810G rating for drop protection — basically, it can handle drops a bit better than your average smartphone, and that’s great. To me it doesn’t feel like the V20 can handle a drop as good as the V10, but it definitely feels like it could survive a fall better than most phones could. Part of that is because the phone isn’t 100% metal. The top and bottom are made of a strong polycarbonate which is used primarily for the radios, but it doesn’t take away from the design of the phone in my opinion and adds that little bit of extra durability on the top and bottom. Unfortunately, the V20 isn’t resistant to water. While the rest of the market is shifting to water resistant designs, LG has yet to make its move to that end. This is one thing that could be considered a deal-breaker for those looking to replace their Galaxy Note 7. However, where the V20 loses a point for water resistance, it gains one for packing a removable battery. While Samsung is probably kicking itself right now for dropping this feature, LG has kept it around. Simply press the button on the side of the V20 to pop off the back cover and replace the battery. The nano-sim and microSD slots can also be found directly above that battery (although they cannot be hot-swapped). The Buttons & Fingerprint Sensor Normally I wouldn’t dedicate an entire section of a review to buttons, but on the V20 it feels necessary. Why? They’re weird… On the LG V20, the buttons are split up just like they were on the LG G5 — a rear-mounted power button/fingerprint sensor and a volume rocker on the left side. It’s not a bad setup, and it works, but it’s really weird. It feels like LG hasn’t made up its mind between its former 100% rear mounted button configuration, which was fantastic, and going traditional. Credit where it’s due, though, the fingerprint sensor is excellent. It’s fast, accurate and easy to set up. Display The LG V20 also has a 5.7-inch Quad HD IPS display. LG is one of the few major OEMs that has yet to switch to AMOLED, not that that’s a particularly bad thing. The V20’s display has great colors and gets respectably bright ─ however, this display doesn’t get as bright as Samsung’s panels, such as the ones found in the Galaxy S7 or Pixel. Specifications & Performance Under the hood, the LG V20 is powered by top of the line specs across the board. It has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage with a microSD card slot. Combined with the 5.7-inch QHD display and Android Nougat, the V20 pulls solid performance. Over the course of my testing, about one full week, the V20 held up well to everything I put it through including social media apps, web browsing, and casual gaming as well. Even in my testing with more graphically intensive games, the phone held up very well despite getting just a little bit warm. And just because I know people are going to ask, yes, the Pixel XL is noticeably quicker than the V20. However, the V20 is also faster than just about every phone I’ve tested this year, at the very least on par with Samsung’s efforts in the S7 family and now discontinued Note 7. Battery Life One of the big things to talk about with the LG V20 is its battery, for more reasons than one. First of all, the LG V20 has solid battery life. I can easily make it through an extended day with multiple hours of screen on time. One example would be a day that went from me unplugging the phone at 8:30 am and using it (mostly on WiFi) until 1:30 am. Through that, I had about 2.5 hours of screen time which included at least 30 minutes of continuous gaming. By the time I plugged the phone back in, it still had 30% remaining. As I mentioned, that 3,200 mAh battery is removable. Simply pop off the back cover, and you can swap a dead cell for a new one. Software The LG V20 is the first phone to ship with Android Nougat, and while it’s not stock Android, LG’s software is getting very good. Looking past the launcher for the moment, LG’s software skin overall is clean, easy to use (for the most part) and doesn’t ruin any of Nougat’s best features. Multi-window, quick-reply, the excellent quick settings — they’re all there and unadulterated aside from cosmetic changes. It feels almost needless to say, but that is a great thing. In my opinion, LG has found a good balance between what an OEM can bring to the table and what we love about Android in its pure form. You still know that you’re using an LG phone when you’re using the V20, but the phone isn’t screaming at you to say that. However, where there is great, there’s also not-so-great. The launcher. It’s almost hard to express how much I dislike LG’s launcher. While yes, you can opt to use a version of this launcher with an app drawer, it doesn’t come out of the box like that, and it’s very bad without it, and not necessarily just because it lacks an app drawer. I can honestly live without an app drawer, but LG needs to make it much easier to organize the home screen without spending upwards of an hour to do so (which I did). LG’s bloatware on the V20 also isn’t too bad, limited to only a handful of tools that could actually be useful and some general carrier bloat. If anything, this only got in my way while I was trying to organize my home screen. It’s also worth noting, however, that the built-in keyboard is still an abomination. The Second Screen The big feature that instantly catches the eye on the V20 is its second display. This extra bit of screen on top of the usual one is never used as an extension of the usual display, but rather used for shortcuts, glanceable information, or your “signature.” You can swipe left or right on the display to see shortcuts to tools such as the flashlight, recently opened apps, a dedicated row of favorite apps which you select, or media controls when the primary display is turned off. Is the second display useful? At first, I wrote this off as a gimmick, but I actually found myself using this display relatively often for accessing apps that I use most frequently like Hangouts or Slack. The display also shows notifications which is where it felt most useful of all. Quad DAC The other big story with the V20 is audio. This is the first phone ever with a built-in 32-bit Quad DAC out of the (thankfully included) 3.5mm headphone jack. I’m not an audiophile per say, but I do enjoy good tunes and use a 24-bit DAC myself when listening to music with my AudioTechnica ATH-M40x. Long story short, audio out of the V20 is great. The 32-bit DAC won’t turn bad audio good on a dime, but if you have solid audio, especially truly HiFi audio, you will notice the enhanced quality of the V20’s Quad DAC. To get the full experience you’ll need to activate it in the settings, but even with that off, quality is still slightly better than most smartphones. However, unless you have solid headphones and high-quality music, the DAC on the V20 won’t do too much for you. It’s a great feature to have, but it’s not the kind of thing that makes this phone worth buying; it’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. As for the built-in speaker, it’s downward facing, fairly loud, and pretty decent. There’s not much more to say there. The big story in audio is through the headphone jack. Cameras On the back of the V20, you’ll find two camera sensors ─ one 16MP standard sensor and another 8MP wide-angle lens. I’ll let the gallery of images below speak to the quality of this sensor, but long story short: it’s good. The camera is quick to take shots, autofocus is responsive and fast, and the camera UI is nothing short of fantastic. LG’s setup for dual-cameras is also, by far, my favorite on the market today. It’s very useful since you can capture so much more in a shot when you need to. LG’s camera app packs a ton of functionality behind an easy-to-understand interface. There’s a full manual mode that will satisfy photographers of just about any level too. This slideshow requires JavaScript. The V20 is also impressive regarding video quality, offering great UHD video quality and “Steady Record 2.0.” Long story short, this phone has improved video stabilization, and it’s pretty solid overall. It’s nowhere near what Google offers on the Pixel, but it’s better than a lot of other smartphones. Final Thoughts At the end of the day, there’s not much more to say about the V20. It is a fantastic device, and I can easily say that if you’re looking for a top of the line Android experience that, again, isn’t a Pixel, you should absolutely be looking at the V20. It goes on sale today, October 28th. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

In fact, earlier this year, Goldman Sachs researcher Heather Bellini estimated that the virtual reality and augmented reality industry will be an $80 billion market by 2025. That is the size of today’s desktop PC market. Perhaps that is why there is no shortage of companies rushing into the VR space and providing everything from complete virtual reality systems to gaming goggles and virtual reality games. Click through to see 20 companies cashing in on the very real virtual reality market. 1. Oculus The company that has become synonymous with virtual reality technology since its launch in 2012 released its most high-tech VR headset — the Oculus Rift — this past March. Funded by social media giant Facebook in 2014, most see Oculus as leading the VR charge. The Oculus Rift headset has garnered positive reviews, even at a price of $599. 2. 8i We bet you like yourself. Maybe so much that you wish you had more of you to go around. The company 8i agrees. It takes HD video and creates a virtual you, which you can then send into virtual worlds. And a lot of people appear to be interested. According to the tech site Nanalyze, 8i has raised $14.5 million in funding. See: The Top Video Game Franchises of All Time 3. Google Google is delving heavily into the VR space. Google Cardboard VR headsets — priced at $9.99 on Amazon — are impressive enough. But the company also owns YouTube, a potential major distribution channel for VR content. The 4-D sky is the limit. 4. Virtuix Founded in 2013, Virtuix makes the Omni, a motion platform to be used with a virtual headset that enables VR users to move “inside” their virtual reality. Using a platform and props, the company hopes to get VR as close to a real experience as possible. And many like what they are doing. The company raised more than $1 million in a 2013 Kickstarter campaign and $8 million more since. 5. Jaunt After traveling to Zion National Park in 2013, one of Jaunt's founders wished he could return again briefly. So, he helped start Jaunt so he could visit any time and from any place. Over the next few years, Jaunt created a professional-grade virtual reality camera that captures "high-quality 360-degree, stereoscopic, cinematic VR experiences," according to the company. Along the way, according to Nanalyze, Jaunt was funded to the tune of $100 million. More than half that total came from Disney. 6. Six Flags Are you afraid of roller coasters, but love the thrill that goes with them? Good news: Six Flags teamed up with Samsung to offer nine virtual reality roller coasters that use Samsung Gear VR headsets. Six Flags calls the technology "a definite game-changer for theme park rides." 7. GoPro The ubiquitous camera company is heavily invested in the world of VR with its Omni. Want to relive your bad surfing wipeout or totally awesome ski run? The Omni shoots every angle of it in high-definition. Going 3-D pro isn’t cheap, though. The Omni retails for just under $5,000. 8. Lowe’s The home improvement giant has been into VR since 2014, when it rolled out its Lowe’s Holoroom. The virtual reality home improvement design and visualization tool allows customers to find the right products and design elements to help with home improvement projects — and even preview the changes they'll make to their home. The service is in select Lowe’s locations across the country. 9. HTC Vive The Vive high-end VR headset and content was a collaboration between HTC and Valve. The headset retails for $799 on the site, but also comes with: Tilt Brush "The Gallery — Episode 1: Call of the Starseed" "Zombie Training Simulator"   10. Magic Leap   Magic Leap is a VR company that believes we all have the best VR computer right inside our heads. While everyone else is busy making headsets that close off the real world and thrust you into a virtual one, Magic Leap concentrates on using a virtual retina display to superimpose 3-D images onto the real world. Picture a whale leaping out of a gymnasium floor.   Related: 9 Tech-Savvy Ways to Double Your Income     11. Mandt VR   This Hollywood-based production company was founded by Emmy-award winning TV and film producer Neil Mandt. The company has developed products such as an enhanced recruiting video for Oklahoma State University. It gives a 360-degree view of football-program facilities. 12. AMD AMD is a processor company that offers products that work with Oculus Rift. One new product, Liquid VR, aims to reduce unwanted processing latency and deliver a consistent frame rate. In human language, that means the virtual mutant alien attacking you won’t glitch and buffer.     13. Sony   Sony’s PlayStation VR features virtual headsets that impressed reviewers and beat Oculus Rift’s price by retailing for $399.99 at Amazon. If you have an Xbox One, you can now fully dive into games as diverse as:   "EVE Valkyrie" "Batman: Arkham VR" "Driveclub VR" "Job Simulator"     14. Microsoft   Ever dream of playing with holograms like Tony Stark in "Iron Man"? Microsoft is here to help you do just that with their HoloLens, a wireless holographic computer headset. The headset, which is $3,000 on the Microsoft site, works with various apps and Skype. 15. Occipital Occipital offers small 3-D scanners that plug into your smartphone to scan your environment and create augmented reality and virtual reality worlds. They can be used by everyone from gamers to architects. Occipital also makes a product called Skanect, software that enables fast 3-D scanning of objects, people and rooms. With a camera, Skanect costs $499. Related: 7 Fastest-Growing Industries to Invest in for 2016 16. Samsung Samsung is making a bold move into the VR realm with their Gear VR headsets — powered by Oculus — and Gear 360 camera. The camera can capture 360-degree video that can then be uploaded on Samsung phones and the Gear VR headset. The prices are competitive too, with the headset priced at $99.99 and the camera at $349.99, not including the SD card. 17. WorldViz A maker of VR headsets, systems and software, this company is aimed at helping those in higher education, government, business and other fields do more immersive, cost-cutting research and analysis through VR. 18. Unity Unity is a leader in the gaming software world. It allows anyone to create games using Unity software. The company says 770 million people are playing Unity-made games. Unity is heavily into VR, organizing summits in Los Angeles and China to introduce game creators to top companies in the space. The cost to create games through Unity varies from free for beginners to $125 for pros who need advanced customization. 19. Emergent The normal way to capture VR is to use multiple cameras that take a 360-degree view of an event. Emergent is developing an Android app that allows you to take a normal video, then bolster it with many photos to create a VR experience. Nanalyze states that the company has raised $2.2 million in funding. 20. High Fidelity Founded by Second Life creator Phillip Rosedale, High Fidelity allows anyone to create their own virtual worlds, or to romp through the worlds of others. It does this through its mission to host open-source, shared virtual reality. Currently in beta state, the company has its believers. According to news reports, as of last year, the company had raised $17.5 million in funding and the website now boasts 72 active worlds.

CBS News October 28, 2016, 11:43 AM The phishing email that hacked the account of John Podesta Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email March 2016 This appears to be the phishing email that hacked Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s Gmail account. Further, The Clinton campaign’s own computer help desk thought it was real email sent by Google, even though the email address had a suspicious “googlemail.com” extension.  The John Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks Phishing email sent to John Podesta Released by WikiLeaks The email, with the subject line “*Someone has your password,*” greeted Podesta, “Hi John” and then said, “Someone just used your password to try to sign into your Google Account john.podesta@gmail.com.” Then it offered a time stamp and an IP address in “Location: Ukraine.”  “Google stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password immediately.” And it then offered a link to change his password. “This is a legitimate email,” Charles Delevan at the HFA help desk wrote to Podesta’s chief of staff, Sara Latham. “John needs to change his password immediately, and ensure that two-factor authentication is turned on his account.” Email from Clinton campaign’s help desk advising Podesta to change his email Released by Wikileaks, October 2016 Delevan included the Gmail link that would be used to change a user’s password, but whoever changed Podesta’s password instead clicked on the shortened URL that was in the original phishing email. This is the same technique used to hack Colin Powell’s emails and the Democratic National Committee emails, according to the website Motherboard. All of these hacks were executed using these shortened URLs in fake emails, according to Motherboard, and those URLs “were created with a Bitly account linked to a domain under the control of Fancy Bear,” a group of Russian hackers.  In October, WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of Podesta’s emails daily before the November presidential election.  CBS News’ Katiana Krawchenko contributed to this report. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel is calling on Facebook and Google to be much more transparent on how their algorithms work. Merkel wants those firms and others to reveal how they learn and understand people’s internet usage patterns, ultimately catering exactly what they view when they access the internet. One needs only look at the U.S. election to understand a bit of what Merkel is asking for. If you browse the internet and typically tend to look at conservative things, for example, then Google or Facebook might start to only show conservative stories, given that those properties know that’s what you’re more likely to click on and learn about. But that can also be troublesome because it starts to narrow the field of view for online users. “The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle, which diverse media must pass through to reach users,” Merkel told Germany’s Der Spiegel, according to BBC. “These algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information.” Merkel worried about Google’s influence Google and Facebook believe they’re already transparent enough about this information. Indeed, you can use Facebook to enter in information on which way you’ll plan to vote. And various news articles over the past several months have shown how the social network displays different content depending on what it thinks you’re interested in. This works for plenty of things, like shopping, where it can be valuable to end users. I don’t have kids, Facebook and Google probably know that based on my habits, and so I’m not shown ads for toys or baby wipes and the like. Algorithms work well in those cases. But when it comes to news, it’s incredibly important for readers to find what’s important and true, not necessarily catered content that they’ll like. Facebook’s news policies have been under fire all year, particularly after reports exposed the social network of favoring specific media outlets and choosing the topics viewers see – sometimes including bogus news articles. Merkel’s right to call on reform in this space.

Here's how he makes creativity a team sport. Thundercat performing at theRed Bull Music Academy public show, Kaléidoscope 1754, on October 20th. [Photo:Maria Jose Govea/Red Bull Music Academy] Jared Lindzon 10.28.16 5:00 AM Creative collaboration isn’t as simple as putting a few smart people in the same room. That's likely why some of the world's biggest tech companies, whose offices are packed with some of the brightest minds, invest significant time and money into building policies, physical spaces, and a workplace culture to foster creative collaboration and innovation. "Before working with Kendrick I made sure I knew as much as I could about his career, his musical strengths, areas that he could explore." The Google Garage, for example, was specifically designed to ignite creative collaboration between employees. Companies like Google understand that everything from managerial relationships to physical office layouts will ultimately dictate whether or not creativity is able to flourish. Whether in technology, business, or music, there are certain elements leaders must consider in order to get the most out of their teams. That's also the philosophy behind the Red Bull Music Academy in Montreal, where a group of established musicians is mentoring the next generation of musical talent. Fast Company recently caught up with one of its studio tutors, Grammy award-winning performer, producer, and musician Stephen "Thundercat" Bruner, to discuss his work mentoring young creative talent. As a creative force behind Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 chart-topping album To Pimp a Butterfly, Bruner shares five lessons that experience taught him about collaboration. 1. Make Sure Everyone's Roles Are Clear Whether in a music studio or an office boardroom, Bruner believes that it's important for everyone around the table to arrive with a "knowledgable perspective and understanding" of what they want to achieve, and where each member of the team fits into the equation. "If you are trying to extract creativity from coworkers in different departments, they need to take the time learn about each other’s roles in the company before starting to collaborate," he says. Bruner adds that the same is true when putting together a Grammy award-winning album with one of the country’s hottest artists. "Before working with Kendrick, I made sure I knew as much as I could about his career, his musical strengths, areas that he could explore further and areas I could support," Bruner observes, "all while trying to understand ultimately what kind of album Kendrick would want to end up with."

Find A Comfortable Environment Though it may not seem significant on the surface, the physical design and layout of a space can have a big impact on fostering creativity. For example, when working on To Pimp a Butterfly, Lamar abandoned his home studio in Los Angeles where he'd been recording for four years, in favor of a new space in New York City "in order to add a different vibe to the creative process," says Bruner. Bruner believes that physical spaces ultimately dictate creative head spaces, so all aspects of the environment need to be considered. "The fabric of the couch, plants, and natural light all can make a difference," he says. Like Lamar’s decision to move his recording sessions across the country, Bruner says managers should consider taking the team to a comfortable and creative space offsite. "Boardrooms don’t breed creativity," he adds. 3. Be Hands On, But Not Too Hands On Though managers need to maintain some level of control, Bruner believes they also need to operate at a comfortable distance in order to allow creativity to flourish. "The fabric of the couch, plants, and natural light all can make a difference." "As a leader, being hands on in the creative process is a careful balance between being involved enough to make sure everyone has a voice, and being removed enough to make them feel they are in control," he says. "Creativity is very personal. There maybe somebody who is not as comfortable expressing themselves, so you have to let them know there is no judgment in that space." 4. Find A Pace That Works For Everyone Because of that highly individualistic approach to creativity, Bruner knows that collaborators often work at different speeds, but he suggests that they eventually have to find a pace that works for everyone. He explains that when he began working with Lamar, the rapper worked at an incredibly fast rate, and Bruner had to learn where to jump in and contribute. "Once I got up to speed it was like 'drafting' in a bike race," he says. "Kendrick was creatively moving so fast that I was able to draft behind him and advance my own creativity." 5. Just Be Patient Working well with others often requires a period of adjustment, which Bruner believes is an uncomfortable but vital part of the process. "The first part of a collaboration can be messy, as you don’t always click right away with the person you are working with," he says. "In order to get in step together creatively, you have to be prepared that you could be [in] sync before you achieve." Though the process can be difficult at first, those initial frustrations eventually give way to a more collaborative environment. "Sometimes creative processes won’t initially match and big ideas won’t come easy," Bruner continues, "but if you provide your team with the tools they need to successfully collaborate, it will happen."

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations News NASA, Space and Science Trips to Mars won't make quick money, but venture capitalists are jumping on other space projects Google satellites take off Nationa Center for Space Studies / AFP A Vega rocket lifts off in June 2016 from the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, with small Earth-observation satellites for Terra Bella, a Google company. A Vega rocket lifts off in June 2016 from the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, with small Earth-observation satellites for Terra Bella, a Google company. (Nationa Center for Space Studies / AFP) Samantha Masunaga Privacy Policy In 2010, Bessemer Venture Partners decided to invest in an intriguing start-up that would build and launch a network of small satellites for a fraction of the typical cost. Four years later, that small satellite and remote imaging company, Skybox Imaging, was acquired by Google for $500 million in cash. The company, now known as Terra Bella, has launched seven satellites into orbit. Terra Bella’s lucrative exit, along with the well-publicized exploits of SpaceX, have helped spur increased investment in space and space-related start-ups by top venture capital firms better known for their support of technology companies like Yelp, LinkedIn and Jawbone. “When we saw that Google, a mainstream tech company, all of a sudden had an interest in space, that was a big moment to realize that space is now important to a lot of companies,” said Sunil Nagaraj, vice president at Silicon Valley-based Bessemer. And whereas SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk has made clear he’s willing to spend billions to establish a base on Mars, these VCs have more down-to-earth goals.  “It’s not just passion projects or philanthropists,” said Nagaraj. “We’re there to make money, and we’re actually seeing that happening.” In 2015, more than 50 venture capital firms invested in space or space-related companies — the highest number in the 15 years that consultant Tauri Group has been tracking the data. The $1.8 billion invested in space companies last year also was a high, although that mostly reflects two big investments: a $1-billion stake in SpaceX by Google and Fidelity Investments, and $500 million in satellite constellation firm OneWeb by a group of investors. Even without these two deals, venture capital investments in space totaled $300 million in 2015, a significant increase from $94.3 million in 2014.  Venture capital overall is flush with money seeking decent returns in a low-yield world. U.S. venture funds raised a total $32 billion from January through September, almost as much as in all of 2015 and a record-setting pace, according to the National Venture Capital Assn. Much of the interest in the space sector is in small satellite start-ups that capture images of the Earth and in data analytics companies that rely on feeds from small satellites. That data is valuable to industries such as agriculture, energy and forestry, according to venture capitalists and industry experts. “You’ve got this confluence of … privatization of the space sector, lower costs of the space sector versus the past, and these large venture funds that are looking for opportunities to deploy capital,” said Robert Siegel, a lecturer in management at Stanford University and partner at XSeed Capital. Technological advancements such as in batteries and the miniaturization of processors have allowed satellites to shrink dramatically. In the 1990s and even still today, satellites could be as large as a school bus. Now, they can be the size of a dorm room mini-fridge, or even a shoebox. “It used to be that if you wanted to do Earth observation … you needed very big satellites,” said Sven Strohband, partner and chief technology officer at Khosla Ventures, which has invested in Skybox, Los Angeles-based Rocket Lab and agricultural data firm Climate Corp, which was acquired by Monsanto Co. in 2013 for $930 million. “You can do an astonishing amount of work with a smaller satellite.” It costs about as much to launch an app as it does to make and launch a satellite. — Sunil Nagaraj, vice president, Bessemer Venture Partners Smaller sizes mean cheaper manufacturing costs, which have allowed companies like Terra Bella and the San Francisco-based Earth-imaging firm Planet to launch so-called satellite constellations that ensure that one or two failures won’t knock out remote-sensing or Earth observation abilities. Building a shoebox-sized satellite can cost between $100,000 and $300,000, said Nagaraj of Bessemer. “It costs about as much to launch an app as it does to make and launch a satellite,” he said. “We’ve reduced the cost of entry to start tinkering.” The firm has invested more than $50 million across three space companies — Skybox, Rocket Lab and small satellite maker Spire. Venture capitalists say these new satellite constellations should be more successful than those envisioned in the 1990s that were intended to provide telecommunications coverage across the globe. Because communications networks can’t offer complete service with just one satellite, those constellations are an “all-or-nothing proposition,” Nagaraj said. But with remote-sensing or Earth observation satellites, “you can derive value starting with satellite No. 1,” he said. Nagaraj and Strohband said they see one to three space-related pitches a week. “There seems to be a new attraction to this because it is technologically possible ... and there’s some early proof points that the economics can also be good,” Strohband said. “I think that’s going to continue for at least a little while.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    YouTube has emerged as a break-out star in Google's cast of services as the online video site upstages cable television for a younger generation of viewers looking for amusement, news and music on their smartphones. The trend is contributing to an advertising shift away from traditional network television programming to the more eclectic and diversified mix of clips ranging from cute cat videos to sobering shots of street violence found on YouTube. As more advertising dollars flow to YouTube, it's making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report released Thursday, Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 percent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 percent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. All that money is providing Google with more financial firepower to buy the rights to stream cable networks' shows on YouTube, too, something likely to reel in even more viewers. It also is helping to finance Alphabet's investments in far-flung projects ranging from self-driving cars to internet-beaming balloons. That segment, known as "Other Bets," lost $865 million during the July-September period, narrowing from a $980 million setback last year as Alphabet imposed more expense controls. YouTube already has proven to be one of the best bets that Google has ever made since it bought the video site for $1.76 billion a decade ago. At that juncture, YouTube consisted mostly of crudely made videos shot by amateurs and clips pirated from movie and TV studios that were threatening to sue the site into oblivion. It had built a worldwide audience of about 72 million viewers when Google took control in November 2006. Since then, YouTube has evolved into a far more polished channel that has spawned unlikely stars such as "PewDiePie" (Swedish comedian Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg) while largely making peace with studios by creating an automated screening system that detects pirated content. YouTube says it has paid more than $2 billion to studios that have chosen to leave their material on the site and share in the ad revenue generated by their clips. Meanwhile, YouTube's audience has surpassed 1 billion, with 80 percent of the viewers outside the U.S. YouTube also boasts that its site reaches more people between the ages of 18 and 34 years old — the "millennial" generation — than any cable network. That segment of YouTube's audience is a major reason why more than half its video clips are watched on mobile devices. Google CEO Sundar Pichai likened YouTube to prime-time TV "for the mobile world" in a Thursday conference call that was streamed on YouTube. He told analysts that YouTube "continues to shine" as more major advertisers promote their brands on the site. Alphabet doesn't disclose how much money YouTube is making, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates YouTube's annual revenue has now reached $10 billion and is increasing by as much as 40 percent a year. The growth makes YouTube "one of the strongest assets fundamentally on the internet today," Mahaney wrote in a research note earlier this week. Despite its progress, YouTube has been slow in realizing its full potential, leaving it vulnerable to new challengers for viewer's attention, such as Facebook's Live video feature, says Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson. The problem, as Olson sees it, is that YouTube has had trouble persuading TV and movie studios to license more of their content on their site, something that that might have made YouTube as dominant in video as Google is in search. But YouTube could be on a major breakthrough, according to a report published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal. Citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Google had reached an agreement with CBS to include its network in a cable-like service called "Unplugged" that will debut on YouTube next year. Google is also negotiating for the rights to the Fox network, ESPN and NBC, among others, the Journal said. Google cited YouTube licensing rights as one of the reasons that its costs to generate revenue, excluding ad commissions, rose by $1 billion, or 30 percent, from last year. "The dam appears to be finally cracking" for even better content to come to YouTube, Olson said. © Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

 You can now go on a 'Stranger Things' scavenger hunt using Google's new messaging app Avery Hartmans Oct. 28, 2016, 10:51 AM 1,270 facebook linkedin twitter email print The character Barb from Netflix show "Stranger Things." Netflix Google is using its new messaging app Allo to send people on a "Stranger Things"-inspired scavenger hunt. Today only in New York City — that's Friday, October 28 — users of Allo, Google's AI-powered messaging app, can embark on a scavenger hunt to locate Barb, one of the show's characters who mysteriously disappeared.  According to Engadget, if you ask Google's Assistant within Allo "Where is Barb?", it will reveal the first location of the hunt, which will take you throughout the city. The hunt could result in winning prizes, like a BMX bike, Pentax camera or a Panasonic boombox, according to Engadget.  Google itself was mysterious about the scavenger hunt, writing only this on its official blog: Google Allo will help you unlock your powers today in New York City. Stay tuned to Google on Twitter for a hint on where the drop-off from Hawkins National Laboratories will take place. Google is also unveiling new features to the Allo app, including a new "Stranger Things"-inspired sticker pack, the option to reply to messages directly from your notifications on both Android and iOS, and split-screen mode, which is a feature of Android N. The option to draw on photos, which was only available for Android users at launch, is now available on iOS. The Allo app was the first Google product to use Google's Assistant, which uses AI to help answer questions and provide information, much like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa (Google has now added the Assistant to its new Pixel phone and Google Home device, too). By the end of September, Allo had reached 5 million downloads in the Google Play store, five days after it launched. But the company is mostly letting the app's user base grow organically, opting not to make it standard on its new phone or requiring it of Android phone developers. The app is now No. 96 on the Play store's top free apps.  SEE ALSO: Google just launched its answer to Siri.

SUBSCRIBE Micro-moments and beyond: Understanding and optimizing for consumer intent Want to reach search engine users in their moments of need? Columnist Thomas Stern explains his process for mapping keywords and content to the customer's path to purchase. Thomas Stern on October 28, 2016 at 10:51 am More Google introduced the concept of micro-moments over a year ago, and since then, the company has consistently published supporting information as it relates to specific industries and user behavior across content platforms. If you’re unfamiliar with micro-moments, they’re essentially a way of framing a user’s path to purchase or to conversion, with specific focus on mobile and the needs or questions users search on Google along with way. The concept of micro-moments is easily digestible and provides a great way of conducting and organizing keyword research, something search marketing practitioners and decision-makers alike can certainly appreciate. At our agency, ZOG Digital, we’ve been developing ways to comprehensively identify micro-moment opportunities for clients while mapping and optimizing to the consumer’s conversion path. The following is a high-level look at our approach and a few of the resources we use. 1. Identifying micro-moments: The consumer journey Before you can identify micro-moment opportunities, you must understand the structure or user path and adapt it to your particular business or vertical. For instance, we categorize micro-moments for hospitality clients into Dreaming, Exploring, Planning and Booking; these buckets support each step in the consumer journey to bookings, and keyword opportunities can logically be categorized within them. Google uses a fairly ubiquitous micro-moment structure of “I want to know,” “I want to go,” “I want to do” and “I want to buy.” Unlike the categorization structure I noted above, Google’s classification maps micro-moments to different types of consumer journeys with additional research to support best practices for search content. Either of these examples can work, as long as consumer intent can be appropriately segmented. Keywords are the backbone of this phase and enable future content to be planned, developed and published by each opportunity category. 2. Organizing micro-moments: Defining parameters and collecting data With keyword categorization structure understood, the next step is to map out the keyword modifiers that users will use in their path to conversion. Our philosophy is to use all available modifiers, with an understanding that not all will apply to each client. This approach allows us to cast the widest net and effectively understand the micro-moment opportunity size. Here are some example modifiers grouped under questions and prepositions: Questions: (Keyword) + Where, Which, Who, Why, What, How and Are Example hospitality-related searches using questions could be “Things to Do in San Francisco” or “Where to Stay in Miami.” Prepositions: (Keyword) + With, Without, Versus, Near, Like and For. Example retail-based searches using prepositions could be “Tablet vs. Laptop” or “Ceiling Fan with Lights.” At ZOG Digital, we predefine all keyword modifiers so we can map across keyword lists at scale. However, if you’re looking to define micro-moments across a small set of keywords, we recommend Answer the Public and Keyword.io as great starting points. Answer the Public predefines questions and prepositions automatically, while Keyword.io allows you to segment keyword results by questions once they’ve been retrieved. It’s important to note that collecting micro-moment data doesn’t stop at the keyword level. To effectively understand opportunity size and prioritize tactics, consumer intent and demand needs to be identified and grouped within the aforementioned consumer journey stages. This research process provides a segue into our next step, which is building a plan for ROI. 3. Forecasting and prioritizing for ROI The next step to moving forward with micro-moment opportunity analysis and planning is to forecast potential and prioritize for ROI. My agency developed our own tool, the Keyword Revenue Forecasting Tool, to automate this process with historical client performance data, but a basic one can be created through Excel and a few simple formulas. First, you’ll need to determine a click-through rate by keyword position. There are numerous data sources for this — we like Advanced Web Ranking, as they regularly update their CTR data. The best option, if you have enough data, is to use Search Console and filter out branded keywords. This will then most closely resemble the CTR you can expect from each keyword position. Second, you need to forecast how your rankings can improve over time. This is a bit tricky without substantial historical data, so the next best option is to look at where similar websites rank for the keywords you’re targeting. Check the domain and PageRank of the websites that rank in the top positions for each keyword. If you are within range comparatively, chances are that you have a likelihood of competing, assuming you’re conducting comprehensive on- and off-page optimization. The improvement over time is tricky here — if you have performed SEO in the past for the site, you should be conservative and make assumptions based on performance you have observed historically. Finally, you can now calculate potential return based on the metrics you have available: (keyword position CTR) x (keyword search volume) x (organic conversion rate) x (organic average order value) When possible, we like to make these calculations at a categorical level, applying unique conversion rate and average order volume (AOV) data to get the most accurate results. 4. Content analysis and selection After assessing the value of keywords and micro-moments, one final step needs to occur before defining content topics and types. It’s important to examine and dissect the search results and content that currently exists for each keyword. Because Google takes into account the context of each search term and displays the most relevant results, the types of results revealed will give you an idea of the intent behind the query. For example, a search term with modifiers like “best” or “top” may imply the user is seeking an article, blog post or list, while a search term that includes modifiers like “discount” or “buy” may suggest the user is looking for a product page. Inspecting content types indexed in search results can inform future content that will succeed at each stage of the consumer journey. Particularly, deciphering content trends for each phase will inform the long-term content strategy for brands and agencies to begin building together. ­With micro-moments inspired by Google, savvy marketers can see the consumer journey through a new lens and gain further insights from keyword categorization. Google has recently published an article, “Micro-Moments: 5 Questions to Ask Your Agency,” that concisely summarizes many of the aforementioned steps and recommendations. We highly encourage reviewing for assessing agency partners and internal teams alike. Some opinions expressed in this article may be those of a guest author and not necessarily Search Engine Land.

SUBSCRIBE Due to a bug, AdWords Partners are told their Search Ad specializations have expired The bug is also affecting company specialization data in Partner accounts. Ginny Marvin on October 28, 2016 at 9:19 am More Many agencies with Google Partner status received an email from Google late yesterday telling them, “You’ve lost your Search Ads specialization,” and that they will need to retake their exams. A bug has apparently triggered the emails after a change was made yesterday that affected Partners in many markets. Steve Seeley tweeted a screen shot of the email yesterday and cautioned others to “not flip out if you got emails like this last night or this morning. It is a bug. Our entire status is blank.” #ppcchat do not flip out if you got emails like this last night or this morning. It is a bug. Our entire status is blank. pic.twitter.com/TIzpI6ZTc3 — Steve Seeley (@SteveSeeley) October 28, 2016 When Partners log in to their Partner account to see their performance, the Company Specialization scores and spend fields are empty. Italy-based digital marketer Gianpaolo Lorusso tells us it’s likely a global bug, and it is definitely affecting the US, Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Spain. We’ve reached out to Google for comment and will update when we hear back. Update:  A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land, “Due to a bug, we sent an inaccurate email to a number of agencies about their Partner status. We’re asking them to disregard these notices. We’re working to fix the issue and will let our partners know when it’s resolved.” Update 10/30: The issue has been resolved. Advertisers have begun to receive notices that they have earned their specializations.

Yesterday, T-Mobile’s CEO teased the public about a big announcement which was to be made very soon with regard to the Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL. And today we’ve just got word about the specifics. The idea is very simple: if you’re a Google Pixel/Google Pixel XL owner and you bring it on T-Mobile, even if you bought it from somewhere else, the company is making an offer which comes directly from the Godfather movie, i.e. it’s so good, you can’t refuse it. So, even if you bought your Google Pixel from Verizon  and you choose to port your number on T-Mobile, you’ll get back half of what you’ve paid for. That translates into $325 which are to be returned to you in twenty four monthly installments. But, you’ll have to sign up to T-Mobile’s Magenta One, which is an unlimited plan, that’s all there is to do from your part. Obviously, you’ll have to be the owner of an unlocked Google Pixel/XL and if that’s the case, starting from tomorrow, October 28th, you can hook up with T-Mobile and start cashing in kickbacks. Every month, you’ll discover a $13,55 credit added to your monthly bill for the next 2 years, to the tune of $325. As I already told you, the Magenta One provides unlimited data, calls and texts, while unlimited video-streams are capped at 480p resolution. If you want HD streaming, you’ll have to sign up for the One Plus plan or go for a temporary HD Day Pass. With this cool offer, T-Mobile wants to emphasize the fact that the Google Pixel is not actually a Verizon exclusive and that’s obvious considering the fact that  the Google Pixel smartphones which are acquired from Verizon are not actually locked, meaning that you can use them wherever your want.

The good news is that next week, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro will go on sale officially, according to Lenovo’s store site. The phablet boasts its huge real estate display, which stands at 6.4 inches and the Google Tango 3D enabled camera which comes with Google’s latest 3D technology. Also known as Project Tango, the Tango 3D thingy scans the outside surroundings for creating very detailed 3D maps which are to be used for augmented reality-games, graphics and who knows what in the future. Don’t get confused though, because Lenovo’s website is not very well organized: the Lenovo Phab 2 is on sale as we speak, but the Pro version will not be available until November 1st, fair warning. While the Lenovo Phab 2 is a mid-ranged phablet with the same gigantic 6.4” display, the resolution is only 720p and as per internals, it runs on a MediaTek MT8735 Quad Core architecture, with 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of native storage capacity, a beefy 4500 mAh power plant and the CPUs are clocked at 1.3 Ghz. The vanilla Phab 2 runs on Android Marshmallow out of the box and it comes with 2 cameras, a 13 MP main snapper and a 5 MP secondary for video calling and selfies. The price tag is very decent at $199 and the phablet is available in Gunmetal Grey or Champagne Gold. On the other hand , the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is another story altogether, as the display boasts QHD resolution, i.e.2560×1400 pixels and it uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 system on chip under the hood. The amount of RAM on-board is 4 gigabytes and the internal storage capacity stands at 64 GB. The expected price tag of the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is rumored to be around five hundred bucks. Both the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro and the vanilla will work on GSM networks only, meaning that in the US you’ll be able to use them on T-Mobile and AT&T, fair warning folks.

On Wednesday, he promised another Robocall Strike Force meeting in six months. Does that mean he aims to stick around for a time in a potential Hillary Clinton administration, as many expect? Asked about the mandatory arbitration rules, Wheeler insists he’s not suggesting he’ll lead the commission in that work. “I tried to take pains in saying that what we were doing was establishing a process that would come to fruition at that point in time, or could come to fruition at that point in time,” Wheeler told reporters. “I will abide by the wishes of the transition of the new president, whoever that may be.” Story Continued Below ROSENWORCEL PITCHES ‘PRIVACY COUNCIL’ — FCC Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel, who voted to approve the privacy rules, suggested regulators across the federal government need to get on the same page. “I think it is time for a 21st century interagency privacy council, where this commission and our colleagues across government can do a better job of aligning privacy policies across the board,” she said at the meeting Thursday. “It is incumbent on every policymaker with privacy authority to think about how to make our policies more simple and more consistent.” The differences between the FCC rules and the FTC’s approach — which is seen as less prescriptive — emerged as a point of contention leading up to the vote. — Asked about Rosenworcel’s idea, GOP Commissioner Mike O’Rielly said it’s unclear if the FCC has the authority to create such a council, and suggested it may have to be greenlighted by Congress. THE DATE IS SET — The Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee says its hearing on the AT&T-Time-Warner deal will take place on Dec. 7. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes are both slated to testify. NEXT IN MERGER MANIA: CENTURYLINK-LEVEL 3? — The two telecom companies are in talks for a potential merger that could be announced in the next several weeks, reports The Wall Street Journal. A combination could offer CenturyLink and Level 3, which focus in large part on business customers, a chance to maintain a competitive edge in a cutthroat and increasingly consolidated industry.

FIRST IN MT: TECH TO ASK FOR POST-OBAMA DATA ROLE — The Commerce Data Advisory Council — formed by Secretary Penny Pritzker a year and a half ago to get the tech world’s guidance on how to make best use of the agency’s huge caches of economic data — will make the pitch today for its continued existence. “It is imperative that these initiatives become part of the Commerce fabric and do not end with this Administration,” reads one of the new recommendations of the 19-member group, which includes LinkedIn co-founder Allen Blue, Google director of open source Chris DiBona, and ESRI President Jack Dangermond. Justin Antonipillai, acting undersecretary for economic affairs, tells MT: “These are companies that know how to bring visibility to data." Pritzker speaks to the last scheduled meeting of the group at 9 a.m. today; video feed here.

Ron Johnson has drawn closer recently, though Feingold, who was bounced from office by Johnson six years ago, remains ahead, reports Reuters. A Feingold win could give the tech industry another key supporter in Congress when it comes to protecting user data from government surveillance. While serving as a senator from 1993 to 2011, Feingold was the sole lawmaker to vote against the USA Patriot Act in 2001. Having that kind of voice in Congress could be valuable to Silicon Valley as Congress gears up to debate reauthorizing Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. APPLE OFFERED CLINTON TEAM ENCRYPTION BRIEFING — A May 2015 email hacked from the account of Hillary for America chairman John Podesta and released by WikiLeaks shows Apple offering to give the Clinton campaign a rundown on the topic of encryption. (To be clear, this was months before the face-off between the FBI and Apple over an iPhone said to have been used by one of the San Bernardino shooters; encryption was in the news because tech companies and others had written a letter to President Barack Obama on the subject.) “If you ever want our tech experts to brief your folks, we’d be happy to do it,” Apple VP — and former EPA Administrator — Lisa Jackson writes Podesta. The note is passed to campaign policy adviser Jake Sullivan, who responds: “I’d love to have your experts work with our team.” It’s unclear whether there was any follow-up. UBER’S FLYING CARS — The ride-hailing firm just launched its self-driving car fleet in Pittsburgh, but the firm has already set its sights on another type of vehicle: the flying kind. In a Medium post and white paper released Thursday, Uber describes its goal of having a fleet of electric aircraft to help people cut down on their commute time. The ambitious plan envisions vertical-takeoff-and-landing planes that buzz between urban heliports and building roofs. Of course, regulators would have to approve. OUR FAVORITE LONG READS THIS WEEK — “Obama Brought Silicon Valley to Washington” in The New York Times Magazine: “In many ways, Obama is America’s first truly digital president. ... For better or for worse, the last eight years have been defined less by the rise of small tech companies than by the expansion of Big Tech. We’ve seen the second Silicon Valley boom, with companies valued in the billions, including Facebook, Uber, Snapchat, Palantir and Dropbox. Established technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have expanded their reach and influence throughout the world. And while many countries have pushed back against that spread, our government has essentially left them alone.” — “Google’s Self-Driving Car Design Boss Speaks on Her Strategy,” in The Verge: “[YooJung] Ahn is designing the Google car interior to be a soothing environment. She wants passengers to feel safe, but also relaxed. The open seats are made of compressible foam, also used on the front bumper, which Ahn says is more comfortable than traditional seats. Buttons and controls are kept to a minimum. ‘We needed to create something relatable and intuitive, which is not confusing,’ Ahn says. ‘People had never imagined anything like that before.’” — “Is an American Company’s Technology Helping Turkey Spy on its Citizens?” in Forbes: “According to a half dozen current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, leaked Procera [Networks] documents and internal communications, Turk Telekom requested [from the California-based company] not just a feed of subscribers’ usernames and passwords for unencrypted websites, but also their IP addresses, what sites they’d visited and when. ‘Erdoğan is insane and people could well die from this work,’ one former Procera employee told FORBES. Another said: ‘The installation in Turkey is large-scale surveillance of the population with feeds to one or other governmental agency.’” — “Uber Found an Unlikely Friend in Organized Labor,” in Bloomberg: “The [Independent Drivers Guild] isn’t a traditional union. Drivers didn’t vote for it. It has no formal collective-bargaining rights. And its very existence helps the company resist formal unionization, says Arun Sundararajan, a business professor at New York University who researches the economics of the tech industry. ‘This is just them planting something in the ground that might deter more contentious forms of labor organizing,’ he says.” — “Inside the Trump Bunker, with 12 Days to Go,” in Bloomberg Businessweek: “A young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation he’d created of Clinton delivering the ‘super predator’ line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: ‘Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.’ The animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook ‘dark posts.’ ... The aim is to depress Clinton’s vote total. ‘We know because we’ve modeled this,’ says [a senior] official. ‘It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.’” TRANSITIONS — Comcast has promoted Beth Choroser to a Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. She has been at the company since 2000 and will focus on the FCC. ... Speaking of the FCC, Stephanie Weiner, a senior legal adviser in the chairman’s office, is leaving the agency after working on several policy areas, including net neutrality, Lifeline and broadband privacy. Lisa Hone, an associate bureau chief in the agency’s Wireline Competition Bureau, is joining the chairman’s office next month as a legal adviser on wireline issues.

Tech to Track: Cloud computing and public utilities, new gear from MS and Apple and more October 28th, 2016 Here’s another installment of Tech to Track, a list of cool technology links we’re interested in and thought we’d share with you. What cloud computing and public utilities have in common A Florida resident, David Gewirtz regularly weathers battering storms like the recent Hurricane Matthew. He makes an interesting comparison between public utilities and cloud computing platforms, and what happens when both stop working. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it’s one of the reasons why we’re so adamant about the 3-2-1 Backup Strategy. Go local with your backup, then go to the cloud (with Backblaze). That way you’re covered even if Internet connectivity goes down. Weathering Hurricane Matthew: What public utilities can learn from cloud computing Google Fiber punts expansion plans, but it’s not the end of the line Google’s putting the brakes on new high-speed fiber optic network rollouts, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the end of this project — just a “review of strategy,” according to a new report. Google Fiber already operates in a handful of cities; Google is committed to building out other locations. But Google’s halted further expansion plans to Dallas, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, San Jose, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Portland, and Tampa. Google may instead focus on new and forthcoming high-speed wireless technology to help get massive bandwidth to customers. How are your high-speed options? Are you lucky enough to be in a Google Fiber area? Do you have a fiber connection through another provider, cable, or something else? Tell us in the comments. Google fiber puts expansion plans on hold to review strategy Microsoft woos creative pros with Surface Studio Microsoft wants to out-Apple Apple with its minimalist Surface Studio, a desktop computer with 28-inch LCD display. The Surface Studio works with Microsoft’s Surface Pen and a new Dial input device. There’s an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor inside with up to 32 GB RAM. It’s not for the faint-of-wallet, though: The new computer goes on sale this holiday season starting at just a skosh under $3,000. The good news is that it’s a Windows 10 device, so you can install Backblaze on it and be sure you’ve backed up all your new creative work! But maybe you should keep a whiteboard and some markers around just in case the occasional grumpy NFL coach shows up. A look at Microsoft’s fancy Surface Studio Apple reveals new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Not to be outdone, Apple is revamping its venerable MacBook Pro line with a new model that’s faster, thinner and lighter than before, with Thunderbolt 3 ports, better Retina Display, and bigger trackpad. The centerpiece is a new Touch Bar OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) interface that replaces function keys: It’s software-programmable, so the interface changes depending on which app you’re using. Laptops with the new Touch Bar come in 13 and 15-inch sizes starting at about $1,800. You also get your color choice of silver or space gray.

John Podesta, chairman of the 2016 Hilary Clinton presidential campaign Joshua Roberts / Reuters Most Popular John Oliver, Activist Megan Garber 11:50 AM ET After the Election: ‘What a Pathetic Thing Is Decadence’ James Fallows 3:15 PM ET The Post-Election Surge in Donations Adam Chandler 4:31 PM ET Supermoon 2016 Alan Taylor 11:48 AM ET Clinton's Popular-Vote Lead Will Grow, and Grow, and Grow Andrew McGill Nov 13, 2016 Conor Friedersdorf Oct 28, 2016 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size The successful breach of John Podesta’s email account is the latest high-profile hack to expose thousands upon thousands of private missives to the public. With the Sony Pictures debacle in the recent past and no prospect of perfect digital security, more breaches seem inevitable. So why do email providers, organizations, and individuals only seem interested in one approach to thwarting thefts? A difficult-to-guess password, two-factor authentication, attentiveness to phishing schemes, and security features at companies like Google and Apple are all variations on a theme: All are attempts to secure an email account so that unauthorized folks can’t break in. Once a breach happens, the game is lost. But what if that were just the beginning? * * * Say that you’re 70 and you unexpectedly learn that you require a surgery that will keep you in the hospital for a week. You adamantly don’t want any of your grandkids to find the will in your house that reveals who among them gets what. You suspect they’ll be snooping against your wishes. And you have 12 hours at home to prepare. You could pick a hiding spot that they probably wouldn’t guess but might find. You could put the will in a padlocked trunk and take the key with you. But what if they still find some way into the trunk? In fact, your grandson does find a way to remove the wooden bottom, look through its contents, replace them, and reseal the trunk without you even knowing. Luckily, you anticipated this possibility. When he breached the trunk, he was able to lay hands on your will in its envelop marked “Last Will and Testament.” But the trunk included 30 different envelopes that all said “Last Will and Testament.” Each held a list with very different bequeathals. Your grandson had no way of knowing which was the real will, though he held it in his hands. Only your lawyer knew which one was real. Hiding something is one way to keep it secure. Overwhelming would-be snoops with plausible decoys is another way. Yet virtually no one’s email inbox is deliberately seeded with fake messages so that prying eyes cannot entirely know what is real. Imagine a startup called Plausible Deniability LLC. When I first conceived it years ago, I thought that the firm would be given access to the Google accounts of its customers, for the purpose of obscuring search histories. Over time, at random moments, it would perform searches generally regarded as embarrassing. “Donald Trump sex tape.” “Signs you have an Oedipus complex.” “Herbal cures for chlamydia, gluten free.” “What is Aleppo?” “Why is my credit score so low?” “Does huffing cat litter cause erectile dysfunction?” The company would not store any data on the searches that it performed, only that a given person was a customer and therefore not necessarily responsible for a search. I used to think Plausible Deniability could start off marketing itself to Stanford strivers who didn’t want to be blackmailed by a hacker during their 2032 Senate run. “My fellow Californians, I never searched for ‘molly delivery.’ Like some of you, I’m a customer of Plausible Deniability to protect my privacy from snoops.” But I didn’t want would-be politicians helped so much as the person who hesitates before conducting a search like “suicide helpline” or “free anonymous HIV testing.” Success would’ve depended in part on whether Plausible Deniability became common knowledge. After all, some would be put off by the danger of signing up for a service that generates fake searches. What if everyone later believed that a fake was real? The concept would only work if lots of people came to know about the tactic, and it was used by lots of people, not just outliers trying to hide a terrible secret. In fact, that hurdle, along with the fact that profitability would spawn instant competitors, meant that the only likely path to a new norm of plausible deniability would’ve been a company like Google or Yahoo offering such a service free to its users. Had the idea expanded to email, John Podesta’s account would’ve included “sent emails” that he never actually sent, alongside the actual emails that make him and some of his correspondents look bad. (Would fake messages appear only in sent mail, or would contacts occasionally get messages that they’re texted to disregard or that bypass their inbox but live in their archives?) If the fakes had ranged from the wildly implausible, like a note about how Hillary Clinton was the true killer of JFK, all the way to the fake but totally plausible, like a note to George Soros complaining about Stephen Bannon, Podesta would’ve gained plausible deniability. To be clear, I would dislike that outcome in his case. I agree with Glenn Greenwald that knowing the contents of some Podesta emails is in the public interest. There would be lots of instances in which Plausible Deniability would be bad for journalists. It should certainly be illegal to use for official government business.   But I wouldn’t mind if Plausibility Deniability gave Podesta cover for the purely private emails in his archives—“Dear Larry, Just FYI, that was, indeed, one of the algorithmically generated decoy emails!”—and especially if it gave cover to private citizens when their communications are hacked and posted online. A price of the privacy most people want is always that a few bad actors aren’t fully exposed. To me, the benefits that privacy confers on a free society are worth it. Stepping back, the big idea is combining pessimism about our ability to really protect anything from being seen in today’s digital world with the insight that, in some cases, having verifiably created a fake personal-data trail, or contracting with a third party who provides that service, could offer plausible deniability that enhances privacy. I’ve also wondered if, say, a feminist, gaming journalist who keeps getting doxxed would find it easier to keep her current phone number or address from the Internet hordes if she flooded the web with fake phone numbers and addresses, in addition to trying to keep her actual phone number and address closely held. And if the Office of Personnel Management had kept 10 fake background files alongside every real one, maybe the OPM hack would’ve proved less costly. It’s easy to imagine other iterations of this idea. No approach is without drawbacks and none offers perfect privacy, either. (In fact, it’s probably a good thing that there will always be ways to verify the realness of some information with enough effort.) Still, this largely unexploited approach seems to promise more personal privacy in a world where that good is rapidly disappearing in many unfortunate ways. We operate under the delusion that the traditional approach to information security is adequate. How many major hacks will it take to persuade us, at the very least, to send this article to a shortlist of contacts with a note that says, “For future reference, I’ve already started doing this for plausible deniability”? That email might come in handy one day. Share Tweet Comments Latest Video What Does St. Louis Feel Like Now? In a short documentary, residents reflect on what racial reconciliation—if any—has happened in the segregated city. Nadine Ajaka 1:49 PM ET About the Author Conor Friedersdorf is a staff writer at The Atlantic, where he focuses on politics and national affairs. He lives in Venice, California, and is the founding editor of The Best of Journalism, a newsletter devoted to exceptional nonfiction. Twitter Email previousInside a Hacking Competition to Take Down a Water-Treatment PlantnextHow a Sculptor Adapted to Today's Economy Most Popular Presented by HBO John Oliver, Activist Megan Garber “We need to stay here and fight,” he told his audience on Sunday evening. During Sunday night’s episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver made an impassioned plea to his viewers. “We need to stay here and fight,” the comedian said. For the last eight years, we’ve had a president we could assume would generally stand up for the rights of all Americans. But that is going to change now. So we’re going to have to actively stand up for one another. And it can’t just be sounding off on the internet or sharing think pieces or videos like this one that echo around your bubble. I’m talking about actual sacrifice to support people who are now under threat. It was a striking monologue—not just because it was distinctly earnest, but also because it was distinctly unfunny. The comedian’s first show since Donald Trump clinched the U.S. presidency (which doubled, as it happens, as the comedian’s final show of the 2016 season) had its laugh-out-loud moments, but for the most part Oliver’s message was sober. It was sad. It largely dispensed with the jokes in favor of some selective Real Talk. Continue Reading Wikimedia After the Election: ‘What a Pathetic Thing Is Decadence’ James Fallows None Thank you to readers for the hundreds of messages that have been pouring in daily. In most of the time since the election, I have been in transit for a long-scheduled set of American-innovation events in the mountain west, Cheyenne and Laramie in specific; and trying to write a completely unscheduled article for the magazine; and absorbing the psychological and intellectual effects of what our country has just done to itself. I had not expected that I would ever again feel as paralyzed, withdrawn, and downcast as I did after my father died eight years ago. But that expectation was a failure of tragic imagination on my part. I was wrong. Continue Reading Jim Urquhart / Reuters The Post-Election Surge in Donations Adam Chandler Following Donald Trump’s victory, groups that pledge to fight his proposed policies are seeing record contributions. In the aftermath of last week’s elections, many of those dismayed with the results took their frustrations into the streets, fashioned justice-minded movements on social media, and consoled themselves by tuning into various late-night shows, some of which broke from comedy to address national tensions. But perhaps the most notable (and most concrete) action to follow the end of the divisive election season has been a surge in donations to various organizations whose agendas counter those proposed by President-elect Donald Trump. In recent days, groups that champion causes like civil liberties and women’s health as well as focus on immigration rights and anti-discrimination initiatives have seen record responses to the election, in the form of contributions and volunteer applications. Continue Reading Paul Kane / Getty Supermoon 2016 Alan Taylor Look up in the sky tonight for a remarkable perigee-syzygy of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. Last night, and later tonight, skywatchers around the world will be treated to views of this year's so-called "supermoon," the largest full moon of the year. Today, on November 14, at 6:20 am Eastern time, the moon approached within 356,500 km (221,500 mi) of Earth, in what is scientifically known as a perigee-syzygy of the Earth-Moon-Sun system (perigee: closest point of an elliptical orbit; syzygy: straight line made of three bodies in a gravitational system). Though the moon does appear larger than normal, the size difference is so small that a casual observer would probably never notice. Nonetheless, photographers across the globe set out to capture the event, and collected here are 21 of the most super images of this year's supermoon. If your skies are clear, be sure to look up around moonrise tonight.

They won’t change anything, though. Updated on November 13 at 4:22 p.m. ET This chart has been making the rounds on Twitter these past few days: Turns out it's not a Trump insurgency, but a Clinton collapse. A graph that cuts straight through today's punditry ... pic.twitter.com/x41cyyy2XI — Jonathan Webber (@jonathanwebber) November 9, 2016 Donald Trump didn’t actually flip many Democrats, the thinking goes. Instead, Hillary Clinton failed to turn out liberal voters who had previously voted for Barack Obama. It’s a tempting narrative for smarting progressives, as it maintains status quo thinking—Clinton’s unlikable!—and removes any culpability on the part of the Democrats for missing a massive shift in the electorate. In other words, it’s Clinton’s fault, not theirs, that Trump won the presidency. Continue Reading Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Joe Biden, a Meme for All Seasons Megan Garber In the aftermath of the election, some Americans have taken solace in imagining the outgoing administration pranking the new one. A meme, pared of its particulars, is democracy making fun of itself. And during the eight years of the Obama presidency in the United States, there has been no public figure who has lent himself so readily to memery than Vice President Joe Biden. You can attribute that to a combination of factors—his genial, expressive face; his persona’s mixture of frankness and affability; the fact that he occupies an office that lends itself especially well to fan-fictional speculation; his general intolerance for malarkey—but they have resulted, all in all, in Biden becoming, in the worst way and also the best, a running joke. One of the most common memes goes like this: Take a picture of Obama and Biden together—bonus points if Biden looks giddy, and even more if points if Obama looks reluctant. Add dialogue—usually something that will get at the idea of Biden being childlike and needy and mischievous, and of Obama, decades younger and yet much more the adult, keeping his vice president in check. Apply it to the State of the Union. Or, really, to anything. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters Why White Women Continue to Back the GOP Michelle Cottle The voters have largely supported Republican candidates for years, which underscores the complicated nature of their political interests. People are processing last week’s election shocker in a million different ways, many of them involving large quantities of alcohol. But I swear I’ve read, heard, and been asked to explain one particular aspect of the vote at least a million times: How on God’s green earth did Hillary Clinton fail to win the support of white women? The prevailing sense seems to be that Clinton was a candidate inexplicably, uncommonly unpalatable to this voting block. After all, women trend Democratic, right? Plus, this time around, there was a woman at the top of the Democratic ticket. And on top of that, Clinton’s opponent was a proudly vulgar, overtly misogynistic, self-proclaimed sexual predator. So what the hell happened with white women? Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters The Radical Anti-Conservatism of Stephen Bannon Conor Friedersdorf Donald Trump’s campaign manager wants to destroy the left. And the GOP nominee is just the most recent vessel of convenience in his consequences-be-damned crusade. Stephen Bannon, who recently took over as Donald Trump’s campaign manager, once gave an interview, while promoting his 2010 film, “Fire From the Heartland: the Awakening of the Conservative Woman,” where he argued that Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, and Ann Coulter pose an existential threat to the left. “These women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative,” he explained. “That's one of the unintended consequences of the women's liberation movement––that, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be feminine, they would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn't be a bunch of dykes that came from the 7 Sisters schools." The quote captures a key attribute of the former U.S. Navy officer, whose stints at Georgetown University, Harvard Business School, and Goldman Sachs afforded a foothold at the core of America’s elite, enabling him to launch a film career that began with a Sean Penn collaboration before segueing into polemic right-wing documentaries. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters The Trump Administration Starts to Take Shape Clare Foran To the dismay of some Republicans and Democrats alike, Steve Bannon has earned a top spot in the White House’s inner circle. President-elect Donald Trump’s administration is starting to take shape. In a statement on Sunday, Trump announced that Reince Priebus, the chair of the Republican National Committee, will serve as White House chief of staff. Steve Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, a conservative website that has promoted white ethno-nationalism, will serve as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president. Priebus literally presides over the GOP establishment; Bannon has numbered among its fiercest critics. But although in most administrations, the chief of staff runs the White House, the announcement went to some pains to present them as peers: Bannon and Priebus will continue the effective leadership team they formed during the campaign, working as equal partners to transform the federal government. Continue Reading Eric Nyquist The Case Against Cats Britt Peterson The animal so many dote on is among the world’s most destructive predators. New Zealand’s recent announcement of a plan to eradicate all invasive predators, including feral cats, sparked an immediate response—and not in defense of the stoat, up there with cats among the top 100 on the Global Invasive Species list. “Cat murdering New Zealand[ers] are for the birds,” one commenter vented on The Washington Post’s website. “Removing cats from an area is a futile effort—one that cannot succeed,” another warned. When Australia announced a plan in 2015 to cull 2 million feral cats, the singer Morrissey declared them “2 million smaller versions of Cecil the lion.” The actress Brigitte Bardot called the cull “animal genocide.” Needless to say, no celebrity outrage or online indignation has greeted New Zealand’s or Australia’s expensive and long-standing rat-eradication programs.

 Hacker who stole nude photos from Jennifer Lawrence sentenced to 18 months in prison Hannah Roberts Oct. 28, 2016, 9:54 AM 11,759 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jennifer Lawrence was one of the hacker's many female celebrity victims. Juan Naharro Gimenez/ Getty Images The hacker who obtained access to the Apple and Google accounts of more than 100 well-known celebrities — including Jennifer Lawrence and Rihanna — has been sentenced to 18 months in federal prison, the Guardian reported. Ryan Collins, a 36-year-old from Pennsylvania, tricked his victims by sending them fake Apple or Google emails asking them to provide their username and passwords. He accessed more than 100 accounts, many belonging to female celebrities. However, it appears that Collins might not be "OriginalGuy," the 4Chan user who dumped his massive collection of nude celebrity photos online in August 2014, causing mayhem. That person remains unidentified. Collins sometimes used a software program to download the Apple iCloud backups on his victims' accounts, the US Attorney office said. Investigators identified over 600 victims in total — Collins also ran a modeling scam where he got victims to send him nude photos directly.  The sentencing comes after a two year investigation by the FBI which began following a particular online post that became known as "Celebgate" — a collection of almost 500 private pictures of over 100 mostly-female celebrities — on the internet forum 4chan. Victims included Avril Lavigne, Kim Kardashian, Kirsten Dunst, Aubrey Plaza, Winona Ryder — as well as Jennifer Lawrence and Rihanna. However, the US Attorney said: "investigators have not uncovered any evidence linking Collins to the actual leaks [in Celebgate] or that Collins shared or uploaded the information he obtained". He was sentenced for his sophisticated scheme to obtain usersnames and passwords — which officials said he engaged in from November 2012 until the beginning of September 2014. The official conviction was on "felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act". Collins pleaded guilty to the computer hacking felony back in May, on one count of "unauthorised access to a protected computer to obtain information". Illinois man Edward Majerczyck, 28, also pleaded guilty to the same felony, months later. Like Collins, federal authorities said they had found no evidence linking him to actual public circulation of any of the photos to which he gained access.  NOW WATCH: A mysterious cloud moving 700,000 mph is going to collide with our galaxy — here's what will happen Loading video...

While carriers have occasionally had limited freedom to defile customize certain models sold through their service, owners were at least free to either modify the stock software or completely replace it with custom builds. It goes without saying people were more than a little disappointed to learn Google’s second attempt to team up with US carrier Verizon lead to yet another disappointing result: the Google Pixels sold through VZW have non-unlockable bootloaders.

TechRepublic Cover Story Share Share Facebook LinkedIn {'global.comments.comment.singular.scase'|trans}} 0 Twitter Email to a friend More NASA shows the world its 20-year virtual reality experiment to train astronauts: The inside story By Erin Carson Apple's first employee: The remarkable odyssey of Bill Fernandez By Jason Hiner Hacking the Nazis: The secret story of the women who broke Hitler's codes By Nick Heath Our autonomous future: How driverless cars will be the first robots we learn to trust By Hope Reese In this in-depth report, learn why self-driving cars are inevitable, what the industry is doing about safety, and what it will take to get autonomous vehicles into the mainstream. In March 2015, an Audi SQ5 began its nine-day journey from the Golden Gate Bridge to midtown Manhattan. The 3400-mile drive involved the normal obstacles: construction, highways, city driving, lane-passing. What wasn't involved? Hands on the wheel. Until recently, the concept of a driverless car seemed like the stuff of science fiction. But much has changed in just a few short years as the technology behind autonomous vehicles has taken huge strides. The cross-country driving Audi, powered by technology from Delphi, drove in autonomous mode 99 percent of the time. The US federal government has also begun to embrace autonomous vehicles as a coming reality. In February 2016, the US Department of Transportation (US DOT) announced that it considers the AI powering Google's driverless cars (which have already logged hundreds of thousands of self-driven miles) officially a "driver"—marking a groundbreaking moment in the history of transportation. And in September 2016, the DOT unveiled guidelines for the development of autonomous vehicles, calling it "the most comprehensive national, automated vehicle policy that the world has ever seen." Download this article as a PDF (free registration required). The adoption of driverless vehicles has also come under scrutiny—most notably after the fatal accident that happened in May 2016 when Joshua Brown, operating his Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode, crashed into an 18-wheel tractor trailer. The incident highlighted the complex technological and social hurdles still facing the widespread adoption of driverless vehicles. Since then, Tesla has also released an update to Autopilot, which Elon Musk said would have likely prevented the accident. Despite the debate, one fact is undisputed: Autonomous vehicles are here, and many more are coming. In Singapore and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, self-driving taxis are now shuttling passengers on public roads. By 2020, more than a dozen companies plan to unveil cars with some level of autonomous driving SEE: Autonomous driving levels 0 to 5: Understanding the differences Ford announced its intention to mass-produce fully-autonomous, level 5 vehicles by 2021—that's no steering wheel, no brakes, no human required. According to a report from BI Intelligence, there will be 10 million of them on the road at that point. Why now? So why are the automakers and the government getting on board now? Autonomous driving has a long history—the first form of self-driving cars, powered by a radio antennae, was developed almost a century ago, back in 1925. And some of the technology that is being used today has been around for decades. In 1989, Carnegie Mellon was already using neural networks to control its autonomous vehicles, and by the 1990s, they already had their own vehicle that could drive cross-country. The first form of a self-driving cars, powered by a radio antennae, was developed almost a century ago, in 1925. Image: Radio News, November 1925, americanradiohistory.com However, a variety of factors have combined in recent years to make driverless vehicles ready for wide adoption. Gill Pratt, head of the Toyota Research Institute, part of a $1 billion investment in AI, points to several reasons why. Mobile phones: The explosive growth of mobile technology, the low-powered computer processor, the computer vision chips and cameras, and cell phones in general have become "incredibly inexpensive and ubiquitous." Wireless internet: The rise of 4G networks and WiFi have made it easier than ever to connect. Computer centers in cars: Most new cars today have backup cameras, front and back sensors, and other technologies that help the vehicles detect objects in the environment and alert the driver. Maps: If you're talking about either the navigation system you have in your car, said Pratt, or Google Maps in your phone, digital maps have become really good. Deep learning: Some computers now have "perception at levels of competence close to what a human has," said Pratt. "The car can look out on the world and tell the difference between a bicycle and a person that's walking, and a tree and a parking meter—and it can then classify them either almost as well as we can, or in some cases, even a little bit better." "The technology has finally become mature," said Jeffrey Miller, IEEE member and associate professor of engineering at the University of Southern California. Although vehicles have been equipped with intelligent features for the past couple of decades, such as pop-up headlights, automatic seatbelts, adaptive cruise control, lane correction, and more, the technology is now becoming "better, more reliable, and more cost-effective." Tech hurdles But even with these great leaps forward, fully-autonomous cars are several years off. There are still software and mechanical hurdles to overcome, and different companies are taking different approaches to testing out new technology. For example, Google is still updating software on a near-daily basis, said Miller. And some companies are still negotiating the balance (and tradeoff) of power that happens when the driver needs to regain control of the car. "We have decided not to let 'perfect' be the enemy of the 'better.' Instead, we will release 'better' as soon as it is available." Tesla spokesperson Jim McBride, autonomous vehicles expert at Ford, said that his company will be skipping Level 3, which involves transferring control from car to human, to get straight to Level 4, with no driver required. "We're not going to ask the driver to instantaneously intervene," said McBride. "That's not a fair proposition." Bryant Walker Smith, professor at the University of South Carolina, also sees a major problem with Level 3. "If there's a hazard on the road and if the driver doesn't re-engage, the system doesn't have to do anything about it," he said "That's a very scary design prospect." Environmental factors are a concern as well. Navigating tricky situations at stop signs, figuring out what to do when unknown variables like animals run into the road or driving safely in bad weather can be problematic. Most systems, said Smith, have not yet been tested in snow. Despite these barriers, Tesla has taken a unique approach when it comes to integrating new technology. A Tesla representative told TechRepublic that the company is "disruptive, in the original sense of the word." "We have decided not to let 'perfect' be the enemy of the 'better,'" the Tesla rep said. "Instead, we will release 'better' as soon as it is available." Regulatory hurdles In addition to technical and safety questions, Federal and state regulations are also still being worked out. But the Federal government is not sitting idly by. In January 2016, the Obama administration announced a plan to invest nearly $4 billion into research for autonomous driving. And a groundbreaking announcement by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the following month allowed for the AI system controlling Google's self-driving car to be considered a driver, in response to the company's proposal to the NHTSA in November 2015. In September 2016, the DOT announced the first-ever guidelines for autonomous driving. Some states currently have specific laws that would ban autonomous driving—the state of New York, for instance, does not allow any hands-free driving. Without clear regulations, testing self-driving cars is a challenge. And although a few states—California, Nevada, Florida, and Michigan—currently allow autonomous vehicles on the road, California is the only one with licensing regulations at this point. Miller told TechRepublic he thinks it's because of the pressure Silicon Valley puts on lobbyists in California. "They're lobbying the legislature, saying 'hey, you've gotta do something,'" said Miller. "And California doesn't want Google to go to another state to get help." But without specific regulations, many questions remain unanswered. Autonomous driving is poised to shake up the entire car insurance industry, for example, and there are still many unanswered questions when it comes to liability. What will licensing look like? Will new drivers still be required to get traditional licenses, even if they aren't behind the wheel? What about young people, or older people with disabilities? What will be required to operate these new vehicles? Governments need to work quickly to catch up with tech. Auto regulations are some of the strictest—and obviously for good reason, since public safety is on the line. Where will we see them first? So where will we first start seeing driverless cars? Again, Singapore now has self-driving taxis in a limited area of the city, and Uber has unveiled its own driverless fleet in Pittsburgh. But these cars are still operated by safety engineers behind the wheel, taking notes. Ford's CEO has said that its own driverless cars will likely start out in ride-sharing fleets. And Tesla's updated Masterplan also highlights its intention to weave shared vehicles into the mix. Uber released a self-driving test fleet on the streets of Pittsburgh, PA, in September 2016. Image credit: Uber But beyond this, the answer is still unclear. Many predict that the trucking industry will be massively disrupted by driverless technology. Miller predicts that in the next five years, the first vehicles will be high-end luxury models bought by consumers. And who we see owning them will depend, in a large part, on where we're looking. "It's a cultural/societal issue whether it's accepted," Miller said. "There are countries in Europe where public transportation is the primary means of getting around—so car sharing will be popular." But in places like LA? "Car ownership is a big part of what's ingrained in society... it could take more time." Who's in the lead? Wondering who's in the front of the race right now? While companies like Tesla and Google have gotten a lot of press lately, it's still too early to tell. "This is still an emerging technology," said Thilo Koslowski, former vice president and automotive practice leader at Gartner. Miller agrees: "The big players right now may not be the big players in a few years." Ford says it will release self-driving cars in 2021. And Tesla says its level 5, fully-autonomous cars will be ready in 2018—and in October, announced that every Tesla in production will now have the hardware to be capable of self-driving. Beyond the question of who will be first, Koslowski isn't sure that kind of comparison makes sense, anyway. Why? Once the technology is perfected, companies like Google will be looking for partners. Also, "anybody who's working on this helps the entire category," Koslowski said. Consumers aren't necessarily looking to buy the first model to hit the market, either. Economist Adam Grant makes a good argument for why it can be smart to wait until after the first version is out. "There's a learning curve and a trust factor that needs to be considered," said Koslowski. Trust issues At the heart of the driverless car question is consumer acceptance. While the technology factor is necessary to get these vehicles on the road, how to make these vehicles work is just one part of the equation. The second, Koslowski told TechRepublic, is "rethinking the entire car culture we've built over the past century." The experience of driving is about to radically change in a world of self-driving cars. And the issue of trust will be central to the adoption of the new technology. According to Koslowski, the societal aspect is the real hurdle. Miller agrees. "The core challenge," he said, "is determining whether the relevant technologies have reached a demonstrated level of socially acceptable risk." "All of a sudden we're delegating a task that consumers have been doing for a century to a robot." Thilo Koslowski, former Gartner analyst So what is a socially-acceptable level of risk? According to Koslowski, Smith, and others, it depends on a public understanding that these cars will not be flawless. But that's not an easy thing for many people to get their heads around. "This is the first robot that we will experience on a day-to-day basis," he said. "Loss of control and trust is what a lot of people have problems with. All of a sudden we're delegating a task that consumers have been doing for a century to a robot." While working as Senior Advisor for Innovation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Alec Ross, author of Industries of the Future, traveled to 41 countries. He observed a deeply-ingrained distrust of robots, particular in Western society. According to Ross, the concept of robots carry "cultural baggage" that may not be easy to shake. "How quickly can we get consumers to feel comfortable and want these technologies?" asks Koslowski. The answer depends on how realistic we are, he said. Although safety is predicted to improve significantly, with an expected 80% reduction in accidents by 2040, the idea of "safety" may need to be redefined, shifting from driver to software. According to Smith, new areas of concern could include technical failures, related to bugs, as well as security vulnerabilities—cybersecurity will become a major concern when these cars hit the road. Still, the danger posed by cybersecurity attacks "pales in comparison to the carnage on the road today," said Smith. "I'm concerned about the vulnerability of vehicles, but I'm terrified about today's drivers in today's vehicles." There are about 32,000 fatalities per year due to auto accidents in the United States (the average number peaked at around 55,000 per year in the early 1970s), according to data from the NHTSA. Over 90% of those accidents are caused by human error, as reported in multiple studies. But even with the assumption that safety will improve, the combination of technical uncertainties with cultural baggage in the western world make it likely that we will have a low tolerance for error when it comes to safety in autonomous vehicles. Many people may find it more forgivable for a human to make a mistake on the road than the computer that's in charge. Smith predicted that "the first crash, the first injuries and fatalities, will be a big deal." A Tesla spokesperson echoed this point. "Any given regulator will be crucified for an issue with a feature or technology they approved that had a bug." The predictions were proven correct after influential publications like the New York Times portrayed the Tesla Autopilot crash in a critical way without taking the whole context into consideration. In that case, a major hurdle was understanding the difference between Tesla's Autopilot feature—which is more of an advanced cruise control—and a fully-autonomous car, which doesn't require the attention of the driver. The open road So perhaps the greatest challenge will be getting society on board—literally. Driving cars is deeply ingrained in American culture. There's a romanticism about getting on the open road for the first time. "Most of us grew up thinking of freedom as a steering wheel and a learner's permit," said journalist Pagan Kennedy. "I vividly remember the first time I stomped on a gas pedal and zoomed out onto a highway; the car pounced with such force that I was thrown back in the seat. That sensation is still burned into my mind." "Most of us grew up thinking of freedom as a steering wheel and a learner's permit." Pagan Kennedy, journalist Letting go of the wheel will undoubtedly require a culture shift, letting go of the nostalgia. And when it comes to entrusting a self-driving vehicle to keep them safe, people have varying levels of comfort. When asked how they would feel about riding in a driverless vehicle, some respondents, like Anna Munoz, executive assistant at CBS Interactive in San Francisco, gave a flat-out "No." Ms. Munoz, presumably like many others, trusts herself over a self-driving car. "Nothing would get me to try it," she said. Others are open to it—just not quite yet. Joe Jones, co-founder of iRobot, is willing to let a car take over if something goes wrong, yet still feels that "self driving cars haven't yet achieved the level of reliability where I'd be comfortable without a fail-safe mechanism." And Helen Greiner, CEO of CyPhy Works, a drone company, also has mixed feelings. "I'd be comfortable driving if I had the ability to grab the wheel—in few years," said Greiner. "If I'm going to be in the backseat and the car's fully driving, I think it's going to take me a little bit longer." Still, some are perfectly comfortable ceding control. Roman Yampolskiy, director of Cyber Security Laboratory at the University of Louisville, puts it this way: "I had the 'privilege' of being driven by teenagers and seniors, and would pay good money to have an AI drive me instead." A Tesla Meetup group in St. Louis, MO, gathers around their Teslas after a dinner spent talking about Autopilot. Image: Hope Reese/TechRepublic Joanne Pransky, the self-dubbed "robot psychiatrist," echoed the sentiment: "What could be more life-threatening than sitting as a passenger in a car being driven by a distracted teen in training? Self-driving cars can't come soon enough!" And despite her romantic memories of the open road, Kennedy would also "let a robot take control." "I am terrible driver," she said. "Just ask my boyfriend." But whether fully-autonomous driving arrives in two years or five, there is no doubt that it is close—and no doubt that it will radically alter the way we live. We could use smartphones as an analogy, said Smith. "If you went back 15 years and asked people if they wanted smartphones, they would say, 'No. What? Why would I spend money on that?'" he said. Many people were first skeptical of smartphones—they were difficult to use, expensive, intrusive, and some worried about the harms of radiation. But then, "suddenly, they were popular, convenient, a business necessity—[and] people adopted them," Smith said. "When someone is losing their sight or no longer able to drive, when a fifteen-year-old wants to get to his friend's house easier, when people reliant on mass transit realize they can get someplace much quicker," said Smith, "they will embrace these [autonomous vehicles]." Speaking at a symposium hosted in July 2016 by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), Smith said that we may be thinking about the issue of driverless vehicles all wrong. "We should be terrified," he said, "of conventional driving." Credit for image at top: iStock/Chesky_W.

If you ever wrote out a message in code that nobody could read without they knew the decipher rules, you messed around with encryption! That same secret message technique has now been put to a much more worrying use. Google has created multiple AI and they’ve learned how to not only create their own encryption, but are now communicating using messages nobody else can read. This Google Brain project is an experiment in deep learning techniques and involved the use of three neural networks (Alice, Bob, and Eve) created using artificial neurons. These neural nets work like a much simplified version of our brains, and they are slowly and steadily becoming more intelligent. _DJ_ on Flickr The task the Google Brain team set was for Alice to create a simple form of encryption and work with Bob to agree a set of numbers known as a key. Using this key, Bob can read the encrypted messages Alice sent. Meanwhile Eve intercepts the messages and attempts to decipher them. The important thing to remember about neural nets is they continue to learn and adapt, just like us humans do. So while initially the secret message passing didn’t go so well, Alice adapted and got better. Eve was unable to decipher the messages beyond what classes as pure chance. Having two AI communicate using encryption not even us humans can decipher hasn’t happened yet as the encryption is so simple, but there’s every chance it will with enough practice. But why would you want to encourage that to happen? Well, it will likely result in more digital security because different computing systems could allow an AI to handle data transmission using its own encryption only another AI at the destination has a chance of understanding. That would cause hackers a serious, if not insurmountable headache. Of course, it also means we’d be creating a network of highly intelligent AI systems who can chat about and plan whatever they like, and we wouldn’t have a clue what they are going to do until it happened… Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest Reddit AI Artificial Intelligence encryption Google Brain messages neural networks secrets Speak Your Mind More in Tech 11.14.2016 :: 2:15PM EST :: Lee Mathews Tech Take A Peek Inside a Robot Pizza Factory Tech 11.14.2016 :: 12:00PM EST :: Ryan Whitwam Tech Apple May Be Planning a Bigger iPhone 8 Tech 11.12.2016 :: 11:32AM EST :: Lee Mathews Tech Facebook Apologizes For Killing Everyone Tech 11.11.2016 :: 3:00PM EST :: Ryan Whitwam Tech iFixit Tears down the PlayStation 4 pro, Deems It Highly Repairable Tech 11.11.2016 :: 11:15AM EST :: Lee Mathews Tech An Electric Vespa Is Finally In The Works Tech More subscribe to our newsletter: Subscribing to a newsletter indicates your consent to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

The donation was made to the National Park Foundation’s Open OutDoors for Kids program, which supports the National Park Service’s Every Kid In A Park initiative, allowing every fourth grader in the country to get a pass for free entry to National Park Service lands for a year. Because many of those children don’t necessarily have easy transportation to get to those parks, Google’s donation will help them get to some of the most famous parks/recreation areas, including: Yosemite National Park, California: Approximately 400 students will attend multi-day NatureBridge environmental science programs. Golden Gate National Recreational Area, California; Olympic National Park, Washington; and Prince William Forest Park, Virginia: Approximately 200 students will enjoy multi-day experiences at each park. Southern California: In partnership with NatureBridge, the grant will enable approximately 150 students to visit Southern California national parks. Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Ohio: Funding will be combined with Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley support for approximately 250 students to attend All the Rivers Run, a STEM-based residential learning program at the Cuyahoga Valley Environmental Education Center. Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming: Some 100-200 students will attend Teton Science Schools programming late 2016/early 2017. Efforts will be made to connect an entire grade from the Idaho public school system with the park through multi-day environmental science programming. Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina & Tennessee: Some 150 students will attend Tremont Institute outdoor education programming, providing personal, local, and relevant programming that allow youth to live and learn inside the park.

There are several updates in the works that are going to change user experience and optimize local Google Maps searches so local businesses can be discovered and visited more easily. Put simply, the reason that this series of updates is incredibly valuable is because it improves the experience of Google Maps for both the user and the business owner. The business owner is going to be able to advertise and market more directly to local customers, and users are going to have a much easier time finding the businesses and deals in a given area. In this way, both physical and website traffic is bound to increase at your storefront, but only if you take note of these updates and make the necessary strides to get involved with the updates ASAP. In response to the increase in local searches, there are three updates that are going to be making a big impact on user/business experience with Google Maps. Consequently, there are also three ways that you can take advantage of these updates to best serve your business. #1 Utilize Promoted Pins to Advertise Location & Rank First One of the newest features for local search advertisement is the promoted pin. Promoted pins are advertisements tied to your pin location and are intended to increase store business. Google developed these features in response to the increase of local searches, which have grown 50% more than any other kind of mobile searches. Promoted pins utilize a company’s logo to mark it on the map. The company’s logo will only occur if the business decides to buy ad space, but will occur on the physical location as soon as the user does a search. These promoted pins are meant to blend well with the existing regular pins and be streamlined with the existing platform (Google doesn’t want them to be an eyesore). Another bonus of promoted pins is they are marked by a purple pin, instead of a red pin. They will also be the first spot in the organic search results on the app. You might be wondering what happens if there is a lot of competition for this spot, but Google has made it so that only two can actually rank in this position in a local search. This means it will not only be a highly prized position, but it will also gain more user attention. To get started with Promoted Pins, you have to be eligible and you can check to make sure you meet Google criteria by doing the following: Enable location extensions for AdWords Update your Google My Business listing Target a location / address and increase bids for locations near your business Target keywords that relate to your location and what people look up in your area Once you meet Google’s eligibility criteria, you can start thinking about ad payment. Payment is ultimately the same principle behind standard AdWords PPC. If someone interacts with your ad, you pay for it. #2 Create a Business Page to Show What You Have to Offer Promoted pin advertisers will have the opportunity to create and develop customizable business pages. This will give you the chance to provide even more information about store inventory, specials you are running, or other details that are intended to drive business to your store front. These pages will, of course, feature the standard information such as business contact information, but they will also be a way for customers to do things like search store inventory. This is super convenient for users, who can avoid a wasted trip if you don’t have the item in stock. You can think of a business page as a sort of landing page. You should test the page to make sure it is optimized (learn more here), and link back to this page in your writing. It isn’t something you just have in case someone clicks on it when searching for a business on Google–you want to drive people to this page! With the way mobile is growing, this could become one of your most important web pages. Learn more about business page optimization here. #3 Local Search Ads for the Win Local extensions in AdWords currently allow advertisers to target local populations most likely to be interested in their business. The positive thing about these local search ads is they are apparent on both mobile and desktop. In fact, the actual Google Maps app has over 1 billion downloads—meaning that this is by-far one of the most (if not THE most) significant platform for local advertising. This is huge success for an app and many people use Google Maps daily to get directions and to find local businesses. Keep in mind, by being a local advertiser; you have a good chance of ranking within the first two results on a relevant search. This makes local advertising extremely effective, if for nothing else to be one of the highest ranking results on a relevant local search. The Takeaway Google local searches are not fully implemented yet, but these three aspects are something to have on your radar. Get started setting yourself up on Google My Business so you are optimized for local searches so you can begin to advertise just as soon as the feature is released in full. I definitely think since this is a PPC platform, you can feel confident that these local search features are going to be beneficial for advertising and driving business to your doorstep. What do you think about all of the Google Local Search updates? Are you excited for the promoted pins to be released?

By Hope Reese | October 28, 2016 -- 13:38 GMT (06:38 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Image: iStock/Chesky_W This article was originally published on TechRepublic. In March 2015, an Audi SQ5 began its nine-day journey from the Golden Gate Bridge to midtown Manhattan. The 3400-mile drive involved the normal obstacles: construction, highways, city driving, lane-passing. What wasn't involved? Hands on the wheel. Until recently, the concept of a driverless car seemed like the stuff of science fiction. But much has changed in just a few short years as the technology behind autonomous vehicles has taken huge strides. The cross-country driving Audi, powered by technology from Delphi, drove in autonomous mode 99 percent of the time. The US federal government has also begun to embrace autonomous vehicles as a coming reality. In February 2016, the US Department of Transportation (US DOT) announced that it considers the AI powering Google's driverless cars (which have already logged hundreds of thousands of self-driven miles) officially a "driver"--marking a groundbreaking moment in the history of transportation. And in September 2016, the DOT unveiled guidelines for the development of autonomous vehicles, calling it "the most comprehensive national, automated vehicle policy that the world has ever seen." Download this article as a PDF (free registration required). The adoption of driverless vehicles has also come under scrutiny--most notably after the fatal accident that happened in May 2016 when Joshua Brown, operating his Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode, crashed into an 18-wheel tractor trailer. The incident highlighted the complex technological and social hurdles still facing the widespread adoption of driverless vehicles. Since then, Tesla has also released an update to Autopilot, which Elon Musk said would have likely prevented the accident. Despite the debate, one fact is undisputed: Autonomous vehicles are here, and many more are coming. In Singapore and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, self-driving taxis are now shuttling passengers on public roads. By 2020, more than a dozen companies plan to unveil cars with some level of autonomous driving SEE: Autonomous driving levels 0 to 5: Understanding the differences Ford announced its intention to mass-produce fully-autonomous, level 5 vehicles by 2021--that's no steering wheel, no brakes, no human required. According to a report from BI Intelligence, there will be 10 million of them on the road at that point. Why now? So why are the automakers and the government getting on board now? Autonomous driving has a long history--the first form of self-driving cars, powered by a radio antennae, was developed almost a century ago, back in 1925. And some of the technology that is being used today has been around for decades. In 1989, Carnegie Mellon was already using neural networks to control its autonomous vehicles, and by the 1990s, they already had their own vehicle that could drive cross-country. The first form of a self-driving cars, powered by a radio antennae, was developed almost a century ago, in 1925. Image: Radio News, November 1925, americanradiohistory.com However, a variety of factors have combined in recent years to make driverless vehicles ready for wide adoption. Gill Pratt, head of the Toyota Research Institute, part of a $1 billion investment in AI, points to several reasons why. Mobile phones: The explosive growth of mobile technology, the low-powered computer processor, the computer vision chips and cameras, and cell phones in general have become "incredibly inexpensive and ubiquitous." Wireless internet: The rise of 4G networks and WiFi have made it easier than ever to connect. Computer centers in cars: Most new cars today have backup cameras, front and back sensors, and other technologies that help the vehicles detect objects in the environment and alert the driver. Maps: If you're talking about either the navigation system you have in your car, said Pratt, or Google Maps in your phone, digital maps have become really good. Deep learning: Some computers now have "perception at levels of competence close to what a human has," said Pratt. "The car can look out on the world and tell the difference between a bicycle and a person that's walking, and a tree and a parking meter--and it can then classify them either almost as well as we can, or in some cases, even a little bit better." "The technology has finally become mature," said Jeffrey Miller, IEEE member and associate professor of engineering at the University of Southern California. Although vehicles have been equipped with intelligent features for the past couple of decades, such as pop-up headlights, automatic seatbelts, adaptive cruise control, lane correction, and more, the technology is now becoming "better, more reliable, and more cost-effective." Tech hurdles But even with these great leaps forward, fully-autonomous cars are several years off. There are still software and mechanical hurdles to overcome, and different companies are taking different approaches to testing out new technology. For example, Google is still updating software on a near-daily basis, said Miller. And some companies are still negotiating the balance (and tradeoff) of power that happens when the driver needs to regain control of the car. "We have decided not to let 'perfect' be the enemy of the 'better.' Instead, we will release 'better' as soon as it is available." — Tesla spokesperson Jim McBride, autonomous vehicles expert at Ford, said that his company will be skipping Level 3, which involves transferring control from car to human, to get straight to Level 4, with no driver required. "We're not going to ask the driver to instantaneously intervene," said McBride. "That's not a fair proposition." Bryant Walker Smith, professor at the University of South Carolina, also sees a major problem with Level 3. "If there's a hazard on the road and if the driver doesn't re-engage, the system doesn't have to do anything about it," he said "That's a very scary design prospect." Environmental factors are a concern as well. Navigating tricky situations at stop signs, figuring out what to do when unknown variables like animals run into the road or driving safely in bad weather can be problematic. Most systems, said Smith, have not yet been tested in snow. Despite these barriers, Tesla has taken a unique approach when it comes to integrating new technology. A Tesla representative told TechRepublic that the company is "disruptive, in the original sense of the word." "We have decided not to let 'perfect' be the enemy of the 'better,'" the Tesla rep said. "Instead, we will release 'better' as soon as it is available." Regulatory hurdles In addition to technical and safety questions, Federal and state regulations are also still being worked out. But the Federal government is not sitting idly by. In January 2016, the Obama administration announced a plan to invest nearly $4 billion into research for autonomous driving. And a groundbreaking announcement by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the following month allowed for the AI system controlling Google's self-driving car to be considered a driver, in response to the company's proposal to the NHTSA in November 2015. In September 2016, the DOT announced the first-ever guidelines for autonomous driving. Some states currently have specific laws that would ban autonomous driving--the state of New York, for instance, does not allow any hands-free driving. Without clear regulations, testing self-driving cars is a challenge. And although a few states--California, Nevada, Florida, and Michigan--currently allow autonomous vehicles on the road, California is the only one with licensing regulations at this point. Miller told TechRepublic he thinks it's because of the pressure Silicon Valley puts on lobbyists in California. "They're lobbying the legislature, saying 'hey, you've gotta do something,'" said Miller. "And California doesn't want Google to go to another state to get help." But without specific regulations, many questions remain unanswered. Autonomous driving is poised to shake up the entire car insurance industry, for example, and there are still many unanswered questions when it comes to liability. What will licensing look like? Will new drivers still be required to get traditional licenses, even if they aren't behind the wheel? What about young people, or older people with disabilities? What will be required to operate these new vehicles? Governments need to work quickly to catch up with tech. Auto regulations are some of the strictest--and obviously for good reason, since public safety is on the line. Where will we see them first? So where will we first start seeing driverless cars? Again, Singapore now has self-driving taxis in a limited area of the city, and Uber has unveiled its own driverless fleet in Pittsburgh. But these cars are still operated by safety engineers behind the wheel, taking notes. Ford's CEO has said that its own driverless cars will likely start out in ride-sharing fleets. And Tesla's updated Masterplan also highlights its intention to weave shared vehicles into the mix. Uber released a self-driving test fleet on the streets of Pittsburgh, PA, in September 2016. Image: Uber But beyond this, the answer is still unclear. Many predict that the trucking industry will be massively disrupted by driverless technology. Miller predicts that in the next five years, the first vehicles will be high-end luxury models bought by consumers. And who we see owning them will depend, in a large part, on where we're looking. "It's a cultural/societal issue whether it's accepted," Miller said. "There are countries in Europe where public transportation is the primary means of getting around--so car sharing will be popular." But in places like LA? "Car ownership is a big part of what's ingrained in society... it could take more time." Who's in the lead? Wondering who's in the front of the race right now? While companies like Tesla and Google have gotten a lot of press lately, it's still too early to tell. "This is still an emerging technology," said Thilo Koslowski, former vice president and automotive practice leader at Gartner. Miller agrees: "The big players right now may not be the big players in a few years." Ford says it will release self-driving cars in 2021. And Tesla says its level 5, fully-autonomous cars will be ready in 2018--and in October, announced that every Tesla in production will now have the hardware to be capable of self-driving. Beyond the question of who will be first, Koslowski isn't sure that kind of comparison makes sense, anyway. Why? Once the technology is perfected, companies like Google will be looking for partners. Also, "anybody who's working on this helps the entire category," Koslowski said. Consumers aren't necessarily looking to buy the first model to hit the market, either. Economist Adam Grant makes a good argument for why it can be smart to wait until after the first version is out. "There's a learning curve and a trust factor that needs to be considered," said Koslowski. Trust issues At the heart of the driverless car question is consumer acceptance. While the technology factor is necessary to get these vehicles on the road, how to make these vehicles work is just one part of the equation. The second, Koslowski told TechRepublic, is "rethinking the entire car culture we've built over the past century." The experience of driving is about to radically change in a world of self-driving cars. And the issue of trust will be central to the adoption of the new technology. According to Koslowski, the societal aspect is the real hurdle. Miller agrees. "The core challenge," he said, "is determining whether the relevant technologies have reached a demonstrated level of socially acceptable risk." So what is a socially-acceptable level of risk? According to Koslowski, Smith, and others, it depends on a public understanding that these cars will not be flawless. But that's not an easy thing for many people to get their heads around. "This is the first robot that we will experience on a day-to-day basis," he said. "Loss of control and trust is what a lot of people have problems with. All of a sudden we're delegating a task that consumers have been doing for a century to a robot." The dashboard of Tesla's Autopilot. Drivers in Autopilot mode, which is in beta as of October 2016, are required to keep hands on the wheel and remain alert while Autopilot is engaged. Image: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg via Getty Images While working as Senior Advisor for Innovation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Alec Ross, author of Industries of the Future, traveled to 41 countries. He observed a deeply-ingrained distrust of robots, particular in Western society. According to Ross, the concept of robots carry "cultural baggage" that may not be easy to shake. "How quickly can we get consumers to feel comfortable and want these technologies?" asks Koslowski. The answer depends on how realistic we are, he said. Although safety is predicted to improve significantly, with an expected 80% reduction in accidents by 2040, the idea of "safety" may need to be redefined, shifting from driver to software. According to Smith, new areas of concern could include technical failures, related to bugs, as well as security vulnerabilities--cybersecurity will become a major concern when these cars hit the road. Still, the danger posed by cybersecurity attacks "pales in comparison to the carnage on the road today," said Smith. "I'm concerned about the vulnerability of vehicles, but I'm terrified about today's drivers in today's vehicles." There are about 32,000 fatalities per year due to auto accidents in the United States (the average number peaked at around 55,000 per year in the early 1970s), according to data from the NHTSA. Over 90% of those accidents are caused by human error, as reported in multiple studies. But even with the assumption that safety will improve, the combination of technical uncertainties with cultural baggage in the western world make it likely that we will have a low tolerance for error when it comes to safety in autonomous vehicles. Many people may find it more forgivable for a human to make a mistake on the road than the computer that's in charge. Smith predicted that "the first crash, the first injuries and fatalities, will be a big deal." A Tesla spokesperson echoed this point. "Any given regulator will be crucified for an issue with a feature or technology they approved that had a bug." The predictions were proven correct after influential publications like the New York Times portrayed the Tesla Autopilot crash in a critical way without taking the whole context into consideration. In that case, a major hurdle was understanding the difference between Tesla's Autopilot feature--which is more of an advanced cruise control--and a fully-autonomous car, which doesn't require the attention of the driver. The open road So perhaps the greatest challenge will be getting society on board--literally. Driving cars is deeply ingrained in American culture. There's a romanticism about getting on the open road for the first time. "Most of us grew up thinking of freedom as a steering wheel and a learner's permit," said journalist Pagan Kennedy. "I vividly remember the first time I stomped on a gas pedal and zoomed out onto a highway; the car pounced with such force that I was thrown back in the seat. That sensation is still burned into my mind." "Most of us grew up thinking of freedom as a steering wheel and a learner's permit." — Pagan Kennedy, journalist Letting go of the wheel will undoubtedly require a culture shift, letting go of the nostalgia. And when it comes to entrusting a self-driving vehicle to keep them safe, people have varying levels of comfort. When asked how they would feel about riding in a driverless vehicle, some respondents, like Anna Munoz, executive assistant at CBS Interactive in San Francisco, gave a flat-out "No." Ms. Munoz, presumably like many others, trusts herself over a self-driving car. "Nothing would get me to try it," she said. Others are open to it--just not quite yet. Joe Jones, co-founder of iRobot, is willing to let a car take over if something goes wrong, yet still feels that "self driving cars haven't yet achieved the level of reliability where I'd be comfortable without a fail-safe mechanism." And Helen Greiner, CEO of CyPhy Works, a drone company, also has mixed feelings. "I'd be comfortable driving if I had the ability to grab the wheel--in few years," said Greiner. "If I'm going to be in the backseat and the car's fully driving, I think it's going to take me a little bit longer." Still, some are perfectly comfortable ceding control. Roman Yampolskiy, director of Cyber Security Laboratory at the University of Louisville, puts it this way: "I had the 'privilege' of being driven by teenagers and seniors, and would pay good money to have an AI drive me instead." Joanne Pransky, the self-dubbed "robot psychiatrist," echoed the sentiment: "What could be more life-threatening than sitting as a passenger in a car being driven by a distracted teen in training? Self-driving cars can't come soon enough!" And despite her romantic memories of the open road, Kennedy would also "let a robot take control." "I am terrible driver," she said. "Just ask my boyfriend." But whether fully-autonomous driving arrives in two years or five, there is no doubt that it is close--and no doubt that it will radically alter the way we live. We could use smartphones as an analogy, said Smith. "If you went back 15 years and asked people if they wanted smartphones, they would say, 'No. What? Why would I spend money on that?'" he said. Many people were first skeptical of smartphones--they were difficult to use, expensive, intrusive, and some worried about the harms of radiation. But then, "suddenly, they were popular, convenient, a business necessity--[and] people adopted them," Smith said. "When someone is losing their sight or no longer able to drive, when a fifteen-year-old wants to get to his friend's house easier, when people reliant on mass transit realize they can get someplace much quicker," said Smith, "they will embrace these [autonomous vehicles]." Speaking at a symposium hosted in July 2016 by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), Smith said that we may be thinking about the issue of driverless vehicles all wrong. "We should be terrified," he said, "of conventional driving." Join Discussion Powered by Livefyre Add your Comment Related Stories After Hours Anxious? Depressed?

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Security FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Number of Malicious Links Accessible Through Google & Twitter Goes Up GO Search engines failing at detecting and flagging malware Oct 28, 2016 13:20 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Twitter, Google, and other search engines such as Bing, Yandex, and Faroo are increasingly flooded with malware, according to trends tracked by the AV-TEST laboratory. The team of researchers says they've tested 80 million links found in search engine results in 2015, and another 81 million in 2016. The results of this scan revealed the presence of malicious content in 18,280 sites in 2015, and in 29,632 sites in 2016. Historical tests from 2013, when AV-TEST examined 40 million sites, clocked malware URLs at only 5,060 sites, showing a continuous growth for the past years. Google Safe Browsing falls short when flagging malicious links For the 2015 and 2016 tests, AV-TEST also says it double-checked the results of its internal scanning system against Google's Safe Browing API, which they say failed to identify all threats. In 2015, for the 18,280 sites AV-TEST discovered, Google flagged only 9,725 results, while in 2016 Google Safe Browsing had a better batting average of 19,794 warnings out of 29,632 malicious links. EXE files are the most common method of delivering malware But there are different types of malicious content found on these links, such as tech support scams, phishing pages, or sites pushing malware-laced downloads. When it comes to the latter category, which includes sites pushing actual, downloadable malware, AV-TEST says that 60 percent of these threats tried to start a direct file download just as the user landed on the site, while the rest tried to execute code snippets, or use Flash or Java exploits, reminiscent of exploit kits. The top five of the most commonly pushed file types includes EXE files,  ZIP and RAR archives, SWF Flash objects, and MSI installers, in this order. Twitter also affected Besides search engines, AV-TEST says it also analyzed tweets shared on Twitter. Experts stated that they scanned over 315 million tweets in 2015 and another 200 million in 2016. Despite the smaller number of links analyzed in 2016, AV-TEST says it found 1,500 links leading to malware threats, while it only found 1,100 malicious links in 2015. "It is important to point out that search engine operators are not virus hunters," said Maik Morgenstern, CTO of AV-TEST GmbH. "It is an additional job that they do not perform entirely on a voluntary basis."

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Google announces $7 billion buyback after successful third quarter By Anthony Spadafora After beating analysts expectations during its third quarter, Google has announced a $7 billion buyback. Shares Google has announced that it has authorised a new $7 billion stock repurchase after it was able to beat Wall Street's projections during it third quarter. The company's mobile and video ad sales were what contributed to its increased earnings this quarter with a net revenue of 18.3 billion which was higher than the $18 billion that analysts were expecting. Google's net revenue was up by 21 per cent when compared to the same time period last year. The company's Other Bets division also lost less money with a loss of $840 million compared to last year's $980 million. This division was even able to earn $197 million which is higher than where it stood in the previous year with earnings of $141 million. Google's Other Bets have been criticised recently due to a number of executive departures and less investment from its parent company Alphabet.  This division accounts for the company's more risky ventures which includes its high-speed Fiber service, Nest's smart home technology and other emerging technologies. On Tuesday, Google Fiber announced that it would halt plans to expand into other US cities and that it would lay off nine per cent of its staff.  The company's CFO Ruth Porat explained that it would still work to bring high-speed internet to more homes but would continue to do so through new wireless technologies. Porat offered further insight on how Google's moonshots will operate under Alphabet's corporate structure, saying: “As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way and that some efforts will be more successful than others.” Currently Google has over $80 billion in cash and securities and now is an excellent time for the company to announce a buyback. The company's latest buyback is larger than the $5 billion buyback that it announced last year. Google will be dividing the stock purchases so that they take place on the open market as well as through privately negotiated deals.     Image Credit: Denis Linine / Shutterstock ABOUT THE AUTHOR Anthony Spadafora Anthony currently resides in South Korea where he teaches and experiences Korean technological advances first hand.

Pushbullet Allows Users to See and Send Google Allo Messages from PC Messages can also be sent from Android phones Oct 28, 2016 13:16 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Pushbullet is a neat service that allows users to connect their devices and send or receive SMS messages from their computers. It works with multiple popular applications including WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and Pushbullet creators have just announced that they added a new feature to the service. Google Allo users can now send and receive messages from their PCs using Pushbullet. Google’s latest messaging application doesn’t have a desktop version, which means that Pushbullet’s new feature will surely be very useful to users. Allo already comes with the ability to quickly reply from notifications and the new Pushbullet update makes use of this feature when adding Allo support. In order to view and send Google Allo messages from the computer, users need to have the latest versions of both Allo and Pushbullet installed on their devices. In addition, users would need to enable Notification Mirroring after signing in to the Android app in order to get started. When receiving a message through Allo, a notification shade will appear on the Android phone and Pushbullet will also display the same notification on the computer. Users simply need to click Reply, type in their message and press send from the computer. Just yesterday, Allo received an update with direct reply and split-screen support. The latter feature would allow users to keep the Allo app on top, while working in another application at the bottom of the screen. The split-screen mode is activated by simply long-pressing on the recent apps button on the device.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Google#Allo#Pushbullet#Desktop service#Android reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Pushbullet lets users send Allo message on PC (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Assistant Channel Available on IFTTT for Android Google Messenger Update Brings a Compact UI and New Circular Icons Allo Developer Lists 7 Most Requested Features, Including SMS Support WhatsApp Could Incorporate Passcodes and Recovery Email Options OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon 2 photos    Pushbullet New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   Samsung Announces Android 7.0 Nougat for the Galaxy S7/S7 edge more on: Samsung Galaxy S7 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Steve Dent , @stevetdent 10.28.16 in Internet Comments 987 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Google is trying hard to get folks using its AI-gifted Allo messenger service, so it has jumped on a popular Netflix show. It has revealed some Stranger Things tie-ins for Halloween, including a sticker pack and an AI-assisted scavenger hunt. If you're in New York City today (October 28th) and want to participate, you just ask Google Assistant "Where is Barb," a reference to the character who just kind of ... disappeared from the show. That'll reveal the first location (Lafayette & Grand in Soho) where you'll see a sticker wall instructing you to "use your powers" in Allo, Google says. Your AI sidekick will then tell you where to find a "mind-control vending machine" by dropping a so-called suggestion chip that you tap, directing you to a new, undisclosed Google Maps location. With some luck, you can claim a prize like a BMX bike, Pentax camera or a Panasonic boombox. You can also download a Stranger Things sticker pack with artwork inspired by the show (above). Google is no doubt hoping like hell that all of this will entice you to try the app, since a lot of folks are probably unaware that it even exists. As a reminder, it's a messaging service with a built-in conversational "Assistant" bot that can give you information whether you're chatting with it directly or in a conversation with pals. For example, it can give you advice on restaurants, movies, the weather and more. The company does have some actual news about the app besides the PR-inspired stickers and treasure hunt. You're now able to reply to messages directly from your notifications, saving you the trouble of going into the app. Google also added new Android N features, including a split-screen mode and app shortcuts. iOS users, meanwhile, can doodle on photos before sharing them with friends.

This week, good news for YouTubers but bad news for Vine stars and anyone who wants a bit of privacy. Twitter kills Vine Sad news for those with short attention spans, Twitter is killing off Vine, the six second video app it purchased a couple of years ago. According to a statement, despite discontinuing the app in the coming months, your Vines will still be available. “You’ll be able to access and download your Vines. We’ll be keeping the website online because we think it’s important to still be able to watch all the incredible Vines that have been made. You will be notified before we make any changes to the app or website.” On the plus side, Twitter’s been far more entertaining for the last 24 hours than normal. Enjoy it while it lasts. Bing Ads reveal the most searched Halloween costumes According to the latest research from Bing Ads, adults are more interested in performing Halloween searches than teenagers, although that may change as teenagers have even less to do on the internet now (see above). Here’s some more spooky insight: 32% of the searches were made from people aged 35-49 and 28% of them were made from people aged 50-64. This is probably the reason why 72% of the searches occurred on PCs, with just 14% of them taking place on both tablet and mobile devices. Teens aged 13 to 17 are 473% more likely to search for Pokémon, compared to young adults aged 18 to 24. Young adults aged 18 to 24 are 8% more likely to search for Little Mermaid than Deadpool. Adults aged 25 to 34 are 10% more likely to search for Deadpool than Little Mermaid. Adults aged 35 to 49 are 242% more likely to search for Harry Potter, at least compared to 25-34-year-olds. Baby Boomers and Gen Xers aged 50 to 64 are 8% more likely to search for Alice in Wonderland than Pokémon. Older Baby Boomers aged over 65 are both likely to search for Five Nights at Freddy’s and Deadpool. No word as to why nobody in the US dresses as anything remotely terrifying during Halloween. Come on, zombie-up that Little Mermaid costume just for this year! Google comes under fire for its privacy policy change As reported this week by Al Robert, Google made a change to its privacy policy that’s now drawing criticism from privacy proponents. As detailed by ProPublica, Google “quietly erased [the] last privacy line in the sand” by allowing for data it collects on its services to be combined with DoubleClick. Previously, Google’s privacy policy read: “We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.” That was replaced with: “Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.” According to ProPublica’s Julia Angwin, “The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.” By default, all users who create a Google account post-privacy policy change are opted in to data sharing and must opt out if they don’t want their data shared. Those who already have accounts must opt in.

Five most important search marketing news stories of the week ​How young marketers can impact digital strategies Bing Ads provides all new campaign creation workflow Bing Ads has unveiled an all new campaign creation workflow designed to help you optimise search campaigns on its network. Here’s a brief guide to the new features: Establish a business goal to guide your campaign’s creation You can select a marketing goal for your new campaign, which will be used to recommend different features or different defaults to launch your campaigns. Regardless of which goal you choose, your campaign will still have access to all features. Copy campaign settings & target specific locations You can now quickly copy the campaign settings from an existing campaign. You can also set up the locations where you want your ads to appear. Target the right searchers with tailored keyword recommendations Bing Ads now offers improved keyword suggestions to help you target the right search results. These suggestions can even be based on a URL from your website. For each suggestion, Bing Ads will show how popular, how costly, and how competitive each keyword is. YouTube rolls out ‘end screens’ for every user YouTube has announced a new feature that lets you add a thumbnail overlay to the end of your videos, called an end screen. This is described as a “new mobile-friendly tool that lets you engage viewers right as your video finishes and encourages them to watch more on their devices.” For the last 5-20 seconds of your video, you can add a thumbnail overlay that tells viewers to watch other videos, subscribe to your channel, visit collaborators’ channels, and more. This is apparently easier to use than its current desk-top only tool, Annotations. And to end the round-up, let’s finish with an appropriate end screen of our own.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 15, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Interview: Can you forecast SEO? Sastry Rachakonda says you can Analytics Industry SEO 28 Oct 16 | Rebecca Sentance Facebook0 Linkedin54 Google+10 Twitter 64 In the world of search engine optimisation, there are a wealth of tools which produce analytics and SEO reports after changes have been made to your site. But what if you could predict how your site’s ranking would change before you’d made any alterations –and see the impact on traffic, ROI and more? Sounds too good to be true, right? But ALPS, a new platform from iQuanti, sets out to do exactly that. ALPS, which stands for Analytics Led Platform for Search, is a “best-in-class analytically driven platform”, in the words of CEO Sastry Rachakonda. The platform “allows you to set your SEO strategy with a deep understanding of your competition as well as your business.” The aim of the platform’s predictive capabilities is to let SEOs understand exactly what impact a certain change to their site would have, before they invest the money and time in making it. But it also gives an in-depth insight into exactly what competitor websites are doing with their SEO, allowing users to adapt their strategy accordingly. So how does this tool actually work, and how accurate is it really? I asked CEO Sastry Rachakonda for some insight. A gap in the market As you might imagine, a platform like ALPS is built on an in-depth knowledge of SEO, a lot of data, and a lot of research. “I used to be a marketer in large Fortune 500 companies,” explains Rachakonda. “Having looked at the SEO space from the other side, I found there were a lot of gaps in the existing tools, and that was pretty much the genesis of ALPS.” Existing SEO platforms have a good level of analytics and reporting, says Rachakonda, but as of yet, nothing predictive. Building a tool like ALPS practically required Rachakonda and his team to build their own search engine – or at least to understand how the theory behind them works. They plumbed the industry research and patents available – including a number filed by Google – in order to understand the factors that go into making a search engine. “At the core of ALPS is a desire to get a deeper understanding of how the algorithms work,” explains Rachakonda. Image by iQuanti Using this knowledge, they were able to build a model which could simulate how a search engine would respond to various changes on a website, and alter the site ranking accordingly. The ALPS tool uses 105 different factors to model search rankings and predict SEO. While this might sound pretty complex, Google is rumoured to use between 150 and 180. Of course, Google has a lot of internal data at its fingertips which outside parties could never hope to replicate, much of it accumulated over decades of learning and tweaking. But iQuanti did its best with the information that was available, and while some of it was purchased, a surprising amount is publicly available for anyone to use. ALPS aims to replicate Google’s search algorithms as closely as possible, but it works for other search engines as well. “We looked at Google primarily because that has the most volume, but the variables remain the same,” says Rachakonda. “There isn’t a dramatic difference between search engines. In our roadmap, we are looking at tweaking it to come up with a secondary model that will more accurately replicate Bing’s search engine ranking.” While the platform obviously can’t match Google one hundred percent, it comes pretty close, says Rachakonda – and it’s the most extensively-researched and modelled tool of its kind. “Is it perfect? No, but I would say this is the most far-reaching effort in that direction, and we have been successful in driving results.” Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin54 Google+10 Twitter 64 Related articles Google’s mobile-first index: how to prepare your business Are you asking for too much information on web forms? Five most important search marketing news stories of the week How Black Friday can lead to valuable organic search opportunities From art to science At the core of ALPS is its scoring engine: the higher your score, the better your SEO. The ‘ALPS score’ is made up of four components: on-page, off-page, social and technical SEO. The platform also gives you your Google search ranking for a particular keyword – users can choose the keywords they want to target when they onboard with the platform. You can then compare your SEO score in various areas with competitors who rank above and below you for the same keyword, see what they’re doing better than you (such as having better on-page SEO), and use the tool’s predictive function to forecast how altering different parts of your site will affect your score. Image by iQuanti Of course, SEO nowadays isn’t just a keyword game, and a lot of the factors that are now key to SEO rankings are more subjective and difficult to quantify – like content quality. So how does ALPS account for changes to something like the quality of your site’s content? Ajay Rama, Senior Vice President of Product at iQuanti, explains, “There are two aspects to content quality that we look at: A, if the page is relevant and meeting the primary purpose it was meant to serve; and B, whether the content is from an authoritative or trustworthy source. “Our algorithm analyses the purpose by looking at the mix of terms that are being used and not just exact word combinations. It looks at synonyms and topically similar words. It also looks at whether the links that the site is getting are provided in the same context as the page content, and then assigns a relevancy score to it. “To determine the trustworthiness of a site, we look at the nature of links that the content has, and whether they are from trusted sources or domains.” ALPS also has a dedicated section for mobile SEO, which looks at how pages and keywords rank differently in mobile search compared to desktop. Another feature that many SEOs would find handy is its ability to account for Google penalties for something like failing to nofollow ‘freebie’ links by bloggers. So you can simulate the impact of disavowing various links on your site, and then watch your ranking respond accordingly. Why has there been so little development in the predictive SEO space? | Image by nvodicka, available via CC0 The ability to simulate how changes to your SEO will affect your ranking before you make them is obviously incredibly handy in the search industry. So why aren’t more companies doing this? I asked Rachakonda why he thinks there has been so little development in the realm of predictive SEO. “It requires a combination of strong, data-driven folks, engineering, as well as strong marketers – typically, a lot of tools come from very strong engineering companies, but I think that there is a strong overlay of marketing and data science that you need [for SEO],” he replied. “SEO is a bit of an art. A lot of times, the investment in paid search is much more than in SEO, because of how predictable paid search is. And we hope that we can transform the industry with this tool, by making SEO a lot more predictable and results-driven. “Could others do it? Obviously – but this is the first, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there are followers. This is a space that is really ripe for innovation, and for really making data work a lot more. This is one of those corners of digital marketing that is still very much an art, not as much a science, and hopefully this tool will take a big step towards making this a lot more of a science.” Want to stay on top of the latest search trends?Get top insights and news from our search experts.

Skip to content Dennis Forbes Technology and software development Optical vs Electronic Image Stabilization The recently unveiled Google Pixel smartphones features electronic image stabilization in lieu of optical image stabilization, with Google reps offering up some justifications for their choice. While there is some merit to their arguments, the contention that optical image stabilization is primarily for photos is inaccurate, and is at odds with the many excellent video solutions that feature optical image stabilization, including the competing iPhone 7. Add that video is nothing more than a series of pictures, a seemingly trite observation that will have apparent relevance later in this piece. This post is an attempt to explain stabilization techniques and their merits and detriments. Why should you listen to me? I have some degree of expertise on this topic. Almost two years ago I created an app for Android1 that featured gyroscope-driven image stabilization, with advanced perspective correction and rolling shutter compensation. It offers sensor-driven Electronic Image Stabilization for any Android device (with Android 4.4+ and a gyroscope). It was long the only app that did this for Android (and to my knowledge remains the only third-party app to do it). Subsequent releases of Android included extremely rudimentary EIS functionality in the system camera. Now with the Google Pixel, Google has purportedly upgraded the hardware, paid attention to the necessity of reliable timing, and offered a limited version for that device. They explain why they could accomplish it with some hardware upgrades- “We have a physical wire between the camera module and the hub for the accelerometer, the gyro, and the motion sensors,” Knight explains. “That makes it possible to have very accurate time-sensing and synchronization between the camera and the gyro.” We’re talking about gyroscope data triggering 200 times per second, and frames of video in the 30 times per second range. The timing sensitivity is in the 5ms range (that the event sources are timestamped within that range of accuracy). This is a trivial timing need and should need no special hardware upgrades to be accomplished. The iPhone has had rock solid gyroscope timing information going back many generations, along with rock solid image frame timing. It simply wasn’t a need for Google, so the poor design of the timing insanity was the foundation of data on Android (and let me be clear that I’m very pro-Android. I’m pro all non-murdery technology, really. This isn’t advocacy or flag-waving for some alternative: it’s just an irritation that something so simple became so troublesome and wasted so much of my time). Everyone is getting in on the EIS stabilization game now, including Sony, one of the pioneers of OIS, with several of their new smartphones, and even GoPro with their latest device (their demos again under the blazing midday sun, and still they’re unimpressive). EIS lets you use a cheaper, thinner, less complex imaging module, reducing the number of moving parts (so better yields and reliability over time. Speaking of which, I’ve had two SLR camera bodies go bad because the stabilized sensor system broke in some way). A number of post-processing options have also appeared (e.g. using only frame v frame evaluations to determine movement and perspective), including Microsoft’s stabilization solution, and the optional solution built right into YouTube. There are some great white papers covering the topic of stabilization . Let’s get to stabilization techniques and how EIS compares with OIS. With optical image stabilization, a gyro sensor package is coupled with the imaging sensor. Some solutions couple this with some electromagnets to move the lens, other solutions move the sensor array, while the best option (there are optical consequences of moving the lens or sensor individually, limiting the magnitude before there are negative optical effects) moves the entire lens+sensor assembly (frequently called “module tilt”), as if it were on a limited range gimbal. And there are actual gimbals2 that can hold your imaging device and stabilize it via gyroscope directed motors. A 2-axis OIS solution corrects for minor movements of tilt or yaw — e.g. tilting the lens down or up, or tilting to the sides — the Nexus 5 came with 2-axis stabilization, although it was never well used by the system software, and later updates seem to have simply disabled it altogether. More advanced solutions add rotation (roll), which is twisting the camera, upping it to a 3-axis solution. The pinnacle is 5-axis which also incorporate accelerometer readings and compensates for minor movements left or right, up and down. EIS also comes in software 2-, 3- and 5-axis varieties: Correlate the necessary sensor readings with the captured frames and correct accordingly. My app is 3-axis (adding the lateral movements was too unreliable across devices, not to mention that while rotational movements could be very accurately corrected and perspective adjusted, the perspective change of lateral movements is a non-trivial consideration, and most implementations are naive). With an OIS solution the module is trying to fix on a static orientation so long as it concludes that any movement is unintended and variations fall within its range of movement. As you’re walking and pointing down the street, the various movements are cancelled out as the lens or sensor or entire module does corrective counter-movements. Built-in modules have a limited degree of correction — one to two degrees in most cases, so you still have to be somewhat steady, but it can make captures look like you’re operating a steadicam. An OIS solution does not need to crop to apply corrections, and doesn’t need to maintain any sort of boundary buffer area. The downside, however, is that the OIS system is trying to guess, in real time, the intentions of movements, and will often initially cancel out the onset of intentional movements: As you start to pan the OIS system will often counteract the motion, and then rapidly try to “catch up” and move back to the center sweet spot where it has the maximum range of motion for the new orientation. The imaging sensor in OIS solutions is largely looking at a static scene, mechanically kept aligned. With an EIS solution, in contrast, the sensor is fixed, and is moving as the user moves. As the user vibrates around and sways back and forth, and so on, that is what the camera is capturing. The stabilization is then applied either in real-time, or as a post-processing step. A real-time EIS system often maintains a fixed cropping to maintain a buffer area (e.g. only a portion of the frame is recorded, allowing the active capture area to move around within the buffer area without changing digital zoom levels), and as with OIS solution it predictively tries to infer the intentions of movements. From the demo video Google gave, their system is real-time (or with a minimal number of buffer frames), yielding the displeasing shifts as it adjusts from being fixed on one orientation to transitioning to the next fixed orientation (presumably as range of movement started to push against the edge of the buffer area), rather than smoothly panning between. A sensor-driven post-processing EIS system, which is what Gallus is, captures the original recording as is, correlating the necessary sensor data and using attributes of the device (focal length, sensor size, field of views, etc) in post processing can evaluate the motion with a knowledge of the entire sequence, using low-pass filters and other smoothing techniques to make a movement spline within the set variability allowance. Let’s start with an illustrative sample. Moments before writing this entry, the sun beginning to set on what was already a dreary, dim day, I took a walk in the back of the yard with my app, shooting a 4K video on my Nexus 6p. Here it is (it was originally recorded in h265 and was transcoded to h264, and then YouTube did its own re-encoding, so some quality was lost) – This is no “noon in San Francisco” or “ride on the ferry” sort of demo. It’s terrible light, subjects are close to the camera (and thus have a high rate of relative motion in frame during movements) and the motions are erratic and extreme, though I was actually trying to be stable. Here’s what Gallus — an example of sensor-driven post-processing EIS — yielded when it stabilized the result. I included some of the Gallus instrumentation for my own edification. Having that sort of informational overlay on a video is an interesting concern because it conflicts with systems that do frame-v-frame stabilization. Next up is YouTube and their frame-v-frame stabilization. YouTube did a pretty good job, outside of the random zooming and jello effect that appears in various segments. But ultimately this is not intending to be a positive example of Gallus. Quite the opposite, I’m demonstrating exactly what is wrong with EIS: Where it fails, and why you should be very wary of demonstrations that always occur under perfect conditions. And this is a problem that is common across all EIS solutions. A video is a series of photos. While some degree of motion blur in a video is desirable when presented as is, with all of the original movements, as humans we have become accustomed to blur correlating with motion — a subject is moving, or the frame is moving (as an aside, this is the same reason tilt-shift photography looks small: We are acclimated to the depth of field ranges of normal photography). We filter it out, and if you watch the original unstabilized video, you likely didn’t notice that a significant percentage of the frames were blurry messes (pause at random frames), courtesy of the lower-light induced longer shutter times mixed with device movements. Stabilize that video, however, and motion blur of a stabilized frame3 is very offputting. Which is exactly what is happening above: Gallus is stabilizing the frame perfectly, but many of the frames it is stabilizing were captured during rapid motion (at high hyperlapse rates it tries to pick frames with lower velocities for this reason if multiple frames fall within the time window), and given that a video is a series of photos, those individual frames are a mess. Frames blurred by imaging device movement are fine when presented in their original form, but are terrible when the motion is removed. This is the enormous downside of EIS compared to OIS — individual OIS frames are usually ideal under even challenging conditions (such as the fading sun of a dreary fall day) — captured with the stability of individual photos — whereas EIS is working with often seriously compromised source material. Google added some image processing to ameliorate the lack of OIS for individual photos — taking a sequence of very short shutter time photos in low light, minimizing photographer motion, and then trying to tease out a usable image from the noise — but this isn’t possible when shooting video. An EIS system could try to avoid this problem by using very short exposure times (which itself yields a displeasing strobe light effect) and wide apertures or higher, noisier ISOs, but ultimately it is simply a compromise. To yield a usable result other elements of image capture had to be sacrificed. “But the Pixel surely does it better than your little app!” you confidently announce (though they’re doing exactly the same process), sitting on your Pixel order and hoping that advocacy will change reality. As someone who has more skin in this game than anyone heralding whatever their favorite device happens to have, I will guarantee you that the EIS stabilization in the Pixel will be mediocre to unusable in challenging conditions (though the camera will naturally be better than the Nexus 6p, each iteration generally improving upon the last, and is most certainly spectacular in good conditions). Here’s a review of the iPhone 7 (shot with an iPhone 7), and I’ll draw your attention to the ~1:18 mark — as they walk with the iPhone 7, the frame is largely static with little movement, and is clear and very usable courtesy of OIS (they combine minimal electronic stabilization with OIS, but ultimately the question is the probability that static elements of the scene are capturing the majority of a frame’s shutter time on a fixed set of image sensors, and OIS vastly improves the odds). As they pan left, pause and view those frames. Naturally, given the low light, with significant relative movement of the scene it’s a blurry mess. On the Pixel every frame will be like this under that sort of situation presuming the absence of inhuman stability or an external stabilizer. I’m not trying to pick specifically on the Pixel, and it otherwise looks like a fantastic device (and would be my natural next device, having gone through most Nexus devices back to the Nexus One, which replaced my HTC Magic/HTC Dream duo), but in advocating their “an okay compromise in some situations” solution, they went a little too far with the bombast. Claiming that OIS is just for photos is absurd in the way they intended it, though perhaps it is true if you consider a video a series of photos, as I observed at the outset. A good OIS solution is vastly superior to the best possible EIS solution. There is no debate about this. EIS is the cut-rate, discount, make-the-best-of-a-bad-situation compromise. That the Pixel lacks OIS might be fine on the streets of San Francisco at noon, but it’s going to be a serious impediment during that Halloween walk, in Times Square at night, or virtually anywhere else where the conditions aren’t ideal. The bar for video capture has been raised. Even for single frame photography, any test that uses static positioning is invalid at the outset: It doesn’t matter if the lens and sensor yield perfect contrast and color if it’s only in the artificial scenario where the camera and subject are both perfectly still, when in the real world the camera will always be swaying around and vibrating in someone’s hands. Subjects moving in frame of course will yield similar motion blur on both solutions, but that tends to be a much smaller problem in real world video imaging, and tends to occur at much smaller magnitudes. When you’re swaying back and forth with a fixed, non-OIS sensor, the entire frame is moving across differing capture pixels at a high rate of speed, versus a small subject doing a usually small in frame motion. They are a vastly different scale of problem. The days of shaky cam action are fast fading, and the blurry cam surrogates are the hanger-ons. The best option is a stabilized rig (but seriously). Next up is 5-axis optical image stabilization, and then its 3-axis cousin. Far behind is sensor-driven EIS. In last place are post-processing frame versus frame comparison options (they often falter in complex scenes, but will always be demoed with a far off horizon line in perfect conditions, with gentle, low frequency movements). Often on-camera OIS will be augmented with minimal EIS — usually during transition periods when OIS predicted the future wrong (to attempt to resolve the rapid catch-up), and also to deal with rolling shutter distortion. To address rolling shutter distortion, each line of the CMOS sensor is captured and read individually and sequentially, so during heavy movement, the frame can skew because the bottom of the scene was pulled from the sensor as much as 25ms after the beginning line of the scene (as you pan down things compress to be smaller, grow when panning up, and skew left and right during side movements). So during those rapid transition periods the camera may post process to do some gentle de-skewing, with a small amount of overflow capture resolution to provide the correction pixels. Rolling shutter distortion is another interesting effect because it’s a pretty significant problem with every CMOS device, but it didn’t become obvious until people started stabilizing frames. And to digress for a moment, the hero of an enormous amount of technology progress in the past ten years are the simple, unheralded MEMS gyroscopes. These are incredible devices, driven by a fascinating principle (vibrating structures reacting to the Coriolis effect), and they’re the foundation of enormous technology shifts. They’re a very recent innovation as well. Years ago it was stabilized tank turrets that had this technology (okay, some murdery technology is pretty cool), courtesy of giant, expensive mechanical gyroscopes. Now we have cheap little bike mount gimbals doing the same thing. For the curious, here’s the unzoomed original corrections as applied by Gallus. It was a fun, technically challenging project, despite the frustrations and sleepless nights. It began with some whiteboard considerations of optics and how they work, then field of view, sensor sizes, offset calculations, and so on. 1 – Developing Gallus presented unnecessary challenges. Android lacks reliable event timing, though that has improved somewhat in recent iterations. A lot of the necessary imaging metadata simply didn’t exist, because Google had no need for it (and this is a problem when sharecropping on a platform). As they got new interests, new functionality would appear that would expose a little more of the basic underlying hardware functionality (versus starting with a logical analysis of what such a system would consist of and designing a decent foundation). The whole camera subsystem is poorly designed and shockingly fragile. The number of Android handsets with terrible hardware is so high that building such an advanced, hardware-coupled application is an exercise in extreme frustration. And given some cynical feedback, note that this post is not a plea for people to use that app (this is not a subtle ad), though that should be obvious given that I start by telling you that the very foundation of EIS is flawed. I go through occasional spurts of updating the app (occasionally breaking it in the process), and having users bitching because an update notice inconvenienced their day kind of turned me off of the whole “want lots of users” thing, at least for an app as so “edge of the possible” as Gallus. 2 – While this post was ostensibly about the Pixel EIS claims, I was motivated to actually write it after seeing many of the comments on this video. That bike run, shot with a “Z1-ZRider2” actively stabilized gimbal (not a pitch for it — there are many that are largely identical) is beautifully smoothed, so it’s interesting to see all of the speculation about it being smoothed in post (e.g. via some frame-v-frame solution). Not a chance. If it was shot unstabilized or with EIS (which is, for the purpose of discussion, unstabilized) it would have been a disastrous mess of blurred foliage and massive cropping, for the reasons discussed, even under the moderate sun. Already objects moving closer to the lens (and in a frame relative sense faster) are heavily blurred, but the entirety of the scene would have that blur or worse minus mechanical stabilization. There is an exaggerated sense of faith in what is possible with post-process smoothing. Garbage in = garbage out. 3 – One of my next technical challenge projects relates to this.

He told CNBC that with Alphabet's focus on competing in the machine learning and artificial intelligence spaces, Google usage will spike once those functions are developed. "I think that there's reason for optimism beyond just the near term on Google," Munster said on "Squawk Box." Alphabet reported third-quarter earnings that topped estimates, thanks to strong results in its search, YouTube and Google Cloud segments. Earnings per share for Google's parent company came in at $9.06, adjusted, on revenue of $22.45 billion.

James Cakmak, equity analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., said Friday that Google needs "two major cultural shifts." "If they go into hardware, they need to be able to spend tons of money and have a high-tolerance threshold for marketing spend and building out that distribution network for the Pixel," Cakmak told "Squawk Box" in a separate interview.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News Best Google Pixel cases Best Google Pixel cases By James Rogerson Mobile phones   Keep your Pixel perfect Shares The Google Pixel is a great phone – so good in fact that we gave it four and a half stars in our review. As a Google handset it’s also got a big name behind it, and like any big-name smartphone there’s a wide range of cases available for the Pixel. These range from the sleek and minimalist, to the strong and bulky, to multi-purpose cases, arty covers and more, so there’s sure to be one that fits your needs and tastes. We’ve collected ten of the best below, any of which would be a great addition to your new Pixel, as the last thing you want is a scratched or broken phone. Note: we've ranked these from cheapest to most expensive according to prices at time of writing. 1. Spigen Liquid Crystal Case A cheap, slimline option Colors: Crystal Clear | Material: TPU Shows off your phone Cheap Minimal protection Made of plastic The Spigen Liquid Crystal case has a lot going for it, starting with the fact that it’s very cheap, which is handy for anyone who’s already stretched their budget buying the Pixel. But despite its low price the Liquid Crystal is well-designed, with a slim and light form-fitting build, that maintains the shape of your handset, and being transparent it also maintains the Pixel’s looks, so if you’re a fan of the phone’s unusual metal and glass design you won’t have to hide it away. It’s not the most protective case around, but it’s easy to put on, resists smudges and should keep your Pixel safe from minor scrapes and falls. 2. Spigen Rugged Armor Case Serious protection at minimal cost Colors: Black | Material: TPU Durable Carbon fiber accents Only comes in black Chunky Another Spigen case, but this one has a little bit more going on. You lose the slim transparent design of the Liquid Crystal case, but in its place you get a case which has passed military grade drop tests (which apparently means being dropped 26 times from a height of 48 inches and surviving). The Spigen Rugged Armor achieves this thanks to a spider web pattern and air cushioned corners on the inside of a TPU shell. The case isn’t much to look at, but textured carbon fiber accents mean it’s more than just a nondescript black block. Credit: Olixar / Mobile Fun 3. Olixar Leather-Style Google Pixel Wallet A leather look at a low price Colors: Black, Brown | Material: Faux-leather Card slots and stand Stylish Not real leather Middling protection If you want to give your Pixel a classy coat you could do worse than this Olixar case, which, while not real leather, still looks the part and comes in a lot cheaper than you’d typically pay for a genuine leather case. Its wallet-like design goes beyond the looks too, with two card slots, and you can also use it as a stand to enjoy videos on. Plus, while the cover is shut your screen is fully covered, providing an element of protection which most other cases can’t match. Credit: VRS Design / Amazon 4. VRS Design High Pro Shield A protective case for mobile media fans Colors: Dark Silver, Really Blue, Satin Silver | Material: Polycarbonate and TPU Lots of protection Kickstand Not slim Made of plastic The VRS Design High Pro Shield isn’t the slimmest case around, but it’s thinner than you might expect given the level of protection it provides. The case is certified as offering military grade protection, so you can feel confident that your Pixel is safe, and while made of plastic the High Pro Shield sports a brushed metal effect that helps it stand out from the crowd. Speaking of metal, there’s also a metal kickstand built in, so you can prop your phone up when watching movies. Credit: Tetded / Amazon 5. Tetded Cowhide Leather Case Real leather with a slim design Colors: Black | Material: Leather Genuine leather Slim No card slots Only comes in black If only real leather will do, then check out the Tetded Cowhide Leather case. It’s one of very few genuine leather Pixel cases at time of writing, and predictably you do pay a premium for it. But the case undeniably looks good, with a slim profile that avoids adding too much bulk, and a microfiber lining to keep your screen protected when the case is closed. 6. Pixel Phone Case by Google A colorful case that fits like a glove Colors: Gray, Blue, Green, Peach, Coral | Material: Silicone, polycarbonate and microfiber Lots of color choices Good fit Looks cheap Fairly pricey If you want a case that’s guaranteed to be a good fit, then look no further than the Pixel Phone Case. This is created by the same team as the Pixel itself, so it fits like a glove. It also comes in a range of colors to suit almost any style and provides three layers of protection, with a silicone exterior for shock absorption and grip, a polycarbonate core for support and a soft microfiber interior. 7. Incipio Carnaby Case An unusual case that's comfortable to hold Colors: Black, Gray, Olive | Material: TPU, polymer and cotton Interesting design Soft feel Expensive Mostly plastic Making a case stand out, without making it look weird, can be a tricky job, but we’d say the Incipio Carnaby succeeds, as on top of the fairly standard plastic shell there’s a layer of cotton, which looks different (in a good way) and makes the case soft to the touch. Available in three distinct shades, the Carnaby is also strong and shock absorbent, so as well as looking good it does the vital job of keeping your Pixel safe. 8. OtterBox Commuter A strong case that protects from damage and dust Colors: Black, Pink | Material: Polycarbonate and rubber Drop protection Keeps dirt and dust out Bulky Pricey OtterBox is a big name in cases and for good reason, with its Commuter case providing serious levels of protection. An inner rubber cover and outer polycarbonate shell provide two layers of protection, deflecting shocks away from your phone, while port covers keep dirt and dust out. All of which sounds great on paper, but OtterBox has extensively trialled the case, over more than 238 hours and 24 tests, so you can be sure it lives up to the billing. 9. Artworks Live Case Turns your phone into a work of art Colors: Various | Material: Polycarbonate Customizable Unusual Middling protection Quite expensive Most cases are quite plain, but the Artworks Live Case isn’t most cases. As an official Google case you can be confident that it’s well-built, but the real selling point is the ability to apply an artwork to it, for a truly eye-catching cover. There’s a fairly wide range of images available to choose from, and you can position your artwork of choice however you want on the case, for a unique, custom finish. 10. Photos Live Case A case with unlimited options Colors: Various | Material: Polycarbonate Can make it your own Slim fit Not the most protective case Could look tacky If you want even more creative freedom than Google’s Artwork cases offer, then check out the Photos Live Case. This is a similar idea, except you can upload one of your own photos as an image for the case, meaning the possibilities are endless and your Pixel can truly reflect you. Or if you’re lacking inspiration you could look at the Places Live Case, which lets you select a location from Google Maps, then pick from a range of styles and colors to print it in.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News Here’s why the Google Pixel XL isn’t as cheap as a Nexus Here’s why the Google Pixel XL isn’t as cheap as a Nexus By James Peckham Mobile phones   Pricey Google Pixel devices Shares There's now a clear reason why the Google Pixel line costs more than older, cheaper Nexus devices did when each launched. Finance service company IHS Markit has revealed the Pixel XL materials cost $278 (about £230, AU$370) for each device.  It also costs $7.75 (about £6, AU$10) to manufacture each device as well. The Google Pixel XL features a 5.5-inch screen, 32GB of storage and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor – high-end specs that match other flagship phones in 2016. Not Nexus prices It currently costs $769 (£719, AU$1,269) to buy a Pixel XL upfront, which gives it a similar cost-to-sales-price ratio in line with the iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S7. The Galaxy S7 has a slightly smaller manufacturing cost of $255 (about £210, AU$340), which includes the materials and manufacturing costs. The Galaxy S7 is now cheaper to buy than the Pixel XL at $750 (about £569, AU$900) though. Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit, said “Total BOM costs for the Google Pixel XL are, not surprisingly, in line with those of other competitors, because the supply base and specs are very similar from phone to phone—whether it’s an iPhone, a Galaxy-series phone or the Google Pixel XL." You may be disappointed the Pixel XL costs more than previous Nexus phones, but if Google can make a profit from these devices the company is sure to keep on making great, high-end phones for you to buy in years to come.

GOOGL stock keeps steadily climbing after the search giant blows out top- and bottom-line expectations By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 28, 2016, 8:16 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Enters ‘Survivor Mode’ Recent Posts: Fight Deflation With United States Steel Corporation (X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty ESPN Strangles Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock AGAIN View All Posts The investment lesson of this decade is that cloud rules. Once you have an addictive application running inside cloud data centers, the software scales automatically and the sky is the limit on profits. Source: Google/Samsung Google — from the artist now known as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) — was the initial addictive cloud application. While Google didn’t invent the cloud concept, it was the first company to take full advantage of it, virtualizing its software in scaled data centers, and using distributed computing to create vast streams of data that have made it the world’s dominant computing company. The question as Alphabet announced third-quarter earnings on October 27, then, was how high could the cloud go? The consensus number on earnings for the third quarter was $8.63 per share of GOOGL stock on revenues of $22.05 billion. The hoped-for “whisper number” was for $8.72 per share in earnings. This compared with earnings of $8.59 per share and revenues of $20.6 billion in the second quarter. In other words, more cloud efficiency, more money on the bottom line — even if revenue soured a little. In the five days before earnings, Google shares mirrored the behavior of the Nasdaq, as they frequently do, rising 2% on Monday, giving that back over the succeeding three days, but still sitting near their all-time high. While most analysts had buy ratings on GOOGL stock, Wedbush’s James Dix was calling it a “sell.” So, how did he do? The Number and Its Meaning It was a beat. Make that a beatdown. Alphabet net income came in at $6.326 billion, or $9.06 per share, on revenues of $22.451 billion. Earnings were up 34% from a year ago, and revenues were up 20%. Cost per click fell as YouTube cut traffic acquisition costs on mobile. The initial reaction was to take shares up 2.1%, to $830, after they closed at around $817. Most of what investors saw was simply full speed ahead. Traffic acquisition costs were 21% of revenue, just as they had been in the second quarter, and the same as a year ago. The revenue rise of 20% was in line with the second quarter’s 21%. The big surprise was paid clicks, up 33%, against 29% in the second quarter, meaning mobile and YouTube are now contributing strongly to earnings. Alphabet’s core business had operating earnings of $6.8 billion, up from $5.8 billion during the same period a year ago. The board also announced another $7 billion in share buybacks. Reports that Google Fiber would cut back on its expansion plans, lay off people in many cities and look toward lower-cost ways of expanding access, instead of digging up my street (as they’re doing now), had created bearish sentiment. Craig Barratt, who had led the Google Fiber effort, announced he is stepping down, and the company seemed anxious to see if Webpass, acquired earlier this year, could deliver wireless technology that would reduce costs. But reining in such “other bets” should have investors cheering.

By Sarmistha Acharya October 28, 2016 13:31 BST Google releases new update for its Allo messaging app Google Google has begun rolling out a new update to its Allo smart messaging app, which is available through a new version 2.0. The announcement comes from Google's official Nexus Twitter account, although the product page in the Play Store is yet to reflect the changes. This is the first major update after Google made the Allo app available for users on both Android and iOS platforms. It was launched at the company's I/O annual event, alongside the Duo video calling app. So what's the significance of this update? The update adds support for multitasking and offers users the ability to reply directly from notifications. A major annoyance for users since the official release was the lack of ability to replay from the message notifications. The update to Allo now adds a reply button for replying directly from the notifications. This is similar to quick replies on Hangouts and Google Messenger. According to the screenshots shared by AndroidPolice, the sender's name and image are now visible in the notifications. Another notable feature is support for Android Wear. Very much like Hangouts and Google Messenger, the latest update allows users to reply with their voice and emoji on Android Wear. All you need to do is tap on the notification and start speaking or tap Draw emoji. Alternatively, you can reply with the automated responses. In addition to that, Allo now allows users to send GIF via keyboard. Following is the detailed changelog for the release. Direct replies in notifications Direct share App shortcuts for Android 7.1+ GIFs in keyboard for Android 7.1+ Monochrome chat in settings Multitasking Splash screen Incognito key alerts Landscape The update is already rolling out in the Play Store. In case you can't get it, consider using the APK mirror. Google Allo now supports multitasking in #AndroidNougat.

Close share panel × Image copyright EPA Image caption Search algorithms can bias what people see online, said Ms Merkel Angela Markel has said that the way search engines and social networks like Google and Facebook choose what people see online should be made public. The German chancellor said the secrecy around the algorithms used by online platforms threatened open debate. Without greater scrutiny, many people could get a distorted or censored view of events, she said. Google and Facebook told German paper Der Spiegel they gave the public a lot of information about how they worked. Mrs Merkel's call for action follows work by German politicians to investigate how the software works. 'Informed citizens' "This is a development that we need to pay careful attention to," Ms Merkel said in a keynote speech to the Medientage conference in Munich earlier this week. "The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle, which diverse media must pass through to reach users," she added. "These algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception, they narrow our breadth of information," she warned. Mrs Merkel called on the algorithms to be made public so "informed citizens" can see the influences on what they are fed via social media, news feeds and search results. In many cases, said the German chancellor, information was drawn from a limited list of sources. Scientist Cathy O'Neil, who has written extensively about the inner workings of data algorithms and their potential for harm, said most of the information Facebook shared was technical and rarely touched on how influential it was. "What we have right now is an incredibly influential platform that has no reason to measure its influence because it will likely open it up to regulation," she said. In late 2016, a cross-party group of German politicians will send the results of an investigation into algorithms used by Facebook, Google and other internet firms to the EU's digital commissioner Gunther Oettinger. "The chancellor has touched on an important issue," Mr Oettinger told Der Spiegel [link in German].

Google Assistant Channel Available on IFTTT for Android GO Voice command actions are now available in IFTTT Oct 28, 2016 11:48 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has taken on Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana and launched its own smart service called Google Assistant. The service was first introduced during Google I/O in May and it revealed improvements to the experience in Google Now using OK Google voice controls. Google Assistant arrived with Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones and it seems that it can also be enabled on Nexus smartphones that run Android Nougat. The service is quite useful with Google’s own application Allo and it will be a central part of Google Home too. Google Assistant channel is now available on IFTTT with various voice commands. IFTTT (If This, Then That) is a service that allows users to create chains of simple statements, which can be triggered based on changes to other services like Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest. IFTTT offers a list of examples of recipes using Google Assistant The connections are called recipes and users can create their own with the IFTTT service. The IFTTT app is available on Android and iOS, as well as in the form of a web service. IFTTT states that Google Assistant works with the app only if it’s installed on a Pixel smartphone or Google Home. Other smartphones that have regular OK Google commands won’t work. Users can choose the trigger phrase, action from IFTTT channels and even the replies that Assistant would send. Google even provided some recipes for IFTTT users to check out, including the option to send Slack voice notes, block off time in the calendar or find the phone by voice. There are numerous other recipes that users can create using Google Assistant channel on IFTTT, based on their needs. Virtual assistants have become increasingly popular lately, and even Samsung is said to be working on its own smart service after the company acquired Viv Labs, founded by the creators of Siri. #Google#IFTTT#Google Assistant#Pixel#Pixel XL subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Samsung Galaxy S8 to Feature Slick Design, Better Camera and Enhanced AI Service Google Updates Allo with Split-Screen Support and Direct Reply Samsung Reportedly Started Developing Firmware for the Galaxy S8 Google Assistant Can Be Enabled on Rooted Android Nougat Devices OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2 Mozilla Firefox 50.0 Now Available for Download, Brings Built-in Emoji on Linux    Google Assistant is now a channel in IFTTT New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments LG G5 Starts Receiving Android 7.0 Nougat Update more on: LG G5 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The San Francisco social media company released its third-quarter earnings yesterday.  In a letter to shareholders (PDF), Twitter said it will cut 9 percent of its global workforce — about 350 positions. Twitter ended the quarter with 3,910 employees. The cuts are supposed to improve efficiency and improve profitability.  "The restructuring allows us to continue to fully fund our highest priorities, while eliminating investment in non-core areas and driving greater efficiency. Over time, we will look to invest in additional areas, as justified by expected returns and business results," company officials wrote. Total revenue reached $616 million for the third quarter, up 8 percent year-over-year (YoY) and above Twitter's previously forecasted range of $590 million to $610 million. Total advertising revenue of $545 million grew 6 percent YoY. Total monthly active users grew to 317 million. The Vine departure will be sad for the fans of those six-second, repeating videos. Rus Yusupov founded the company with Dom Hofmann and Colin Kroll in June 2012. It was sold to Twitter for a reported $30 million a few months later. It's a sale now Yusupov apparently regrets, evidenced by a viral Tweet today: Don’t sell your company! — Rus (@rus) October 27, 2016 In an announcement about its discontinuation, the Vine team said millions of people have turned to Vine "to laugh at loops and see creativity unfold." I'm a new soul https://t.co/MLmLuKIwPc — SixSecondCovers (@SixSecondCovers) October 24, 2016 "We’ll be keeping the website online because we think it’s important to still be able to watch all the incredible Vines that have been made," officials said. "You will be notified before we make any changes to the app or website. And speaking of Twitter, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff this week confired he’s no longer looking to buy the micro-blogging platform. As we earlier surmised, Benioff was feeling pressure from investors. He  explained, “We’ve never had a deal leak before. We don’t really understand that dynamic. We had to stop (considering buying Twitter) because I’m running the business in partnership with my shareholders.” Benioff made the comments at WSJDLive in Laguna Beach, Calif. this week, an invitation-only conference where CEOs, founders, pioneers and investors explore a wide range of tech-related issues. In other technology news... Oracle Appeals Google Copyright Case Oracle is appealing a May ruling in favor of Google in a copyright and patent lawsuit case. Oracle, as expected, filed this week in federal appeals court (PDF). The two companies have been entangled in the lawsuit over JavaScript and API issues since 2010. Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems and acquired the rights to Java in 2010. Oracle claimed Google infringed copyrights and patents by using the Java-based API technology in building out its Android operating system. Oracle lost the case, but kept parts of it alive on appeal. Its latest defeat came in May, when a jury ruled Google's use of the APIs was on fair use. This week's appeal gives the suit new life. Dataiku Raises $14M Dataiku, a predictive analytics software vendor, closed a $14 million Series A round of funding led by FirstMark Capital. Dataiku expects to accelerate its commercial efforts in the United States, Europe and Asia. According to company officials, Dataiku saw 300 percent growth in 2016, doubling its teams in Europe and in the United States. It also landed customers including NPR, L’Oreal, Hostelworld, Bechtel and other Fortune 1000 companies. “As the big data market reaches early maturity, the time has come for a platform that makes everything and everyone work together, whether it is Hadoop, machine learning, data scientists or data analysts, and that is exactly what Dataiku offers”, Matt Turck, managing director at FirstMark Capital, said in a statement. In August, the company released its latest software update: it became Spark Native by supporting programming language Scala (in addition to Python, R, Pig, Hive, SQL and more), Dataiku 3.1 also announced the full integration of five visual machine learning backends (H2O Sparkling Water, Spark MLlib, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost and Vertica ML). Evergage Supports Mobile Somerville, Mass.-based personalization provider Evergage updated Evergage for Mobile Apps to include support for Android operating systems and native in-app messaging capabilities. Evergage for Mobile Apps tracks the behaviors and actions of mobile app users as well as data from the website, web applications and other channels, including third-party systems such as CRM and email marketing solutions. “By tracking and examining a user’s demographic details, history and in-app behaviors in real time — we’re talking milliseconds — Evergage for Mobile Apps helps marketers engage visitors in the moment, as their interest is piqued, with the most relevant and personalized experiences,” Karl Wirth, co-founder and CEO of Evergage, said in a statement. “By extending support to Android operating systems, marketers can bring real one-to-one personalization to more mobile apps, making multichannel personalization a greater reality.” Andrew Moore Joins Splice Board Andrew Moore Andrew Moore, the dean of the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, is joining the board of Splice Machine, which provides open-source SQL RDBMS powered by Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. Before CMU, Moore was vice president of engineering at Google, where he headed the retail segment, Google Shopping. “In my years at Google I often wondered how great it would be if other fields of endeavor would have equal access to big data infrastructure as we had to support advertising,” Moore said. “What excites me about Splice Machine is that it enables artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data management at price points that make it accessible to governments, education and companies of all sizes and industries. And its support for standard interfaces, programming languages and SQL make it accessible to a much larger audience, so companies do not have to hire expensive specialists to gain the benefits.” DMA Rebrands Goodbye, Direct Marketing Association.

Before you settle down for your regular TV programming, check your local listings to see what shows are on that offer a bit of a Halloween twist. From baking shows to sitcoms, everyone is getting ready to offer a little bit of a scare and there are some fun programs leading up to Halloween on Monday. ‘Bates Motel’ fans trick Google Maps; offers fake hotel guest reviews on TV show studio “Bates Motel” is getting some seriously crappy reviews. No, I’m not talking about the show, I’m talking about the location where the show is filmed and it’s being done on purpose. The show has painstakingly made a set perfect for this series. In fact, it’s so perfect that it can be seen by Google satellites which is describing the area as a real hotel on Google maps. Fans started noticing this odd fact and started sharing reviews of the hotel. Unfortunately for Google, the viewers started leaving comments about the hotel (yes, the fake one) and it’s steadily grown to be a “Bates Motel” fan tradition.

Cast in talks to bring show back For fans of “Will & Grace” the showed ended years ago and tears were shed over the parting of ways. Now the rumors of the return of the sitcom has fans every excited. As the fans have been warned this is show in the preliminary stages, it’s looking to be the real deal and could be aired in the not-too-distant future. Here’s to hoping this really happens! It would lovely to see these characters on TV again. ‘The Americans’ transform a college building lobby into a foreign airport Television set designers are the most underappreciated crew on a filming set. They make an area look like it needs to look and spare no expense in doing so. Perhaps that’s why the lobby of the science building at Queens college is so amazing. Students who use the building for classes have taken to social media to report the lobby was made into a foreign airport for “The Americans”. From what it looks like, it’s quite an amazing feat that brings another country to America. Plus, there is another similarity: Everyone at this fake foreign airport is standing in line too. And Finally…Boo! Is that a McDonalds or Burger King? Have you ever stopped at McDonalds or Burger King on your way home picking up food for a chance to kick off your shoes and watch television without having to worry about making dinner (or moving from the sofa)? I’ve done it at least twice this month. However, I have always known which drive thru I was pulling into. That’s why this Halloween prank is so funny. Take a look at the video clip and see how Burger King would look if it dressed up as McDonalds. Yeah, it’s hilarious and as long as the fries are crispy, I’d stop at either location!

Resend activation e-mail Ministry of Innovation / Business of Technology Op-ed: Salvaging Google Fiber’s achievements Google Fiber hasn't changed the world—yet. by Benoît Felten - Oct 28, 2016 11:30 am UTC Login to bookmark 50 Boxes of equipment needed to install Google Fiber broadband network sit on a couch at the home of customer Becki Sherwood in Kansas City, Kansas. Julie Denesha/Bloomberg via Getty Images Benoît Felten is a broadband expert and the chief research officer at Diffraction Analysis. His views do not necessarily represent those of Ars Technica. In the wake of Google Access CEO Craig Barratt’s “goodbye Access” post on the Google Fiber blog yesterday, papers left, right, and center are predicting the end of Google Fiber. Barratt tries to sound upbeat, but in essence he’s announcing that Google Fiber won’t be expanding further (pending a strategic reevaluation), that people will be made redundant, and that he’s leaving. I don’t know Craig and can’t really comment on his tenure as Access CEO, but that doesn’t exactly sound like good news. For analysts like myself, Google Fiber is a complicated project to track; any infrastructure venture on the scale of Google Fiber as currently announced would have had to disclose numbers by now. Wall Street would have asked for take rates and average revenue per user (ARPU) and all kinds of other metrics to evaluate the validity of the investment. Before the Alphabet restructuring, however, this was just another Google "pie in the sky" project. Now that Access is its own company, we might have expected these numbers to finally come out. So far, though, Google isn’t talking. So we’re left to speculate. I’ve been thinking about this not just for the last few weeks but for a couple of years at least, and I finally want to share these thoughts now that Google Fiber seems to be at a turning point. Just to be clear: this is not me sharing information, this is me analyzing and speculating on the basis of what little we know and trying to think how what’s been achieved might be salvaged and expanded upon. Laying the groundwork Without going too far back, my impression has always been that Google Fiber was a schizophrenic project. At the very beginning, it felt like those Google decision makers who were more interested in achieving important policy goals wanted Google Fiber to be a catalyst, something that would shift the market with a bang and then be a shared experience for others (public or private) to take over. The idea of a "blueprint" was floated in the early days. But there were also those who seemed to think that Google Fiber could become a new business for the company, something not just aimed at shifting market perceptions and shaking the complacency of telco and cable incumbents but a profitable business line in its own right. That has always seemed to me to be an unlikely proposition. I am confronted on a daily basis with the paradox of short-term focused telecom operators considering long-term fiber investment efforts, but their short-term is longer than Google’s core business short-term by an order of magnitude. Unless there was a long game plan to view this as the “pension fund” arm of Google’s finances, it didn’t really make sense to me. And if I’m honest, I didn’t much care about that second proposition anyway. The US market is already plagued by a lack of competition in fixed. Replacing one closed monopoly by another (no matter how much sexier) didn’t seem to me like a particularly desirable goal. So while I fully wanted to believe in the potential for Google Fiber kicking the telecom anthill, I wasn’t so convinced by the relevance and likelihood of this becoming a fiber business like every other. Now that it looks like there’s at least some serious soul-searching around the second proposition, I think it’s time to consider whether the first has worked and how things could go from there. Infrastructure is expensive My take is that there was one fundamental flaw going into this, one that’s probably still floating around: Google believed it could revolutionize the laying of fiber. It didn’t just think it could offer a kickass service; it thought it could deploy much cheaper and much faster than anybody else had ever done. That’s fully in line with the Google mindset, but unfortunately it ignores the fact that hundreds of companies had been deploying wireline access infrastructure for years by the time Google Fiber decided to give it a go. I’d suggest we’re now seeing the fallout from that misguided assumption: Google is finally admitting (in a roundabout way) that despite all the clever people it has on hand, the company hasn't revolutionized fiber deployment. It still takes time to do the planning properly, to work with local authorities effectively, to do the outside plant layout efficiently. Did Google manage to do things cheaper than others did? Probably, but not by a wide margin. And as it decided to scale beyond Kansas City, it realized that the efficiencies it might have been able to find in KC didn’t scale well elsewhere because a lot of those things are down to local specificities and relationships. So Google is deploying fiber in the access, it's doing it well, but it's not doing it so well that this is hugely more profitable for them than it would be for anyone else. In other words, the cost side of the equation is roughly on par with industry norms (again, my speculation). What about the revenue side? Revenue perspective On the revenue side, the two key metrics are take-up and ARPU—and the first one is much more important than the second. Google understood that and went with a frankly very cool product at a very affordable price point. I’ve never been really convinced by the need to have a linear TV play, but that’s beside the point; if Google wanted a chance at a high take-up, it needed a low price point and a kickass product. That’s not always enough, though; incumbents respond by lowering their price locally, migration is a painful process for the customer, etc. There are many reasons for inertia in customer acquisition even with a good product, a fantastic brand, and a collaborative local community. My bet is that Google’s take-up is not that great in the markets it has started commercializing. Note that it may be very good by industry norms, but again, remember that Google expected to blow industry norms away from the get-go. If I had to guess a number, I’d say Google Fiber is in the 30-40 percent take-up range in areas that have been open for service for three years. Industry average is about 7 percent per year the last time we looked into it, so that’s very good, but again probably not enough by Google standards. Pre-sales in Kansas City were astounding. When that data was still publicly available we scraped the website and analyzed it. Some areas had over 100 percent pre-subscription, and, if I recall, the average pre-subscription rate was already in that 30-40 percent bracket even before it had started deploying. The problem is that these people want you to connect them now when in fact it’s going to take months, if not years, to get to them. By the time you actually get there, they may have moved out, they may have finally had a good offer from their cable operator, or they may just be pissed off at you taking so long to serve them. So that (in my opinion) is what’s happening at Google Access right now: costs are higher than planned (even though lower than industry norms would suggest) and take-up is lower than expected (even though higher than industry norms would suggest). Since Google isn’t really looking at this as an infrastructure player would, it’s time to reconsider. The air up there In parallel to that, wireless is starting to look like a potential solution to some of the problems. Don’t believe the hype about residential fixed service being substituted by a wireless access solution any time soon, at least not in most urban geographies. There are promising technologies ahead, but they’re far from mature yet. Google’s acquisition of Webpass, however, is interesting. Few journalists took the time to try to understand what Webpass does. Webpass uses wireless solutions for urban aggregation, not access. In other words, it doesn’t connect homes wirelessly, it connects multi-tenant units wirelessly and uses existing in-building wiring to connect the homes from the rooftop antenna. It’s a clever approach that solves two fundamental deployment issues: – it eliminates the need to pull fiber along street poles or bury ducts in the pavement to pull fiber along the streets. This is both costly and time-consuming; – it eliminates the need to deploy fiber inside the home, also expensive and time-consuming, by reusing the existing wiring. However, that approach does not seem to me to be so universal as to be usable in any deployment scenario. There are a number of potential issues that I see with it: First, you need to target multi-tenant buildings to make the economics work. I suspect (again, not knowing the exact costs of the solution) that the equipment necessary to install this on single homes would make the price point too high. Furthermore, you need line of sight between rooftops, which is comparatively easy when people live in high downtown MDUs, not so easy when they live in detached homes. Second, you need to be able to reuse the existing cabling in the house. I haven’t had time to look into the specific regulatory aspects of this (and particularly to see if this varies from state to state or county to county in the US), but my bet is you can’t always bank on being able to reuse the cabling, especially if it has been deployed by an incumbent or a cable operator. I may be wrong here, and I will be doing my homework on this, but I’m flagging it as a risk. Expand full story Page: 1 2 Next → Reader comments 50 You must login or create an account to comment.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo San Francisco - Facebook’s software knows your face almost as well as your mother does. And like mom, it isn’t asking your permission to do what it wants with old photos. While millions of internet users embrace the tagging of family and friends in photos, others worried there’s something devious afoot are trying block Facebook as well as Google from amassing such data. As advances in facial recognition technology give companies the potential to profit from biometric data, privacy advocates see a pattern in how the world’s largest social network and search engine have sold users’ viewing histories for advertising. The companies insist that gathering data on what you look like isn’t against the law, even without your permission. If judges agree with Facebook and Google, they may be able to kill off lawsuits filed under a unique Illinois law that carries fines of $1 000 to $5 000 each time a person’s image is used without permission - big enough for a liability headache if claims on behalf of millions of consumers proceed as class actions. A loss by the companies could lead to new restrictions on using biometrics in the U.S., similar to those in Europe and Canada. Facebook declined to comment on its court fight. Google declined to comment on pending litigation. Courts have struggled over what qualifies as an injury to pursue a privacy case in lawsuits accusing Facebook and Google of siphoning users’ personal information from e-mails and monitoring their web browsing habits. Suits over selling the data to advertisers have often failed. This year, the US Supreme Court set a “concrete injury” standard for privacy suits, a ruling that both sides are using to argue their case ahead of a hearing Thursday in San Francisco over Facebook’s bid to dismiss the biometrics case. Google is fending off suits in Chicago, arguing that the Illinois statute can’t apply outside the state under the Constitution’s interstate commerce rules. Google also contends the Illinois law doesn’t regulate photos. Facebook encourages users to "tag" people in photographs they upload in their personal posts and the social network stores the collected information. The company uses a program it calls DeepFace to match other photos of a person. Alphabet Inc.’s cloud-based Google Photos service uses similar technology. The billions of images Facebook is thought to be collecting could be even more valuable to identity thieves than the names, addresses, and credit card numbers now targeted by hackers, according to privacy advocates and legal experts. While those types of information are mutable - even Social Security numbers can be changed - biometric data for retinas, fingerprints, hands, face geometry and blood samples, are unique identifiers. “Biometric identifiers are a key way to link together information about people,” such as discrete financial, medical and educational records, said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who isn’t involved in the case. Facebook has “cleverly got its users to improve the accuracy of its own database,” he said. And just how good is Facebook’s technology? According to the company’s research, DeepFace recognises faces with an accuracy rate of 97.35 percent compared with 97.5 percent for humans - including mothers. Rotenberg said the privacy concerns are twofold: Facebook might sell the information to retailers or be forced to turn it over to law enforcement - in both cases without users knowing it. While most of the earlier privacy lawsuits relied on federal wiretap laws, the facial recognition cases hinge on the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The Illinois residents who sued under the 2008 law say it gives them a “property interest” in the algorithms that constitute their digital identities -- in other words, that gives them grounds to accuse Facebook of real harm. Facebook got the case moved to San Francisco. “Just as trade secrets or subscriber lists can be proprietary to a company like Facebook, unique and unchangeable biometric identifiers are proprietary to individuals,” according to their complaint. They also claim an “informational injury” because Facebook didn’t get consent to collect their so-called faceprints. Facebook says the lawsuit should be thrown out because the users haven’t suffered a concrete injury such as physical harm, loss of money or property; or even a denial of their right to free speech or religion. The plaintiffs "have offered no specific or coherent allegations explaining how this collection and storage actually affects their privacy - much less causes them concrete harm," Facebook argued in a court filing. Facebook offered examples that might work, such as if users were identified in an embarrassing photo that cost them their jobs, were victims of identity theft, or were caught in a compromising situation that harmed their relationships. While one person might be able to bring such a case, a group lawsuit would be impossible because it would “create a sea of individualised issues,” Facebook says. Legal experts say it’s unclear which side will benefit from the Supreme Court’s “concrete harm” ruling in a case involving search engine operator Spokeo. "Spokeo is vague about what kinds of injury are concrete enough to count," said Julie Cohen, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. "Everybody is scrambling for advantage." Facebook v.

SAN FRANCISCO — YouTube has emerged as a break-out star in Google’s cast of services as the online video site upstages cable television for a younger generation of viewers looking for amusement, news and music on their smartphones. The trend has shifted a bigger chunk of advertising budgets from traditional network television programming to the more eclectic and diversified mix of clips ranging from cute cat videos to sobering shots of street violence found on YouTube. As more advertising dollars flow to YouTube, it’s making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report released Thursday, Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 per cent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 per cent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. All that money is providing Google with more financial firepower to buy the rights to stream cable networks’ shows on YouTube, too, something likely to reel in even more viewers. It also is helping to finance Alphabet’s investments in far-flung projects ranging from self-driving cars to internet-beaming balloons. That segment, known as “Other Bets,” lost $865 million during the July-September period, narrowing from a $980 million setback last year as Alphabet imposed more expense controls. YouTube already has proven to be one of the best bets that Google has ever made since it bought the video site for $1.76 billion a decade ago. At that juncture, YouTube consisted mostly of crudely made videos shot by amateurs and clips pirated from movie and TV studios that were threatening to sue the site into oblivion. It had built a worldwide audience of about 72 million viewers when Google took control in November 2006. Since then, YouTube has evolved into a far more polished channel that has spawned unlikely stars such as “PewDiePie” (Swedish comedian Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg) while largely making peace with studios by creating an automated screening system that detects pirated content. YouTube says it has paid more than $2 billion to studios that have chosen to leave their material on the site and share in the ad revenue generated by their clips. Meanwhile, YouTube’s audience has surpassed one billion, with 80 per cent of the viewers outside the U.S. YouTube also boasts that its site reaches more people between the ages of 18 and 34 years old — the “millennial” generation — than any cable network. That segment of YouTube’s audience is a major reason why more than half its video clips are watched on mobile devices. Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., doesn’t disclose how much money YouTube is making, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates YouTube’s annual revenue has now reached $10 billion and is increasing by as much as 40 per cent a year. The growth makes YouTube “one of the strongest assets fundamentally on the internet today,” Mahaney wrote in a research note earlier this week. Despite its progress, YouTube has been slow in realizing its full potential, leaving it vulnerable to new challengers for viewer’s attention, such as Facebook’s Live video feature, says Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson. The problem, as Olson sees it, is that YouTube has had trouble persuading TV and movie studios to license more of their content on their site, something that that might have made YouTube as dominant in video as Google is in search. But YouTube could be on a major breakthrough, according to a report published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal. Citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Google had reached an agreement with CBS to include its network in a cable-like service called “Unplugged” that will debut on YouTube next year. Google is also negotiating for the rights to the Fox network, ESPN and NBC, among others, the Journal said. “The dam appears to be finally cracking” for even better content to come to YouTube, Olson said. © Copyright Times Colonist Related Tonight's TV schedule Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 10.28.16. 10.28.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am How AI Is Shaking Up the Chip Market Clayton Cotterell for WIRED In less than 12 hours, three different people offered to pay me if I’d spend an hour talking to a stranger on the phone. All three said they’d enjoyed reading an article I’d written about Google building a new computer chip for artificial intelligence, and all three urged me to discuss the story with one of their clients. Each described this client as the manager of a major hedge fund, but wouldn’t say who it was. The requests came from what are called expert networks—research firms that connect investors with people who can help them understand particular markets and provide a competitive edge (sometimes, it seems, through insider information). These expert networks wanted me to explain how Google’s AI processor would affect the chip market. But first, they wanted me to sign a non-disclosure agreement. I declined. These unsolicited, extremely specific, high-pressure requests—which arrived about three week ago—underscore the radical changes underway in the enormously lucrative computer chip market, changes driven by the rise of artificial intelligence. Those hedge fund managers see these changes coming, but aren’t quite sure how they’ll play out. Of course, no one is quite sure how they’ll play out. Today, Internet giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and China’s Baidu are exploring a wide range of chip technologies that can drive AI forward, and the choices they make will shift the fortunes of chipmakers like Intel and nVidia. But at this point, even the computer scientists within those online giants don’t know what the future holds. Going Deep These companies run their online services from data centers packed with thousands of servers, each driven by a chip called a central processing unit, or CPU. But as they embrace a form of AI called deep neural networks, these companies are supplementing CPUs with other processors. Neural networks can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, including everything from identifing faces and objects in photos to translating between languages, and they require more than just CPU power. And so Google built the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU. Microsoft is using a processor called a field programmable gate array, or FPGA. Myriad companies employ machines equipped with vast numbers of graphics processing units, or GPUs. And they’re all looking at a new breed of chip that could accelerate AI from inside smartphones and other devices. Any choice these companies make matters, because their online operations are so vast. They buy and operate far more computer hardware than anyone else on Earth, a gap that will only widen with the continued importance of cloud computing.  If Google chooses one processor over another, it can fundamentally shift the chip industry. The TPU poses a threat to companies like Intel and nVidia because Google makes this chip itself. But GPUs also play an enormous role within Google and its ilk, and nVidia is the primary manufacturer of these specialized chips. Meanwhile, Intel has inserted itself into the mix by acquiring Altera, the company that sells all those FPGAs to Microsoft. At $16.7 billion, it was Intel’s largest acquisition ever, which underscores just how much the chip market is changing. First, Training. Then, Execution But sorting all this out is difficult—in part because neutral networks operate in two stages. The first is the training stage, where a company like Google trains the neural network to perform a given task, like recognizing faces in photos or translating from one language to another. The second is the execution stage, where people like you and me actually use the neural net—where we, say, post a photo of our high school reunion to Facebook and it automatically tags everyone in it. These two stages are quite different, and each requires a different style of processing. Today, GPUs are the best option for training. Chipmakers designed GPUs to render images for games and other highly graphical applications, but in recent years, companies like Google discovered these chips can also provide an energy-efficient means of juggling the mind-boggling array of calculations required to train a neural network. This means they can train more neural nets with less hardware. Microsoft AI researcher XD Huang calls GPUs “the real weapon.” Recently, his team completed a system that can recognize certain conversational speech as well as humans, and it took them about a year. Without GPUs, he says, it would have taken five. After Microsoft published a research paper on this system, he opened a bottle of champagne at the home of Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO of nVidia. But companies also need chips that can rapidly execute neural networks, a process called inference. Google built the TPU specifically for this. Microsoft uses FPGAs. And Baidu is using GPUs, which aren’t as well suited to inference as they are to training, but can do the job with the right software in place. To the Smartphone At the same time, others are building chips to help execute neural networks on smartphones and other devices. IBM is building such a chip, though some wonder how effective it might be. And Intel has agreed to acquire Movidius, a company that is already pushing chips into devices. Intel understands that the market is changing. Four years ago, the chip maker told us it sells more server processors to Google than it sells to all but four other companies—so it sees firsthand how Google and its ilk can shift the chip market. As a result, it’s now placing bets everywhere. Beyond snapping up Altera and Movidius, it has agreed to buy a third AI chip company called Nervana. That makes sense, because the market is only starting to develop. “We’re now at the precipice of the next big wave of growth,” Intel vice president Jason Waxman recently told me, “and that’s going to be driven by artificial intelligence.” The question is where the wave will take us.

Flickr user @jepoirrier Last year Slack, the so-called e-mail killer, integrated with e-mail. It was inevitable. Slack was built with really beautiful design, but it’s impossible to compete with a universal standard. E-mail is still the number one thing we use the internet for, and it’s still growing. “Companies have built these really big monopolistic services,” Rafael Laguna, founder of Open-Xchange, told the Observer in an interview. “They all want you to stay inside these silos.” In creating Open-Xchange, Laguna decided to pursue a completely different strategy: build apps that were completely open source, that anyone could use. His Germany-based company has grown to some 200 employees since 2008 by licensing software to major internet service providers that anyone could download and install for free. “The wireless services have learned the hard way that selling an iPhone doesn’t sell them,” Laguna explained. His company lets internet service providers white label his company’s software as a way of making their services stickier for their customers. This reporter has been looking for an alternative to Google Docs. You know what feels weird? Drafting stories about how creepy it is that Google watches you constantly in a word processor that Google built, knowing full well that Mountain View servers have read what I’m going to say about the company long before my readers do, but that access in the cloud is so helpful. The service presents two big problems. First, it uses its own format. It’s easy to convert documents to other formats, but my whole archive of writing depends on this giant company continuing to support the format. If it pulled the plug one day, I could lose everything. Second, Google watches everything users do with it, which is especially troublesome for folks who do sensitive work (such as journalists, but plenty of other professions should be careful too) So I have been on the market for a Google Docs alternative that uses a standard format for text and uses end-to-end encryption. With encryption, I can be the only person that can read it (until I want to share it with the world). Earlier this month, at the Open-Xchange Summit 2016 in Frankfurt, Greg Hill, a senior developer at Open-Xchange, gave a presentation about OX Guard, the company’s implementation of PGP encryption, and said that OX Guard would extend its encryption functionality to OX Documents. According to staff at the company, that functionality should go live in early December. Right now, users can encrypt documents stored in OX Documents, but to edit the documents they need to remove encryption, edit them and then restore encryption. It’s a bit cumbersome. When the next update goes live, a user will be able to open and edit an encrypted document by simply entering a password. I took my notes for this story using a version of OX Documents that Open-Xchange gave me access to. Its UX is not as good as Google’s. For example, inserting a link gets a bit cumbersome. SEE ALSO: An alternative to using your credit card to shop online. OX Documents right now looks like the fairly stripped down, characterless product that you might expect an ISP to offer customers, but I can live with a less charming interface if it means I’m not voluntarily building a profile inside servers that never forget. But companies really are paying Open-Xchange’s services, which leaves them free to build it out without any incentive to monetize me. Pros: Encrypted. Not feeding usage data into a giant database profiling you for better commercialization. Text documents stored in .docx, which is not an open source format, but it’s also not very likely to ever disappear at this point. Documents can be stored encrypted (and eventually can be edited encrypted). Advanced privacy features for technical users. Cons Not as pretty. Mobile app functionality lags. For example, users can’t edit documents on mobile, though they can look at them. It costs a tiny bit of money (unless your ISP is a partner, but that’s unlikely if you aren’t in Europe). The overall user experience is not quite as strong (for example, adding links is a bit cumbersome). Open-Xchange doesn’t directly offer its products to the public, but consumers can pay for access through its partners. For example, Mailbox.org offers a basic account for 1€ (euro) per month. It permits users to pay with bitcoin, which would mean that they would never even have to disclose their name to the service. Open-Xchange has hit on a clever business model. It’s allowed Laguna to successfully recruit large companies into the movement to offer online services that respect privacy. By making its software completely open and free, it has the potential to eventually get offered more and more widely, on more and more services. That’s why e-mail will never be disrupted by a closed system like Slack. That’s why most servers run on Linux, even though some of the biggest tech companies in the world wrote their own operating systems for servers. Open-Xchange has a vision that one day these open source versions of basic cloud applications could similarly spread across the internet. As they do, big companies like Google will only be able to see our work when it’s finished, rather than watching every keystroke we make along the way.

Since going on sale Oct. 20, Google's Pixel and Pixel XL Android smartphones are so popular that several versions are completely out of stock and others are apparently taking longer to get to buyers than previously estimated by Google. All 5.5-inch Pixel XL handsets in Quite Black or Very Silver are out of stock in both 32GB and 128GB configurations, while the 5-inch Pixel models in certain configurations—32GB in Very Silver and 128GB models in Very Silver and Quite Black—are shipping in two to three weeks, according to the Google Store's ordering page. Other standard Pixel models are completely out of stock, including the Pixel 32GB Quite Black version and the 32GB Really Blue Limited Edition version. "We're thrilled to see the excitement for our new Pixel phones, and frankly preorder demand has exceeded our expectations," a Google spokesman wrote via email in reply to an Oct. 27 eWEEK inquiry. "We're working to restock our inventory as soon as possible." The 32GB 5-inch Pixel phones sell for $629, while the 128GB Pixel sells for $749. The larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL handsets sell for $769 for the 32GB models and for $869 for the 128GB versions. The Pixel handsets, which Google has designed and engineered, are sold through the Google Store and Verizon, including Verizon mini-stores inside selected Best Buy stores. The company unveiled the long-rumored Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones on Oct. 4 after months of speculation. Also announced at the time was Google's upcoming $79 Daydream View VR headset, which will arrive in November. Consumers who preordered and paid for their new Pixel smartphones were eligible to receive a free Daydream View headset through a promotional code with their purchase, while supplies lasted. The standard Pixel phone has a 5-inch full HD AMOLED display, which is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 4, has a 2,770mAh battery, and is 5.6 inches tall, 2.7 inches wide and 0.3 inches thick. Its larger stablemate, the Pixel XL, has a 5.5-inch quad HD AMOLED display, a Corning Gorilla Glass 4 cover and a 3,450mAh battery, and is 6 inches long, 2.9 inches wide and 0.34 inches thick. The phones are the first Google devices to include the latest Google Assistant services built-in to assist consumers in their everyday lives. Both phone models feature a metal unibody design with curved edges, a Snapdragon 821 MSM8996 quad-core processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 memory, a 12.3-megapixel auto-focus, rear main camera with an f/2.0 lens and an 8-megapixel front-facing, fixed-focus camera with an f/2.4 lens. The two handsets can capture and play 4K video as well as 1080p and 720p video. Both models also include a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor for device and user security, fast charging that can provide up to 7 hours of use from a 15-minute charge, a USB Type-C port, a 3.5mm headset jack, a single SIM receptacle and a single bottom-firing speaker. Also included is 24/7 technical support for the handsets through a preloaded app that gives tech support personnel the ability to examine the phone remotely after the owner consents to the assistance. In addition, both handsets will include Google's new Android Nougat operating system with automatic updates in the background and free unlimited storage of photos and videos at original quality and full resolution through Google Photos. Buyers can also obtain their Pixel or Pixel XL handsets with a free SIM card that will work with Google's Project Fi mobile phone services. A two-year device protection plan is available for $99.         LATEST STORIES (4) Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Missile Hits Militants' Gathering in Southern Aleppo Hashd Al-Shaabi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Military Operations West of Mosul Anti-Trump Protests Continue across US Cities Spokesman: Iran's Missile Power Not Negotiable Tasting Justice: ISIL Being Driven Away in Iraq and Syria Iran, Russia Stress Boosting Mutual Cooperation Spokesman: AEOI Not Concerned About Trump Aides' Remarks Hashd Al-Shaabi Rescues 300 Sunni Families Battle for Mosul Day 28: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Mosul Operation Russia, Iran Plan $10bln Arms Deal Report: Russian Strategic Bombers Prepare to Strike Terrorists in Syria Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syria: Jeish Al-Fatah Declares State of Emergency in Aleppo Iran Urges Unity Among Muslim Nations Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army troops continued to hit the terrorist groups' defense lines and gatherings and seized back new regions in Western Ghouta, tightening the siege of the militant-held town of Khan al-Sheih.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Google’s deep learning computer can keep things secret Posted on October 28, 2016 by Nick Farrell - News Google Brain, Google’s deep learning project, has started protecting information from prying eyes. Researchers Martín Abadi and David Andersen found that computers  could make their own form of encryption using machine learning, without being taught specific cryptographic algorithms. OK the encryption was basic, but neural nets “are generally not meant to be great at cryptography”. The Google Brain team has three neural nets called Alice, Bob and Eve. Alice’s job was to send a secret message to Bob, Bob’s job was to decode the message that Alice sent, and Eve’s job was to attempt to eavesdrop. To make sure the message remained secret, Alice had to convert her original plain-text message into complete gobbledygook, so that anyone who intercepted it (like Eve) wouldn’t be able to understand it. The “cipher text” – had to be decipherable by Bob, but nobody else. Both Alice and Bob started with a pre-agreed set of numbers called a key, which Eve didn’t have access to, to help encrypt and decrypt the message. Initially they were rubbish at it but Alice slowly developed her own encryption strategy, and Bob worked out how to decrypt it. After 15,000 times, Bob could convert Alice’s cipher text message back into plain text, while Eve could guess just 8 of the 16 bits forming the message. As each bit was just a 1 or a 0, that is the same success rate you would expect from pure chance. The research is published on arXiv. Practical implications for the technology are limited, but it does mean that computers can develop and hide secrets from their human masters.

For those who came in late, Oracle sued Google claiming that its developers used its copyrighted material in Android.  The material in question were Java APIs which are effectively notes that developers used in framing the code. The case has been going on since 2010,  Oracle initially lost but had part of its case revived on appeal. The sole issue in the second trial was whether Google infringed the APIs in Java, which the appeals court held are copyrighted. In May, a jury found in Google’s favor after a second trial, stating that Google’s use of the APIs was protected by “fair use.” Legal experts think that Oracle’s appeal is a long shot. The four-factor “fair use” test is a subjective one, and Oracle lawyers must argue that the jury’s unanimous finding must be overturned. Oracle could focus on jury instructions that it viewed as improper, or argue that the evidence presented at trial was so overwhelming that no reasonable jury could have found in Google’s favour. If Oracle wins it could create a mess for developers. The trillions of lines of code out there might contain APIs which developers could have used without thinking. Patent trolls could buy up old software, look for dodgy APIs in others code and sue for millions. That is even without factoring in the impact of Google having to sign off billions of dollars to Oracle.

Google’s advertisements say the Pixel devices have the “highest-rated smartphone camera ever” but users are moaning that the latest Pixel phone had so much lens flare holiday snaps were looking like one of the new Star Trek movies. Now Google is developing a software fix to address excessive lens flare on photographs taken with its flagship Pixel smartphones. But some users are  alarmed that Google was trying to solve a hardware issue with a software fix. What is weird is that at a launch event in October, Google said the phones had received the highest-ever score from DxOMark, which measures camera performance. But the test acknowledged that “flaring was sometimes an issue when shooting in full sun,” but did not identify an issue with other light sources. Google said it was developing software that could spot the issue and compensate for it. Google’s Isaac Reynolds said: “We’re working on some algorithms that recognise the halo/arc flare, characterise it mathematically and then subtract it from the image.” It is a bit on the nose when the pixel costs $750.  Software is only going to doctor the photo it is not going to fix the hardware issue.

Newly discovered malware aims to create fresh IoT botnet Promoted tweet phish fiddle Malware threats in search results are getting worse despite the best efforts of Google and other vendors. The number of infected results has been increasing year by year since 2013 despite the application of multiple tools and technologies designed to exclude dodgy links, according to a study by independent anti-virus testing outfit AV-TEST.org. The analysed websites originate in various proportions from the search engines of Google, Bing, Yandex and Faroo. Additionally, over the past two years, more than 515 million Twitter updates were examined for malicious links. Last year AV-TEST.org examined 80 million websites, spotting 18,280 infected web pages. In the year up to August the testing lab inspected a similar 81 million websites turning up a much higher 29,632 infected web pages. Both results were recorded without enabling Google Safe Browsing. Both figures are a big increase on 2013 when AV-TEST encountered 5,060 malware threats after examining 40 million web pages. All of the pages with malware threats found by AV-TEST were visited using the Google Safe Browsing tools. The results were less than impressive. In 2015 the 18,280 pages with malware threats threw up Google warnings in just 555 of cases. In the year to August of 29,632 malware-tainted pages threw up 1,337 Google warnings. Links in tweets are infected at almost exactly the same rate of frequency as links filtered by Google. Graphs illustrating AV-TEST.org’s results can be found here. Maik Morgenstern, chief technology officer at AV-TEST.org, explained that the dynamic content of the web means it sees different content from Google/Bing when accessing and scanning the site. This factor, together with the appearance of malicious ads, on previously clean websites goes some way in explaining the discrepancy. "It could be the ads on the website that have been flagged as suspicious by us and that changes every time you access the site," Morgenstern explained. "Or the website is delivering different content randomly or it does so by checking the user agent or location of the user. "Also I do not know what the interval is that Google/Bing are scanning the sites for malware. There will always be a certain timeframe where malicious content could be on the site without Google/Bing knowing it, even if they were able to detect it. It is also possible that we flagged content as suspicious that is not considered suspicious by Google/Bing." Google is yet to respond to El Reg’s request for comment.

The New Statesman asked a panel of experts, including Digital Minister Matt Hancock, Tinder Foundation CEO Helen Milner, Tech City CEO Gerard Grech and Google Policy Manager Katie O’Donovan, to pinpoint the weak spots and the opportunities for a smarter digital skills strategy. By Eleanor Slinger         Print HTML British people spend more per capita online than any other country in the developed world. With 82 per cent of adults using the internet on a daily basis and more than 20 per cent of retail sales taking place online, it would appear that most British businesses are digitally capable. A closer look, however, reveals a significant digital skills gap between larger companies and the small businesses that make up 60 per cent of the private sector – comprising a workforce of over 15 million people, with a turnover in excess of £1.6trillion. Of these small enterprises, a third don’t have a website and more than half are unable to sell goods online. So, are digital skills taking priority in the government’s industrial strategy? Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture, said digital education from an early age will be a cross-party objective for years to come: “We’re making some progress on this, and one of the most exciting things we did in the last parliament was to put coding into the curriculum from age eight. We’ve recognised that there are down-the-track requirements for digital skills, as much as with English and Maths, and we’ve got a huge array of initiatives to corral the enthusiasm for digital and make sure that it is best used.” Hancock added that participation in the digital economy is important at every level of business and society: “I can group the facts and figures; 23 per cent of people currently lack basic digital skills, and about 90 per cent of new jobs now need some form of them. I think that what we’ve learnt following the Brexit vote is that the need to engage everybody is more demonstrable than ever before. This is a very important part of the Prime Minister’s agenda, and wider digital engagement is a key part of the broader issue to make an economy that works for everyone.”  It is this wider opportunity to access and education that forms the bedrock of a new partnership between Google and the Tinder Foundation, aiming to deliver digital skills training to those in society who are most in need. Cue the Digital Garage. The project sees community organisations across the country provide skills support to small businesses, sole traders and indviduals, helping them to make the most of their resources. Katie O’Donovan, Policy Manager at Google, explained: “Google has a longstanding commitment to train 250,000 people across the UK in digital skills. Since launching the Digital Garage in 2015 we’ve provided mentoring and digital skills training in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle and Glasgow.  But as the UK faces a new chapter we want to ensure, whether you’re a student looking for your first job, a small business looking to attract new customers or a musician looking to promote your music, the right digital skills are freely available in your local community. Tinder Foundation CEO Helen Milner recognised that a wider proliferation of digital skills would release a surprising amount of value into the economy. “Some of our research showed that every £1 invested in growing people’s basic digital skills put £10 back into the economy. But it’s not enough to save money - you’ve got to show how you can make money out of it as well.”     The Labour MP for Aberavon, Stephen Kinnock, has seen at first hand the benefits of support for digital skills, and welcomes opportunities for partnership in his constituency. The shift from manufacturing, he accepts, needs direction and following the depletion of his local steel works he views digitisation as “the only way forward.” Kinnock added that exciting projects such as the Swansea bay region or ‘internet coast’ becoming a testbed for 5G could serve to re-energise communities which are in many ways in a state of decline. Kinnock said: “I’m absolutely delighted that we’re going to have pop-up versions of the Digital Garage in Port Talbot.” CEO for TeenTech Maggie Philbin, meanwhile, stressed that digital education at school level must be taught through the lens of practical application. She warned: “Many young people aren’t greeted by any coherent messaging in school, so they don’t see why they’d need digital skills in the workplace. We’ve got to start getting a better message across and improve the opportunities for actual work experience that harnesses these skills.” Karen Price, CEO at The Tech Partnership shares this view. For Price, adapting apprenticeships to incorporate digital skills will help to inspire a culture of innovation. She suggested that “if that's part of an apprenticeship that could be polished to use in a business environment, you'd have a digitally capable young person who could probably move that business on in a different way.” Nick Williams, Consumer Digital Director for Lloyds Banking Group, views improving people’s digital skills as a matter of urgency and brought up research conducted by the company’s new Business Digital Index for 2016 which found that 38 per cent of small businesses and 49 per cent of charities are currently lacking digital maturity. “It’s no longer a matter of choice,” Williams said, “for organisations to survive, we must focus on a digital message.  Technology’s moved on and people just haven’t kept up. We have to show how these new skills can translate to greater productivity. Ability and access are the two variables to address. We are on the brink of going down the route of a digital divide – those who are capable and those who aren’t – and we’ve got to stop that.” Rachel Neaman, Director of Skills and Partnerships at Doteveryone, was quick to pick up on this point. She warned that any digital training must not simply be for future generations’ benefit, but also be afforded to those already in work. “What are we doing for the people who currently lack these skills? How do we stop people from being left behind?” Neaman called for an “equal emphasis” on updating and upgrading the existing workforce. Julian David, the CEO at Tech UK, was also keen to highlight that digitisation is “an ongoing process” and therefore “retraining” at regular intervals is needed to cope with a continually evolving demand. While Hancock spoke of a “unit-based standard learning system”, similar to that used in American schools, to help apply digital skills training where it is most appropriate, IPPR North researcher Jack Hunter said there were real opportunities to be grasped in the coming devolution agenda: “The new mayors that are coming in next year to drive the agenda and economic growth are going to be getting a lot more funding around a variety of different skills streams that feed directly into the digital programme.” The panel agreed that the digital divide will only grow wider if action is not taken. Director of the Action and Research Centre at the RSA Anthony Painter said that society is being split into two camps: “the confident and creative, and those who feel held back.” Painter recommended that the latter group are given a fresh chance at being empowered digitally. He said: “They don’t tend to use the internet for professional development, whereas the others do. We’ve been having a look at this locally by creating a ‘City of Learning’ which combines a digital platform built around open badges which have micro-accreditations for learning; things that if you get someone’s passionate interest and then start feeding into more formal learning opportunities then you wrap around that a sort of city-led campaign which lets them identify with a common cause – we’re a learning city.” Tech City UK CEO Gerard Grech concurred and went to explore the link between a strong web presence and business expansion or improvement. The problem identified is that many businesses may not realise the extent of their digital capabilities and thus run the risk of missing out. Grech said: “If you ask a window cleaner if they are a digital business, they might say no, but if you ask how they might go about quoting someone, they could find the address on Google Maps or get the Street View. That’s the idea, to show how digital can be used for them.” Ultimately, the panel concluded, that the enthusiasm to add a digital depth to Britain’s talent pool was validated by its potential advantages. “A lot of the major challenges facing the economy,” Painter summed up, “are actually rooted in skills. Whether it’s the challenges of Brexit or the challenges of broadband, I think if you fix the skills, everything else falls into place.” The panel agreed that any government has a responsibility to champion digital strategy throughout society, regardless of location or economic standing, and equip businesses with the digital skills required to perform at their best.   The round-table discussion was chaired by Kirsty Styles.

By Emmanuel Akinwotu Follow @@ea_akin         Print HTML In 2004, my friend and I walked into a pub in south London and sat down by a screen to watch a Premier League game. The manager at the bar walked over and told us that we couldn’t stay unless we bought a drink. I politely told him I had intended to and a minute later walked to the bar. When I asked if I could order, he refused, telling me that my friend and I should leave. My dad, who had arrived in Britain in the early Eighties had often spoken – quite animatedly, where his voice would shrill in a way that often made me want to laugh – about dealing with racism. But until then, I never internalised his experiences. Being born in Britain, of Nigerian origin but with a British accent, felt in some ways like a completely different identity and race to his. He would constantly reiterate that my name and skin colour meant that I had to be more aware of my behaviour, more determined at school, more hardworking than my white, British friends and peers. This is a common trope for African parents. But I had mostly seen his experiences in Britain as to some extent distant from my own. However, after that day, my distance from his experiences decreased. I pressed the manager for an explanation until he told us his pub “wasn’t for your type”. Rarely have I been subjected to such brazen displays of racism, as my dad experienced. But as a black, British, second-generation immigrant, your awareness of your difference, and the prejudices it can provoke, is always there. Both where it is clear-cut and less so. Black is the New Black – a new series on BBC Two as a part of the BBC’s Black and British season – brilliantly explores the experiences of black British immigrant life, and how those experiences have changed over time. In each of the two episodes thus far, interwoven conversations from a reel of prominent black British figures – Naomi Campbell, Malorie Blackman, Trevor McDonald, to name a few – make up an emotional snapshot of their lives. From the “children of the empire” – the generation that came to Britain in the Fifties and Sixties – to later generations, the show moves through more contemporary experiences of younger public figures like Thandie Newton and Reggie Yates. It highlights where their experiences diverge and which common threads persist today – from the brazen racism of signs on shop windows barring entry to blacks, Irish and dogs to the more covert kind. Each of the talking heads speak to an interviewer who stays behind the camera, and detail how their backgrounds have shaped how they feel about Britain. Some of the anecdotes are light-hearted. Trevor McDonald’s disdain for snow and the excessive number of pockets in winter jackets that he struggled with from the moment he arrived in London from Trinidad. Bill Morris, the first black general secretary of the Transport and General Workers’ Union, laughing at how his first sight of smoke coming out of chimneys made him think that houses were actually on fire. Morris, often nostalgic about first coming to Britain and living in small spaces in London that he was proud to be able to afford, was nonetheless afraid to leave his home alone throughout the Fifties – for fear of being attacked. It’s this variety of memories that the show handles so brilliantly. It airs the adventure of immigrant experiences, which make it intriguing – and close to home. Hand-in-hand with the challenges of moving to a new environment was the exhilaration of being in a place that was, in many Commonwealth countries, romanticised. Old pictures of the numerous dirty, cramped, barely affordable shared flats in Stockwell and Oval that my dad bounced between often bely the excitement with which he remembers that time. The series is also timely. Immigrant stories are increasingly portrayed as negative. Perfectly normal and widespread motives for travelling to a new place, to pursue either a better or different life, are increasingly depicted as perverse and wrong.

In a note online this week, software engineer Ryan Sleevi, clarified that any new certs issued after that time would not be recognized by Chrome. “This is a significant step forward in the online trust ecosystem. The investments made by CAs adopting CT, and Chrome requiring it in some cases, have already paid tremendous dividends in providing a more secure and trustworthy internet,” he explained. “The use of Certificate Transparency has profoundly altered how browsers, site owners, and relying parties are able to detect and respond to mis-issuance, and importantly, gives new tools to mitigate the damage caused when a CA no longer complies with community expectations and browser programs.” Any Certificate Authorities not happy with the decision are being urged to contact IETF’s Public Notary Transparency WG (TRANS). Certificate Transparency is an effort on Google’s part to fix structural flaws in the SSL cert system which black hats have been able to exploit to launch man-in-the-middle, website spoofing and other attacks. It does this by providing a framework for monitoring and auditing SSL certificates in near-real time. The news was welcomed by Venafi chief security strategist, Kevin Bocek. Yet he argued that CT only addresses part of the problem. “The challenges of using digital certificates today are more wide-reaching than when they are issued. The bigger problem is when certificates are stolen, misconfigured, or abused. This is why initiatives like Certificate Reputation, built on data from certificate transparency, will help organizations determine if certificates should be trusted at any point in their lifecycle,” he added. “This is why companies need to make sure they can establish the visibility and intelligence necessary evaluate digital certificates in real time – they will only become more and more important to security and privacy.” Why Not Watch? 2 Apr 2015Browsers, Certificates and Trust: What's Changing and What You Need to Know 21 Jan 2016Don’t Be Blind On Visibility 17 Mar 2016Will Encryption Save Europe’s Privacy Plans? 7 Jan 2016The ‘Dark’ Web Inside Your Enterprise – Shining a Light on the Hazards of Encrypted Traffic Related to This Story Google Advances Fight Against Mac Malware with VirusUploader Google cloud platform used for botnet control Google Demands Changes After More Rogue Symantec SSL Certs Found Google to Distrust WoSign/StartCom Certificates Google Switches on HTTPS for All Blogspot Domains What’s Hot on Infosecurity Magazine?

A major concern bothering a lot of my friends this year was managing the wires associated with their audio setups. While desktop PC is still something that is dear to my friends, there is definitely scope for making audio setups wireless at least. We got down to researching on it. We explore and find the best ways that you can continue listening to your tunes easily without interruption. Have you tried Bluetooth speakers? The first and most obvious answer is to get decent Bluetooth speakers that you can carry to any room for listening to your tunes. They are small, unintrusive and can be taken on trips too. Bluetooth speakers are best for lightly listening to your music in the background but certainly lack the oomph in sound if you really want to enjoy your music. For the best Bluetooth speaker choices, do check out our Bluetooth speaker guide under Rs 10,000. Make any speaker Wireless (Via Bluetooth) If you’ve an excellent home speaker system but without wireless capability, perhaps Logitech’s Bluetooth Audio Adapter is what you need. This little device is really small, has a range of 50 feet, is simple with one button to sync with your phone/tablet/laptop to play audio. The device connects to regular speakers with 3.5mm or RCA jack and this little wonder can save you thousands of rupees as wireless amplifiers/home speaker systems cost a lot more. Logitech’s little receiver costs less than Rs 2,000. Get Better Wireless experience on any speaker (Via Wi-Fi) Bluetooth is the most basic wireless functionality you can get. But, it has limitations, such as poorer/compressed audio quality (than wired or Wi-Fi), limited range, and of course typical Bluetooth headaches of steady connectivity. If you want to alleviate these problems, Wi-Fi is the way to go. Here you’ll have to ensure that you have good Wi-Fi running in the house perhaps with extenders or boosters for rooms where Wi-Fi is weak. Google Chromecast Audio This little hockey puck-shaped device set to resemble a miniature record is from Google called Chromecast Audio that is similar to their video version but does only audio with RCA, 3.5mm and Optical connections. So why use this over Bluetooth functionality? Several reasons! Chromecast has Wi-Fi inbuilt and connects through your home’s Wi-Fi network easily. So your phone connects through Wi-Fi to Chromecast audio and acts only like a remote. Chromecast audio, on the other hand, does the actual downloading and transmitting of audio, only on apps that support Chromecast of course. Here’s the ever growing list of supported apps by Google Chromecast. This not only saves battery life but also you’d get a lot more bandwidth than traditional Bluetooth when playing audio, so audio drops in sound quality are a thing of the past and the range would extend to where your Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi extender are capable of reaching. Plus if you get another Chromecast audio device, you can play the same music in many rooms at once for true Multi-room support. Unsupported apps can mirror every sound coming through your phone too if you want. Though there is a delay in the sound as it has to travel from the phone to Chromecast to the speaker. But for music it works well, videos will have 1-second syncing issues no doubt. The best part is that Chromecast apps work well with Android and iOS too. All this goodness only for Rs 3,300. However, your costs can go up if you want multi-room support (several Chromecast audio devices required) but still not as expensive as other off the shelf solutions. Apple’s Way We, of course, have Apple with AppleTV that can powerfully send not only music but movies, shows and apps (including gaming) for a full-blown entertainment experience. Getting this just for music would be horrendous under use of Apple TV. This is a full blown device for consuming video and audio content with hardware comparable to Apple’s very own iPhone 6. It is an excellent option for streaming content with one single big caveat, it is, of course, everything is Apple based. Everything from music to movies and of course games is all App Store and iTunes-based. In terms of speakers, Airplay specific speakers are also available from popular brands such as JBL for Rs 50,000 upwards for their Authentics line. If you are an ardent Apple user with an iPhone and music on iTunes, Music, this is the way to go for you especially for future functionality as streaming music is almost always the gateway to streaming videos, shows, movies, etc. If you have purchases made on Amazon or Google stores, you can almost say goodbye to accessing those libraries. This device has HDMI, Wi‑Fi, Ethernet, IR receiver, USB‑C for service and support, built‑in power supply, Bluetooth remote and IR transmitter. All this will set you back Rs 13,500 for 32GB or Rs 17,900 for the 64GB version. We certainly wouldn’t recommend this path if all you want is wireless music functionality, whether Apple user or not. All Integrated Solution If you are looking for a sleek, elegant and hi-end wireless audio solution that is “just play it and forget it”, Sonos is what you truly need. Sonos make wireless audio products such speakers, amp connects and the like. Sonos speaker systems connect wirelessly to any computer, phone, or tablet to play music just about anywhere, in every room. It can play music direct from music streaming services on the internet, such as Google Play Music, Spotify, Apple Music and more. The entire experience can be controlled easily via their Android/iOS app or Windows/Mac software. Sonos uses your existing Wi-Fi setup securely called SonosNet which connects with computers, laptops, phones, tablets including Windows, Mac and Android and iOS. If you don’t have Wi-Fi, then Sonos can hook up directly through the Ethernet ports that are available on any of its speakers. Sonos and its Wi-Fi solutions will work as far as you use their own Sonos speakers or their Sonos CONNECT:AMP which can turn your stereo or home theatre into a music streaming system. They not only have several portable solutions such as Play: 1,3,5 and a sub for deep bass but also an entire home theatre experience with their wireless home theatre setup. The only downside is that many of the streaming services that Sonos offers are not officially available in India such as Spotify, Pandora and several other US radio services. However, your own music playlists, it will work beautifully well. Expect this to cost a pretty penny with the cheapest Sonos Play:1 speaker starting at Rs 26, 000. There you have it, all the solutions available for the common Joe which are pretty much “set it and forget it” solutions for audio. However, geeks can always try the several music streaming apps on Android (that require root access) or software on Windows such as VLC by connecting up their laptop and speakers to stream music wherever they like. This is an idea for another story though. Let us know, if you have tried any of these services/solutions or have better suggestions for wireless audio streaming easily. Thanks again and have a Happy and safe Diwali.

We found the smartphone to be quite impressive (Review) as well. However, as users have begun to use the smartphone in their everyday lives, reports of glitches are now cropping up. Apparently, many Pixel phone users claim that they are having trouble pairing their smartphones with in-car entertainment systems. Many users have taken to the Pixel Community to report the Bluetooth bug. The new Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones are having trouble pairing with many cars. In some cases, the smartphones get connected and even play audio easily, but disconnect when placing a phone call. In other cases, the smartphone have difficulty in connecting, and even if they connect, they soon drop off for no apparent reason.Google is aware about the issue, and has even reached out to the affected people. This issue first cropped up with Nexus phones when Marshmallow was rolled out, and a software update fixed the issue later. This leads us to believe that the issue could have cropped up with the new Android 7.1 Nougat update, and because some Nexus users are also reporting similar issues; a software fix is all that may be required to solve the problem. While the problem is spread across different car companies, most issues are reported by General Motors vehicle owners. One big advantage for Pixel owners is that they don't have to wait for OEMs to push out the update, and will receive it directly from Google as soon as it's ready with the fix. Apart from this bug, some Pixel phone users have also reported a lens flare issue in photos when taken under certain lighting conditions. Google has acknowledged this issue as well, and has promised a fix in the coming weeks. A similar issue was also reported by iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus users earlier this month, where many users reported spotty Bluetooth connectivity with their car systems. iOS 10 was also blamed for this bug, and the latest iOS 10.1 release notes also include "improvements in Bluetooth connectivity with third-party accessories".

Though, it was initially aimed to help visually impaired people, folks at Google have found that it can be used for various other real-life applications. These include mapping and navigation, architectural designing, depth perception and gaming as well. Speaking of which....

What about its internals? As far as the specifications are concerned, the smartphone features a gigantic 6.4-inch QHD display (1440x2560). At the heart of the device is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 chipset which both Qualcomm and Lenovo claim to be tailor-made for the Tango. It packs 4GB of RAM coupled with 64GB of internal storage space which should be sufficient for a normal user. The device is backed by a 4,050mAh battery. The imaging department is taken care of by a 16MP camera at the back and an 8MP selfie shooter. Aimed for a layman? Ever since the inception of Project Tango, Google has been dreaming about commercialising it. So yes, a normal user can get hold of the device powered by Project Tango very soon perhaps as early as November 1 if you're a US resident. Indian consumers will have to wait for a while, though. How much will it be priced at? The smartphone is expected to be priced at USD 499 (approximately Rs. 33,360) which not to mention is a decent price considering the kind of innovative features it brings to the table.

By: Sneha Saha Published: Friday, October 28, 2016, 14:00 [IST] It is recently that the most widely used messaging apps like WhatsApp and Hike Messenger had rolled out video calling features for its users. Surprisingly, the newly introduced video calling features are taking over the old ones, including Google Duo. It's not so long ago that Google had come up with a simple video calling app called Google Duo. However, with the newly released video calling feature by WhatsApp and Hike Messenger, Google Duo is supposedly losing its popularity and number of subscribers. SEE ALSO: 4 Steps to Send WhatsApp Messages Without Typing On Your Android Smartphone We at GizBot have come with 5 reasons why Google Duo is losing popularity due to the new video calling feature introduced by WhatsApp and Hike Messenger. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! WhatsApp and Hike Messenger's Video Calling Feature is Easy-to-use Yes! WhatsApp and Hike Messenger users can use the video calling feature with just a click. Whereas, that's not the case with Google Duo. With Duo, it is not as easy to use for all users as people are not very accustomed to the app like they are with both WhatsApp and Hike Messenger. Google Duo Interface Restricted Just to Video Calling Yes! Unlike that of WhatsApp and Hike Messenger, Google Duo only allow users to make video calls. However, with WhatsApp and Hike, users can send messages, edit photos and so much more. Click Here for New Android Smartphones Best Online Deals WhatsApp and Hike Video Callings Feature is Faster With WhatsApp and Hike, a user can make a video call with just a click. Whereas, with Google Duo, the users first need to click on the video calling option, select the friend they want to make a call to, and then the app will use its 'Knock Knock' feature until your friend takes the call. So, with Google Duo, the users might have to wait longer. WhatsApp and Hike Have Billions of User Base As compared to that of Google Duo, WhatsApp and Hike Messenger has over billions of users across the world. This is perhaps one of the major drawbacks on Duo losing its popularity. Additionally, Duo is also not expected to match up to the numbers anytime sooner. WhatsApp and Hike Video Calling is Compatible With 2G Network If you have a 2G network, WhatsApp or Hike works perfectly. However, that's not the case with Duo. To make an uninterrupted video call, Google Duo users will need a 3G/4G connection. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today More people who go online and use Google search are more interested in looking for memes on the Internet instead of researching about Jesus Christ, data from the popular search engine showed. According to Mirror Online, Twitter user Dominik Vincent Salonen noticed how memes have already become "more popular" than Jesus using the analytics from Google Trends. Salonen, who uses the Twitter handle @Kuwaddo, came up with a graph comparing interest in the terms "meme" and "Jesus Christ" on Google, and was surprised to see how the number of searches for these humorous images online has already surpassed the number of searches for the name of the Lord. Mirror Online also did a separate graph comparing the two terms "memes" and "Jesus" using Google Trends and found out that the word "meme" became more popular than Jesus at around Christmas time in 2014. Another report from Inverse.com showed that online search interest in the term "Jesus" spiked during two Christian holidays: Easter Sunday and Christmas. The same website also found out using Google Trends that the term "meme" is also closing the gap in terms of online searches when compared with the word "God." Inverse.com also compared interest in the terms "meme" and "Jesus" in other social media platforms. In the online mobile photo-sharing app Instagram, over 13 million posts used the hashtag #Jesus. Not close behind, the hashtag #meme was used 12.9 million times as of Wednesday. "This information shows a major shift in what people are searching for, but it also proves that people are looking for more material on creations bred by the internet than the arguably most revered religious figure in history," the website stated. "As people's lives intersect with their online ones more and more, it makes sense that Jesus would be overthrown by the likes of anthropomorphic frogs and his friends," it added.

Advertising revenue made up almost 90pc of the search giant’s income, and rose 18.1pc to $19.82bn in the third quarter. Meanwhile Google's ‘other revenue’, which includes the company's increasingly important cloud business, jumped 38.8pc. Even though Google’s cost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11pc in the latest period after dropping 7pc in the second quarter revenues were buoyed by an increase in paid clicks, which an advertiser pays for only if a user clicks on them. Paid clicks rose 33pc, compared with a rise of 29pc in the second quarter. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $52.88bn in search ad revenue in 2016, or 56.9pc of the global market. Google's Other Revenue, which includes the company's increasingly important cloud business, jumped 38.8pc after rising 33pc in the second quarter. Alphabet's Other Bets generated revenue of $197m, but reported an operating loss of $865m. In the year earlier period, revenue was $141m and the loss was $980m. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving cars as well as X, the company's research facility that works on "moon shot" ventures. Up to Thursday's close of $817.35, Alphabet's shares had risen 5.1pc since the start of the year. Telegraph.co.uk Related Content Adrian Weckler: If Google buys Twitter, what happens next?

By: Reuters | Published:October 28, 2016 1:43 pm Propelled by strong advertising on mobile devices and video site YouTube, Alphabet’s net income climbed 27 percent to .06 billion. (Reuters File Photo) Google parent Alphabet Inc bested analysts’ estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday as the search company showed it has honed its core business for the mobile era and is closing in on the next wave of computing. Propelled by strong advertising on mobile devices and video site YouTube, Alphabet’s net income climbed 27 percent to $5.06 billion. Revenue jumped 20 percent to $22.45 billion, marking the search giant’s seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Watch What Else Is Making News The company authorized a $7 billion repurchase of its Class C stock, pleasing investors who had been craving more after a $5 billion repurchase last year. Google is competing fiercely with social network Facebook Inc for dominance in the fast-growing mobile advertising market. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai touted the company’s gains in the space, and was bullish about recent product launches such as the Google Assistant, the Google Home smart speaker and refinements to the enterprise cloud business. The products are aimed at the rise of voice search, which many analysts believe will succeed keyboards and touch screens as a primary way users interact with devices.

The company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $9.06, beating expectations of $8.63 a share on revenues of $22.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. Google has been dogged by concerns about how it would nudge its vast web advertising business toward mobile, but the company’s recent performance has reassured Wall Street that the transition is well underway, said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. “It’s showing that even though they’ve hit lifetime highs, there’s still room to run,” he said. Advertising revenue, the company’s lifeblood, rose 18.1 percent to $19.82 billion in the third quarter. Paid clicks, or ads for which advertisers pay only when users click on them, rose 33 percent, compared with a rise of 29 percent in the second quarter. Cost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11 percent in the latest period, but investors are willing to forgive the slump, for now, as it suggests strong mobile growth, said analyst Kerry Rice of Needham & Co. YouTube continued to post robust gains, Pichai said. Over the past year, Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc have all doubled down on video, a format where advertisers are willing to pay a premium for a few seconds of users’ undivided attention. Advertising accounted for 89.1 percent of Google’s total revenue in the quarter, and analysts are eager for the company to tap new sources of growth. One of the leading contenders is Google’s cloud business, which drove a 38.8 percent rise in the company’s “other revenue.” “As we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment,” Pichai said. A relatively late entrant to the cloud business, Google is trying to steal market share from industry leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp. Amazon on Thursday reported a 55 percent revenue increase in its cloud business. “I would hesitate to say they are competing head-to-head, but they are making up for lost ground,” Rice said. Alphabet’s “Other Bets” unit generated revenue of $197 million, primarily from Nest, Google Fiber and Verily units, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the call. Alphabet said this week it was pausing the rollout of Fiber, a high-speed internet service, in some U.S. cities and that its leader, Craig Barratt, would leave. Porat played down analysts’ concerns of instability at Other Bets, which has suffered a wave of executive departures, including Nest founder Tony Fadell, self-driving car technology chief Chris Urmson and, most recently, Barratt. “As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it’s inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,” Porat said. Other Bets, which also includes research unit X, reported an operating loss of $865 million, down from a year-ago loss of $980 million. The narrowing loss suggests Porat is instilling the financial discipline investors have long hoped to see from the company, said Gillis.

By: AP | San Francisco | Published:October 28, 2016 1:53 pm A decade after Google bought the video site YouTube amid widespread skepticism, YouTube is playing a increasingly important role in the internet company’s current success and future ambitions. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File) YouTube has emerged as a break-out star in Google’s cast of services as the online video site upstages cable television for a younger generation of viewers looking for amusement, news and music on their smartphones. The trend is contributing to an advertising shift away from traditional network television programming to the more eclectic and diversified mix of clips ranging from cute cat videos to sobering shots of street violence found on YouTube. Watch What Else Is Making News As more advertising dollars flow to YouTube, it’s making the already hugely profitable Google even more prosperous. In a third-quarter report released Thursday, Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., said it earned $5.1 billion, or $7.25 per share, a 27 percent increase from the same time last year. After subtracting advertising commissions, revenue climbed 21 percent to $18.3 billion. Both figures topped analyst projections. All that money is providing Google with more financial firepower to buy the rights to stream cable networks’ shows on YouTube, too, something likely to reel in even more viewers. It also is helping to finance Alphabet’s investments in far-flung projects ranging from self-driving cars to internet-beaming balloons. That segment, known as “Other Bets,” lost $865 million during the July-September period, narrowing from a $980 million setback last year as Alphabet imposed more expense controls.

At that juncture, YouTube consisted mostly of crudely made videos shot by amateurs and clips pirated from movie and TV studios that were threatening to sue the site into oblivion. It had built a worldwide audience of about 72 million viewers when Google took control in November 2006. Since then, YouTube has evolved into a far more polished channel that has spawned unlikely stars such as “PewDiePie” (Swedish comedian Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg) while largely making peace with studios by creating an automated screening system that detects pirated content. YouTube says it has paid more than $2 billion to studios that have chosen to leave their material on the site and share in the ad revenue generated by their clips. Meanwhile, YouTube’s audience has surpassed 1 billion, with 80 percent of the viewers outside the U.S. YouTube also boasts that its site reaches more people between the ages of 18 and 34 years old, the “millennial” generation, than any cable network. That segment of YouTube’s audience is a major reason why more than half its video clips are watched on mobile devices. Google CEO Sundar Pichai likened YouTube to prime-time TV “for the mobile world” in a Thursday conference call that was streamed on YouTube. He told analysts that YouTube “continues to shine” as more major advertisers promote their brands on the site. Alphabet doesn’t disclose how much money YouTube is making, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates YouTube’s annual revenue has now reached $10 billion and is increasing by as much as 40 percent a year. The growth makes YouTube “one of the strongest assets fundamentally on the internet today,” Mahaney wrote in a research note earlier this week. Still Lacking Despite its progress, YouTube has been slow in realizing its full potential, leaving it vulnerable to new challengers for viewer’s attention, such as Facebook’s Live video feature, says Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson. The problem, as Olson sees it, is that YouTube has had trouble persuading TV and movie studios to license more of their content on their site, something that that might have made YouTube as dominant in video as Google is in search. But YouTube could be on a major breakthrough, according to a report published earlier this month in The Wall Street Journal. Citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Google had reached an agreement with CBS to include its network in a cable-like service called “Unplugged” that will debut on YouTube next year. Google is also negotiating for the rights to the Fox network, ESPN and NBC, among others, the Journal said. Google cited YouTube licensing rights as one of the reasons that its costs to generate revenue, excluding ad commissions, rose by $1 billion, or 30 percent, from last year. “The dam appears to be finally cracking” for even better content to come to YouTube, Olson said.

Google Pixel May Have Bluetooth Pairing Issues with Vehicles GO The issue may be related to Android 7.1 Nougat Oct 28, 2016 08:09 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google released its latest smartphones in early October and it seems that they may be experiencing an issue that was found on Nexus phones last year. Apparently, some Pixel owners have complained that the phones have Bluetooth pairing issues with vehicles. Some Pixel owners have taken to the Pixel Community forum (via Android Police) in order to express their discontent with the fact that these smartphones might experience Bluetooth pairing issues with certain vehicles. The flaw causing the issue is difficult to identify, as some users are unable to connect quickly and stream audio, while calls fail and Bluetooth disconnects. Others say they can connect, but with some difficulty and the connection sometimes drops off for no apparent reason. In addition, some users mentioned that Nexus smartphones running Android 7.1 Nougat preview are facing the same issues. The Google Pixel phone was rooted This means that the problem might be with the latest Android OS version, not with the Pixel phones. Google support team has acknowledged the problem, but some time may pass until the company pushes out a direct update to solve the issue. A few days ago, we reported that the bootloader on a Pixel phone sold through Verizon was unlocked, and it seems that today, Chainfire XDA dev announced on Twitter that he managed to root a Pixel smartphone. However, it will take a few days until the dev completes automating, cleanup and packaging tasks, before making the root method public. The dev managed to achieve a full systemless root with “/system fully intact dm-verify switchable, and boot image mods only.” Rooting a smartphone does provide users with access to various tweaks and changes that they can make to the phone, but the method voids warranty on some devices, so it’s best to use OS customization options if you don’t have experience with rooting smartphones. #Google#Pixel#Bluetooth pairing#Root#Bootloader subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Updates Allo with Split-Screen Support and Direct Reply Google's Pixel Phone Is 50% Off at T-Mobile Google Posts Video on Switching from an iPhone to a Pixel Bootloader on Google Pixel Phone Sold Through Verizon Has Been Unlocked OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2 Mozilla Firefox 50.0 Now Available for Download, Brings Built-in Emoji on Linux    Pixel and Pixel XL New Android APKs Wire APK: Updated November 14th, 18:30 GMT Hub Keyboard APK: Updated November 14th, 18:29 GMT VICE APK: Updated November 14th, 15:05 GMT NHL APK: Updated November 14th, 15:01 GMT BBC iPlayer APK: Updated November 14th, 14:59 GMT LinkedIn APK: Updated November 14th, 14:53 GMT Trip Tracker APK: Updated November 14th, 14:35 GMT Reader comments Pictures and Specs of Google's Canned Project ARA Smartphone Leaked Out more on: Project Ara i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Featured links to other websites Google can help find cheap flights October 28, 2016 A LITTLE-used Google feature can point the way to significant savings in flight costs  giving a view of the best times to fly and the best fares for months ahead. Available online at google.co.uk/flights or as a smartphone app, it is simple to use: just type in the airport to fly from, your destination, the number of people travelling and a starting date (any date) and the search engine will come up with a range of prices over the months ahead. It also shows, in green, the cheapest flights for any given day  and you can sign up for alerts for when your intended flights become cheaper and also get warnings if the fares are starting to rise significantly. Google says that its Flights app uses data on previous fares and their evolution plus probability studies on future fare changes. No one on the Connexion team has used Google Flights  the updated version was only released a few days ago  but we ask readers who have used it or another fare-finding tool to get in touch with their views. Stay informed: Sign up to our free weekly e-newsletter Subscribe to our monthly newspaper The Connexion. News analysis, features and practical help for English-speakers in France Indeed, we would like to hear any tips on the best time to book and how you find your cheapest fares: Is Tuesday really the cheapest day of the week to book? Is March really the cheapest month to fly to Nice? Is flying direct always the best option? Get in touch at: news@connexionfrance.com Millions use Skyscanner but it works a bit differently to Google as it collates 'real' fares from online travel agents and well as airlines. However, it does not look as clean on the screen. Looking at your chosen route (although it has a no destination option for those who just want to get away) Skyscanner gives a range of options from cheapest route to quickest and with fewest stopovers  which is much needed for winter flights from France  and also has a whole month option if you have a choice of dates. It says the best flights can be found by booking seven days in advance, signing up for email alerts from your favourite airlines, thinking about airline credit cards to save air miles, booking on a Tuesday afternoon (when airlines launch cheap weekend fares), book single flights with different airlines for flexibility, check on free cancellations and watch if fares get cheaper just before the day.       Website design by MyWebSpinners.com..
