Sure, you might stumble upon a ZIP file chock full of quality scribblings every once in a while or a well-curated storefront here and there, but acquiring wallpapers is a generally arduous undertaking. It’s a process, in fact, that can take almost as much time as choosing one. Well, Google’s here to help. On Thursday, the Mountain View, California-based giant released a new app for Android, Wallpapers, that packs an extraordinary number of illustrations, images, and photography with which to spruce up your mobile. In terms of functionality, Wallpapers is relatively bare bones. It’s in essence a curated portal: open the app and you’re presented with dazzling collections of satellite imagery from Google Earth, a Google collection drawn from its topographical mapping service; landscape photography from partners like 500px; architectural highlights by city, region, country, and continent; a variety of textures and materials; and artwork of a generally abstract nature. Every wallpaper in the collection includes an “explore” tab that provides details on the artist, and, if applicable, the location. Related: Google Pixel XL review If you’re the indecisive sort, there’s an option to set a live wallpaper that’ll rotate the artwork on your device’s home screen every day. And if you’re lucky enough to have a device running Android 7.0 Nougat or later, you can set different images for both your home screen and lock screen. If all that sounds a little familiar, that’s probably because Google’s Pixel phones ship with a similar set of wallpaper customization tools. In fact, the new Wallpapers seems almost identical in appearance to the Pixels’ artwork picker, down to the Wallpaper app’s “live wallpapers,” or animated artwork of the Earth from outer space, solar phenomenon, and scenic vistas. That last bit’s a tad unexpected: Google has previously implied that live wallpapers would remain exclusive to its newly-launched Pixel smartphones. “Wallpapers serve as the very first touchpoint for users and help establish a premium experience and build an emotional connection,” Google wrote in a blog post announcing live wallpapers. “For the Pixel, we wanted to design an experience that was both inherent and unique to Google.” But the surprise is a welcome one — in this writer’s opinion, the search giant’s live wallpapers are by far the collection’s most entrancing.

It’s compatible with Android devices running Android 4.1 and above. Also watch: We put the new Google Pixel XL smartphone through its paces – so how did it do?

If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In a story Oct. 19 about LeEco's entrance into the U.S. market, The Associated Press erroneously reported the address of the company's online store. It is LeMall.com, not LeWeb.com A corrected version of the story is below: China's LeEco sets out to shake up US consumer tech market Story continues below video × Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Technology Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco's online store, LeMall.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China." LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem," is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us," LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users." Innovation in the U.S. has hit a "bottleneck," making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as "Trojan horses," to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives." Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. consumer electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other prominent chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California, with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, California, where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex "EcoWorld." "They are not taking a half-baked approach," Goertz said. "But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?" Jia, who has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $5 billion, will shoulder a huge chunk of any losses because he owns half of LeEco. He declined to say how much LeEco has spent in the U.S. so far. "We are financially prepared to bring a new model and a new value for the U.S. consumers," Jia said.

In fact, unlike Nexus phones from Google, the new Pixel phones even managed to generate some interest outside the enthusiast crowd thanks to the recent cancellation of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7. Android users are in search of a new star now that Samsung's most recent flagship phone is more than seven months old, and Google's first self-designed handsets could be just what the doctor ordered. Early reviews were mostly positive, though bloggers who didn't like the phones really didn't like them. Google Assistant is a bright spot and the Pixel's rear camera really shined as well, even managing to capture more impressive photos than Apple's iPhone 7 Plus in many cases. But a new test reveals that there's another key area where Google's new Pixel XL is no match for Apple's flagship phablet. DON'T MISS: These are the 2 best iPhone email apps in the world, and I can’t decide which to use There are a few features that always seem to be at the top of every list when consumers are surveyed about the things they consider most when buying a smartphone. Camera quality is absolutely near the top of the list each time, and the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus both have you covered in this important area. The #1 answer is almost always battery life though, and Apple's phablet beat the newest Google phone by a wide margin in one recent test. Mobile blog Phone Arena put both phablets through its standard battery test, which is intended to measure how long a smartphone battery lasts during continuous "typical" use. According to the site's tests, the new Google Pixel XL lasted for an admirable 7 hours and 19 minutes, one minute longer than Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge. But the iPhone 7 Plus ran for 9 hours and 5 minutes, crushing the Pixel phablet by nearly 2 hours. screen-shot-2016-10-20-at-3-03-27-pmMore Trending right now: Nintendo’s Switch is everything the Wii U should have been, but it might be too late These are the 2 best iPhone email apps in the world, and I can’t decide which to use If you have a black or jet black iPhone 7, you need these wallpapers See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump is already proving he has no idea what he is in for Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Online freedom hit by pressure on social media, apps AFP New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (3) Post your comment Amazon Echo Dot 2nd gen available now, save with smart home bundles 20 October 2016 Amazons Echo has been a great success, and it took a while for Google to finally catch up to the online retailer giant when it finally introduced its own home assistant, Google Home. The Amazon Echo is now smaller and more affordable than ever before. You can get one for $50 starting today from Amazon US, and available for £50 in the UK where the original Amazon Echo only launched last month. This is the second generation of the Echo Dot which took the original home speaker and left the smart listening mics that are found at the top. The only caveat was that you needed to use your own speaker. The new Echo Dot has its own speakers, gets rid of the rotary-style volume control at the top, and trims some of the fat as its even smaller than the original Echo Dot. The new Echo Dot is the most affordable way to buy into the smart/connected home ecosystem. If you already plan on getting a Philips bridge or smart thermostat, Amazon is offering bundles that can help you save, as well as a 6-pack bundle (buy-five, get-one-free for $250 or £250) if you want to have Alexa in every room of your house. Use the code: DOT6PACK during checkout. Amazon Echo Dot Gen 2 in Black or White The bundles can save you anywhere from $10 to $50: (US)Echo Dot + Bose SoundLink Mini II (Carbon or Pearl)  $214 (Save $35) (US)Echo Dot + Philips Hue Starter Kit - $100 (Save $20) (US)Echo Dot + TP-Link Smart Plug - $70 (Save $10) (US)Echo Dot + ecobee3 Smart Thermostat - $250 (Save $50) (UK)Echo Dot + Netatmo Thermostat - £149 (Save £41) Bundles with savings of $50 basically mean a free Amazon Echo Dot.

There were many more things outed that day, two of which are now finally available to order. We're talking about the Daydream View VR headset and the 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra. Both of these can now be ordered from the Google Store, while the Daydream View is also listed by Verizon. The carrier says it will ship by November 16, while Google is being more vague, putting its shipping estimate in the "2-3 weeks" region. Either way, it looks like both of these are set to become available at some point in mid-November. That goes for the US - elsewhere things are less clear. Remember, if you pre-ordered a Pixel, you're going to receive a Daydream View for free. To take advantage of this offer, look for an email from Google that will contain a code for your free VR headset.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise How to Choose The Right Keywords to Optimize For SEO October 17, 2016 SEO Jacob MillenOctober 17, 2016 845SHARES 3.5KREADS 845SHARES 3.5KREADS Jacob Millen 845SHARES 3.5KREADS Arguably the most important aspect of writing or editing an article with search engine optimization (SEO) in mind is choosing the best target keyword phrase. It can also be one of the trickiest strategies of content SEO to master. But if you choose the right keyword phrase for a given article and weave it into an engaging and well-written piece, your article could be well on its way to a page one ranking in search engines for that phrase. The target keyword phrase should be a two- to- four-word phrase (maybe even more words) that conveys the article’s core topic or message. While a given article might rank in search engines for a handful of different keyword phrases, the target phrase best conveys what the article is about and thus is emphasized more than other keyword phrases. If you could wish for your article to rank highly for any phrase, this would be it. Beyond the importance of shooting for a page-one ranking, there are at least three additional reasons why the target keyword phrase is so critical. It will make up a significant portion of your headline and meta title — usually the first part of your article a potential reader will see. It’s in those nanoseconds when you’re most likely to hook or miss a potential reader. The research you put into choosing the target keyword phrase can trickle down to the rest of the article. What you don’t choose for the main phrase can become secondary keyword phrases that will enrich the article’s deck, intro, subheads, etc., further enhancing the article’s clout in search engines’ indexes. Studying the keyword phrases people search for will make you a better writer and editor. Simply put, the research gives you insight into how your potential audience thinks about and looks for information. Below is a step-by-step look at how to choose the best target keyword phrase for an article, including a hypothetical example to illustrate the steps. There can be plenty of nuances to this setup depending on different situations, but the basic steps can be applied whether you are writing or editing and whether your article is an online-original or the digital version of your latest magazine piece. After you have a headline with a strong target keyword phrase, don’t consider your SEO work done. The best SEO isn’t just bolted on to an article or to the editorial workflow. What you learn via keyword research can be applied throughout the whole writing or editing process to improve the article’s readability and findability. The ultimate goal here isn’t to just please the search engines’ algorithms. It’s to make an article better for and more easily accessible by its potential audience. 1. Consider The Article What is its main topic? Not broadly, but specifically. What is its main reader benefit? What questions does it answer? Example: An article about the advantages and disadvantages of cork flooring — why it’s “green,” its pros and cons for different rooms in a house, different options of colors and textures, how much it costs, etc. 2. Brainstorm Your Keywords Before you go anywhere near a keyword research tool, ask yourself what you would search for if you wanted to find an article on this topic. Scribble down a few phrases of varying lengths, but nothing shorter than two words (more on that later). Example: cork flooring, cork flooring cost, is cork flooring green?, cork flooring uses, cork flooring options 3. Do Your Keyword Research My favorite resource for this step is the Google Keyword Planner. There are numerous keyword research tools out there with a variety of different options. Some of them are free; some are not. For me at least, it’s hard not to use the tool from the No. 1 search engine. When you open the (free) Google tool, start by entering the best phrase(s) from your brainstorm list in the “Word or Phrase” box. Leave the “Website” box blank, unless you want to limit the results to keywords that bring your website traffic. 4. Review The Results At the top of the results list, you’ll see the phrases you searched for. Below that will be related phrases. The columns to the right of the phrases show search volume and trends in different ways, and there are a few options to sort and customize the information. After you have your feet wet with this keyword tool, check out those customization options. But for now, I recommend focusing on the Global Monthly Searches column. Jot down the search volume numbers for the phrases you searched for and any of the related phrases that truly reflect what the article is about. Avoid phrases that aren’t natural language because they will be difficult to work into headlines and the text (more on that below). You may need to repeat steps three and four a couple of times to find good phrases, or you might find great options right away. Example: cork floors (90,500), cork flooring (74,000), cork flooring pros and cons (5,400), cork flooring prices (1,600), cork flooring cost (1,000) Even though you’re looking at bunches of numbers, don’t forget that those numbers represent real people using search engines to find the information your article might provide. If you’re unsure whether a particular phrase matches the article’s topic, or you’re looking at words that can mean different things in different contexts, Google the phrase. The results will show you what the search engine regards as relevant results for that phrase. Googling the phrase will also reveal the competition for that phrase (both who and how much). 5. Resist The Temptation of Big Numbers I know I said to focus on the Global Monthly Searches column, but don’t just run with the short and broad phrase that has the highest number of searches. Your odds of ranking on page one will be higher for a more specific phrase that gets less search activity. It’s far better to rank on page one for a phrase that gets a few thousand searches a month than to be on page 19 for a phrase that gets a few hundred thousand searches a month. The trick is to look at phrases that most accurately reflect what the article is most specifically about and then use the numbers to weigh the different options within that. There’s no magic number of search volume to choose or ignore. I’ve found that, for people who are new to SEO, choosing one phrase out of the options is the hardest part of optimizing content and that the temptation of big numbers is hard to resist. It’s really important to focus on the relevancy of the phrases and use the different search volume numbers more so as a tiebreaker than a compass. Example: In this case, all the phrases related to cork flooring are specific enough for consideration. But say the writer had turned in the article with a vague headline like “Great Flooring Option for Green Homes” or “Great Green Flooring Option.” “Flooring” (4 million) is way too broad and too big. “Green homes” (74,000) isn’t necessarily too big but is broader than the specific topic of the article. And “Green flooring” (6,600) isn’t specific. Say the author used a headline like “Why Cork Makes for Great Floors.” The problem with that is that it doesn’t really target any phrase. It doesn’t cover “cork floors” (90,500) because there are other words in between. 6. Choose The Long Tail After you have experience researching keyword phrases, if you still have trouble weighing the options and/or feel the temptation to choose vague phrases with super-high search volume, try this: You can get a sense of the ideal search volume for your topics and website by using Google Analytics. Look up the top entrance keywords for your website, then enter those phrases into the keyword tool. Then compare their search volume to the number of visitors they actually bring to your website. You might be surprised that some of the most continually productive entrance keywords for your website don’t have huge search volume. Enter the Long Tail theory. Whereas a shorter and more general phrase may have a much higher search volume than a longer and more specific phrase, the people searching for the latter are on a more focused and determined path. Generally speaking, when people search for short and broad phrases they are in early research mode and they’re likely to refine their search quickly to something more specific. When people search for a longer and more specific phrase, they are closer to making a “conversion,” which could be any or all of the following: read the article, share it on Facebook, sign up for your newsletter, subscribe to your magazine, etc. These days, ranking for long tail keywords is more important than ever. People are becoming increasingly savvy with using search engines at the same time as the amount of information those engines access continues to expand exponentially. On a related email exchange with Josh Loewen Co-founder at The Status Bureau, he mentioned that “Nearly 60 percent of search queries are for three words or more, and the fastest growth in number of searches is for six- to seven-word queries”. Example: “Cork flooring pros and cons” caught my eye from the beginning. It conveys the content of the article and speaks to an audience that knows about cork flooring, but needs to know if it’s right for them. And this phrase is especially advantageous with the next tip in mind. 7. Double Up If You Can Know that if you target a multiple-word phrase, you’ll also effectively target the words and phrases within that phrase. A win-win scenario is when a high-volume, broad phrase is verbatim in a longer and more specific keyword phrase. Example:  “Cork flooring pros and cons” effectively covers both that phrase and “cork flooring” (74,000) 8. Write The Headline Look at your short list of target keyword phrase options and write different headline options for the article. If you want the article to rank on page one for the phrase, odds are the phrase needs to be in the headline. Your best bet is to start the headline with the target keyword phrase. If that’s awkward, place the phrase as early in the headline as possible. A strong keyword phrase early in the headline will please the search engines’ algorithms. It also will hook the attention of quick-moving readers when they see the exact same phrase they searched for in a headline on a search results page. Keep in mind that your final headline needs to be clear and engaging, with natural language. The last thing you want is a franken-headline that makes the reader do mental acrobatics to understand it. Example: “Cork Flooring Pros and Cons” is pretty strong. Ideal headlines for SEO are a little longer (about six to 12 words), but I think adding another phrase to this headline would make it awkward. This example isn’t an especially challenging one, but it’s not uncommon for a headline to fall into place like this once you have a good target phrase. 9. Weave It In If you want an article to rank for a given phrase, it must be in the article. If it works naturally, use the target keyword phrase again in the deck and subheads of the article. If not, use secondary phrases. Definitely use the target phrase at least once within the article’s introduction. Then sprinkle it here and there throughout the piece. There’s no magic number for this — too little or too much will depend on the context of the article and what the search engine considers natural for that topic. Generally speaking, for a feature-length article, aim for at least three uses in the body copy: intro, middle and conclusion. But don’t force it. “The target keyword phrase should be a valuable phrase for the article, so using it a handful of times shouldn’t be awkward,” said to me Mariia Lvovych the founder of Getreviewed. “If you find yourself struggling to rewrite a sentence to get the phrase in there for the Xth time, stop” she continued. Example: It should be easy to use “cork flooring pros and cons” in the introduction and in the conclusion. But it may not be natural to use it more than that, which is fine. 10. Use Secondary Phrases Phrases from the cutting room floor are great for to use in the deck, subheads, body text, etc. You may even discover new ideas for related articles or sidebars. Example: Phrases such as “cork flooring durability,” “cork flooring installation,” “cork flooring prices” may naturally be in the body text and lend themselves to subheads. All of this may sound like a lot of steps, but with practice, you’ll find that the whole process generally moves swiftly and smoothly for most topics. Each time you do it, you’ll get faster, and you’ll learn something new. The payoff can be enormous — 15 to 30 minutes of work in choosing and applying a target keyword phrase can lead to thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, more people reading your hard work. Plus, you’ll become a better writer/editor because you will be all the more in touch with your audience.

Just wondering what other tools you might suggest for researching keyword volume, since Keyword Planner data may now be limited for some? Scooby Moz Keyword tool works well, but if you don’t pay for it, you are limited to a few uses a day. Scooby Unless Google Keyword Planner has changed since August, unless you spend a significant amount on Adwords, the data you get will be almost useless. It throttles data on low spending adwords accounts or free keyword research. Rahul Tripathi I totally agree with Point No 6 “Choose The Long Tail” because as my experience Long tail keywords throw we get ranking easily and also get more traffic. So as my opinion always select long tail keywords. By the way thanks for sharing this article. Deon Christie Excellent post, great read. Keywords are exactly where most newbies go wrong, and I agree with Rahul. Long Tail Keywords are not only great for ranking but is also the key to Buyer Traffic, the “Trick” is to offer something (That Actually Works). When someone types “crm software for small business”, then that is exactly what they are looking for, and most probably are interested in buying.

Startup That's Whipping Up Infographics for Thousands of Newspapers in the U.S. Graphiq has a growing database of more than 10 billion interactive charts and graphs. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT Graphiq, an artificial intelligence startup that specializes in creating interactive infographics, on Tuesday announced a partnership to distribute its charts through the Associated Press.

CREDIT: Courtesy Company Advertisement The world's oldest newsgathering organization is getting a little help from a young tech startup to bring to life facts and figures for readers. The Associated Press and Graphiq, which specializes in using artificial intelligence to rapidly create interactive data-driven infographics, announced a new partnership Tuesday. Through the AP, Graphiq will distribute its library of more than 10 billion interactive charts and graphs (the company calls them "visualizations") to the wire service's thousands of news clients around the globe, the two companies told Inc. The partnership, whose financials were not disclosed, will make it easier for the AP to provide data infographics for its stories while exposing Graphiq to a worldwide user audience. "Today we're reaching hundreds of millions of readers a month, but the AP reaches half the world's population every day," Alex Rosenberg, Graphiq vice president, told Inc. Rosenberg noted that Graphiq will embed some of its staffers in AP newsrooms to be readily available throughout the news outlet's reporting process. "By partnering with them, we're really becoming a part of their reporting cadence and workflow, and we're getting access to a huge uplift in scale," said Rosenberg. Though it is nearly eight years old, Graphiq remains relatively unknown despite providing visualizations for major media players such as USA Today, Reuters, Forbes, CBS News, and NBC News. "We span everything from Zika virus to ISIS attacks to thousands of other subjects," said Kevin O'Connor, Graphiq CEO and founder. "Any kind of iteration of information that you want to dissect, we dynamically create visualizations on that on the fly." Before Graphiq, O'Connor was one of the entrepreneurs behind DoubleClick, the Google-owned network that is used by brands and marketers to purchase and place online ads. DoubleClick was a resounding success. O'Connor said he sees the same kind of potential for Graphiq. Thus far, Graphiq has raised $32 million over several rounds from various investors, including Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers and Pritzker Group. The company has not disclosed its valuation, but Graphiq is estimated to be worth between $100 million and $150 million, according to Zirra, a startup that uses A.I. tech to analyze the private tech market. "What we're working on today, people are going to realize it's extraordinarily strategic," O'Connor said. "You can see it happening with the Amazon Echo, Siri, Google Now. Rather than making people think like computers, we're making computers think like people." Until about a year ago, Graphiq had been known as FindTheBest and it specialized in so-called vertical search engines that could help you find information for any specific subjects of interest, similar to how Yelp shows you results for local shops and how Kayak helps you find travel information. After more and more reporters began using and embedding FindTheBest's visualizations into their stories, the company was prompted to formally launch a tool for journalists a year ago. The company changed its name to reflect this new strategy, and it also began reaching out to publishers to form partnerships to get its visualizations into more news stories. Among the first outlets Graphiq contacted was the AP. For the past year, Graphiq has worked with the AP's data team to help provide visualizations for a couple of stories every week, setting the foundation for the partnership, which was announced Tuesday. Now, the two will exponentially scale up the number of AP stories that come with Graphiq visualizations. The AP will also make Graphiq's entire visualization catalog--the company creates thousands of new visualizations each week--readily available to news wires' countless clients. This will make it easier for newsrooms to include graphics--which typically are time-consuming to create--with stories as news breaks. "What this means is we can turn [visualizations] around really quickly and deliver them to customers really fast as the story is still developing," said Brian Carovillano, vice president of U.S. news for the AP. The challenge, however, will be ensuring that Graphiq's visualizations provide the level of accuracy the AP's clients and readers have come to expect. If the company fails to deliver or embarrasses the wire service with corrections or falsehoods, it could turn out to be a major misstep for the small startup. "AP has pretty strict editorial standards around accuracy," Carovillano said. "We spent quite a bit of time with [Graphiq] just making sure that it met all those standards, and it's been really good." For now, though, Graphiq is focused on the AP and the vast, worldwide audience to which it has just been introduced. "If we can get a visualization or other media assets into a majority of news stories ... that's important," O'Connor said. "And the AP is a big part of the news."

Google Flights/Screenshot Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email The days of trying to navigate an airline’s website to find the cheapest flights are behind you. With Google Flights, customers will never have to search for “the best day of the week to buy airline tickets” or wonder “how far in advance should I book my flights?” again. The travel app just released new features to help users who plan to travel this holiday season. Let’s start with Google Flights’ newest feature: Alerts that ensure you won’t pay sky-high ticket prices. 1. Enable notifications to alert you when prices are expected to change Google Flights/Screenshot Now after selecting a flight on the Google Flights app on your phone, a notification appears to alert you when the current fare is expected to expire. By pressing “learn more,” you can also see how much you can save if you book at that specific moment. If you’re still not ready to buy a ticket on the spot, don’t worry, you can set up a price alert to email you whenever prices are expected to change. 2. Find the cheapest day or month to fly Google Flights/Screenshot Most people don’t think to click on the actual calendar featured on the Google Flights homepage. But if you press the small calendar icon located in the top left corner, you’ll notice prices listed for any given day. This tool works to identify prices for both round trip and one way tickets. 3. Discover destinations based on your interests Google Flights/Screenshot This one’s for all of the indecisive travelers out there. If you want to plan a vacation, but aren’t sure where to go -- this is the feature for you. Under the explore tab, you can find ideas on destinations to visit based on your needs. For example, if you’re looking for an exotic destination for a honeymoon with good food for one week, you can click those icons and several recommendations pop up. It’s that easy. 4. Pick a random place on a map and find a price Google Flights Feeling spontaneous? But also want to stay within budget? You can quite literally pick out a random place on a map and Google Flights will give you an estimated price. Click the map that says “explore destinations,” then type in your current location and a region that you’d like to explore. For example, if you type in Europe, you’ll find dozens of red dots. Each red dot locates a popular city with transportation options. When you hover your mouse over the dot, a price will appear (see Dublin, $615). 5. Share your itinerary with friends and family members Google Flights/Screenshot It’s easy to get a second opinion on a potential vacation plan with Google Flights. Type in your location, set a destination with departure and return dates, select an airline and press “share this itinerary” located at the bottom of your screen under “track price.” You can send it to friends, family members and even yourself. Once you’re ready to book, you can click back into the link provided in the email to continue. 6. Find an ideal layover city Google Flights/Screenshot If you’re going to have a connecting flight, at least find a connecting flight in a city you may want to explore. This drop-down tool allows you to pick potential airports you’d like to connect to. Click on “more” and press the check mark for cities you wouldn’t mind connecting through. At the top, you can also adjust “duration.” Therefore, if you want to have a little extra time to explore a city, click “any duration” or adjust the hours to a time period that gives you enough time to take a little stroll around the city or grab a quick bite. 7. Focus on best flights Google Flights/Screenshot This best flights box is your best friend. When you enter all the information on your desired flight -- departure city, destination and preferred dates -- Google Flights will give you a summary of flights. At the top, you’ll see a box that says “best flights,” which lists 3 to 4 flights that will give you the most bang for your buck.  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The Google Store is now selling both the Daydream View virtual reality headset and the Chromecast Ultra. The former device is $79 while the latter is $69. Unfortunately, both of these new products are currently back-ordered. According to the Google Store, new orders of the Daydream View and Chromecast Ultra will ship in two to three weeks. The Daydream View is Google’s new VR headset works with with Daydream VR-compatible devices. Right now, that’s only the Pixel and Pixel XL, but you can still buy a Daydream View if you’re planning on upgrading to a Pixel or some other Daydream-compatible phone in the future. Meanwhile, the Chromecast Ultra is a premium Chromecast that supports 4K video and HDR. Google touts that the Chromecast Ultra also has a beefier processor for faster streaming than other Chromecasts as well as an optional built-in Ethernet adapter. If you don’t need 4K video or those other features, though, Google is still offering its standard Chromecast for $35.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Verizon really wants you to trade your iPhone for a Google Pixel Brittany A. Roston - Oct 20, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit You can grab the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones from Verizon Wireless now, and you’ll get up to a $300 credit for your new phone. Only some phones are eligible for that $300 credit, of course, included among them being the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Samsung’s Galaxy S6, S6 edge, and S6 edge+, the Note 5, LG V10 or G4, and the HTC One M9. The Daydream VR headset is also available from the carrier. Google’s newly launched Pixel phones aren’t the cheapest on the market — you’ll pay about the same as you would for a new Galaxy phone, for example. The 32GB version of the Google Pixel retails for $649.99 USD, and Verizon is offering it with a $27.08 USD monthly device fee. The 128GB Pixel, meanwhile, costs $31.24 USD per month. Google Pixel XL Review: Android embodied, for better or worse If you’d rather the larger of the two phones, the Pixel XL, you’ll be paying $32.08 USD for the 32GB version and $36.24 USD per month for the 128GB version. The Pixel’s related VR headset, the Daydream View, is also available through Verizon for $79.99 USD. With it, you can use the Google handsets to view content akin to how the Gear VR works with Galaxy phones. The Pixel phones are available in three colors through Verizon: Really Blue, which is obviously the very blue version, Very Silver and Quite Black. The Pixel sports a 5-inch FHD 441ppi display, while the Pixel is larger at 5.5-inches with a 534ppi WQHD display. There’s a lot to like about the phones, all of which we’ve detailed extensively in our Google Pixel tag portal. Check out the timeline below for more!

SUBSCRIBE 13 uses for keyword research to help you win in the search engines Google may have shifted its focus from keywords to "entities" in recent years, but columnist Stoney deGeyter reminds us that keyword research is still an important and useful part of the SEO process. Stoney deGeyter on October 20, 2016 at 2:41 pm More Ever since Google rolled out Hummingbird in 2013, there has been some question about the value of keyword research. Moving from a keyword-focused process to a topic-focused process has led some to devalue the long, arduous process of keyword research. Many wonder if it’s even worth the time. After all, if Google no longer looks at keywords (Hummingbird), and people no longer search with keywords (voice search), we don’t need to research keywords, right? Wrong! As with most predictions of the death of anything related to web marketing — how’s that fork in guest blogging going? — more often than not, they turn out to be false. And in the case of keyword research, it turns out that it’s just as important today as it was in 2012. Maybe more so. No, I don’t have a keyword research tool to sell you. But I do want to make sure that you don’t take a pass on keyword research because you think it’s no longer relevant to today’s SEO. I could give you a dozen reasons why keyword research is still important. Oh look, I have! Plus one more for good measure. :) 1. Topical niche domination There is no better way to get a full handle on any topic you want to dominate than to perform keyword research on that topic. Whether you want to write one exhaustive article or a series of articles, keyword research will show you every possible nuance of information that searchers are interested in. Not only will keyword research help you write content for your products or services, but it will also give you plenty of ammunition for all your other content, such as blog posts, e-books, white papers, infographics and more. 2. Answering burning questions Part of dominating a topical niche is answering questions that searchers have. There are great sites such as Quora and Clarity, where people ask questions that need answers, and social media is also a good place to monitor. But people still ask questions to search engines, and that presents an opportunity for you to provide the answer. Due to low search volume, keyword phrases that are questions tend to get ignored. After all, you want to optimize where the money is! But don’t disregard these questions altogether. They can be the backbone of your blog content. 3. Making existing content more robust You can always improve your content, am I write? (See what I did there?) Using your keywords provides ample opportunity to improve existing content, whether it is optimized text, a blog post or something else. I’m not suggesting you rework your content just to add in more keywords for rankings. Instead, I’m saying you can use keywords to expand the depth and breadth of your content. Keywords can help you add in new information to keep content current or fill in some missing pieces that were not included and should be. Remember, frequently searched keywords change frequently. Words that didn’t show up in research a year ago might be popular today. Continuing to perform keyword research to update your content keeps you current and allows you not only to make your content more robust but also to keep it evergreen. 4. Learning your customers’ “language” Almost every business has a handle on the industry lingo. They know what their products and services are called, as well as the language used to refer to what they do. But what many businesses don’t have a handle on is the language used by those who are less familiar with the product or those outside the industry. Keyword research uncovers the nuances of product descriptions, and even the problems that are in need of a solution. When you only use your known industry lingo, you miss the opportunity to meet the needs (let alone get the attention of) the rest of the world that is in need of your solutions. Why? Because they are looking based on their understanding, not yours. Keyword research will let you see how potential customers view your product or service and write content that speaks the same language as them. This lessens the learning curve and keeps visitors more engaged with your solutions. 5. Improving your website’s navigation One of the first orders of business for many of the sites we work on is using keyword research to improve the site’s navigation. Not only do we use keywords to establish new pages of content based on what searchers need, but those very same keywords become the link text for the navigation options. This is just another step to learning — and using — your customer’s language to meet their needs. When visitors land on your site, having a navigation that uses the terms they searched helps them find the content they want. When they don’t see familiar words, you increase the amount of time it takes for visitors to get the information they are looking for, which can lead to site fatigue. Too much of that and visitors leave in search for easier grounds. 6. New product or service research When performing keyword research, it’s important you don’t stay so narrow that you only find keywords that are relevant for you today. By broadening your search a bit, you can uncover information that can help you expand your product or service offerings for a more robust business tomorrow. Years ago, I had a client that sold bags of all kinds. Our keyword research indicated that many searchers were also interested in laptop bags. This opened up a huge opportunity for new business that they were not already targeting (or at least targeting effectively). Keyword research can show you valuable new opportunities to offer products and services that you currently don’t have. That doesn’t mean you jump on those right away, but you can keep them in the back of your mind for when you’re ready to expand. 7. Finding high-volume opportunities When it comes to delivering traffic to your website, there is nothing more compelling than optimizing for frequently searched keywords. This is one of the metrics that gives keywords value. No sense optimizing for keywords no one is searching for, right? Optimizing for high-volume keywords gives you an opportunity to get a lot of traffic to your site, which can be a boon for business. Word of caution, though: Volume alone isn’t worth justifying the optimization of a phrase. You also have to look at the quality of traffic a keyword will deliver, among other things. But when the stars align, volume can be good. Really good! 8. Finding non-competitive long-tail opportunities On the flip side of that, sometimes there are some highly profitable opportunities with the less competitive (and usually lower-volume) phrases. I’m talking low rather than no volume here. As long as a phrase has a potential to deliver traffic, it’s worth considering for inclusion in your optimization campaign. Many times, these low-volume phrases are also very low on the competition scale, which can signal a big opportunity to create content where no one else has it. And that content can deliver rankings for which no one is currently competing. Optimize for enough of these low-competition phrases, and you may find that collectively, they deliver more traffic more quickly than the high-volume phrases. 9. Increasing click-throughs from SERPs Because keyword optimization is really all about creating content that uses the same language as your visitors, it’s important for you to use your keywords in a way that will entice visitors to click from the search results to your website. This is where title tag and meta description optimization comes in. Don’t optimize just for search engine rankings. Additionally, write enticing title and meta description tags that compel searchers to click your result over competitors who are also ranked on the same page of the search results. 10. Understanding the searcher’s needs Aside from getting the click from search results to your page, you also need to deliver searchers to the page that best fits the intent of their search. Keyword research can help with this. We often think of keyword research as the process of uncovering phrases, but it is also the process of understanding them. It can often prove useful to perform a search for your keywords and assess the results. Follow a few links and look at the content. If all the results show similar content, this gives you a good idea of what searchers are looking for. If the content varies significantly, then perhaps even Google doesn’t know what searchers want. When you can determine what information a specific searcher is looking for, you then have an opportunity to drive them to the… well, that’s my next point: 11. Delivering searchers to the most relevant pages Only when you know the searcher’s needs will you be able to send them to a page that meets it. Not every search for a similar keyword wants the same thing, so you have to make sure to have content based on the need for a particular phrase. Some searchers will be researching, some buying, some shopping and some just looking for how-tos. Each of these needs requires different content. By delivering the right content for the searcher, you will keep them engaged with your site and have the best chance of turning them into a customer. 12. Assessing your competition While keyword research itself doesn’t often give you any information on your competition, you can take your keywords and use them for competitive research. Use your keywords to find out what keywords your competitors are optimizing for or bidding on. There are plenty of third-party tools that will let you do that, or you can just plug them into the search results and see what you find. While knowledge itself doesn’t help you overcome the competition, it can be used to produce a strategy that will. 13. Establishing expectations of success One of the most important factors in creating an effective digital marketing strategy is setting the right expectations. Without knowing what to expect, in terms of what success looks like and when it will be achieved, there is simply no way to “win” at web marketing. Armed with the keyword knowledge that you get above, you can set some expectations and metrics for success. This can be important for keeping the right people happy and feeling good about how the campaign is going. So I hope I have wiped away all doubt you have had about the value of keyword research. By taking the time to invest in keyword research, you not only get a list of keywords to optimize, but you can get the information necessary to ensure a successful web marketing campaign.

The success of the temporary storefront Google opened in the trendy Soho neighborhood could help the California-based company decide whether to follow Apple's lead and operate its own brick-and-mortar retail operation. The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. "This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. "We want people to come in and experience the products." Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. - 'Big battle' - A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colors. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores. Apple has a shop in Soho, too, and many more across the country and around the world. As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded, competitors have increasingly stressed "experiences" such as smoothly accessing content or services. "I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores," Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. "There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it's going to be interesting to watch." Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google's side for now because he felt Apple was "playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence." McLaughlin's verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalization has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world's most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of $53 billion, double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs.

The company says it will be extending the preview to other devices ─ presumably the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 ─ in November, with the final public release to follow later that month. The company already showed off some of 7.1’s features when it announced its Pixel phones earlier this month. Some of the Pixels’ best features will remain exclusive to those new phones. Everyone else can look forward to App Shortcuts, support for circular home screen icons, image keyboards, and more. App shortcuts is Google’s answer to 3D Touch on Apple’s iOS devices, allowing you to long-press on an app icon from the luncher or app drawer, with a list of specific actions popping up so you can jump to a specific part of the app. Unlike 3D Touch on the iPhone, the long press trigger means there is no way to move an icon without first showing the shortcuts. Actions can also be dragged out as individual home screen icons for quicker access. For now only first party apps from Google support the functionality, but with the 7.1 Preview out developers can begin building and testing shortcuts in their own apps. Android 7.1 also features reworked Quick Settings that now shows a Settings shortcut and next to it a button that slides down the full panel. There’s also a support tab under settings, support for a double-twist gesture to switch in and out of selfie mode in Google Camera, the ability for keyboard apps to now feature stickers, animated GIFs and other images. If you have one of the supported devices and are enrolled to the Android Beta program, you should be receiving a notification to update at any moment.

The virtual-reality fad of the early ’90s created scores of breathless and goofy newscasts, one terrible Nintendo console called the Virtual Boy, and the cult classic film The Lawnmower Man, which taught us that mentally challenged landscapers could become super-geniuses with telepathic powers by playing video games and having sex in VR. But by Bill Clinton’s second term, VR was essentially dead, done in by high prices, marketing that overhyped and underdelivered, and the discovery that Lawnmower Man may have been playing a bit fast and loose about the scientific facts around VR and neural enhancement. Then, in 2011, an 18-year-old named Palmer Luckey hacked together what would eventually become the Oculus Rift VR headset. It attracted the attention of John Carmack, a cult figure in video games (he was lead programmer on Doom), who took Luckey’s duct-taped prototype to the computer gaming world’s biggest trade show, E3, in 2012, where it attracted a fair amount of attention in the gaming press. The Oculus Rift would raise over $2.4 million on Kickstarter, and was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. Now, with four other large companies pursuing similar technology and several more waiting in the wings, VR is on the verge of escaping the stigma of being a fad, instead becoming part of many people’s daily lives — and not just gamers. What great virtual reality provides is something VR designers call “presence”: the bone-deep feeling that no matter what your forebrain knows ("I’m wearing a goofy cyber-BDSM mask with a bunch of wires attached while waving plastic wands), it isn’t enough to dissuade the rest of you from believing in the reality of what you're seeing ("I’m 300 feet below the ocean surface and a huge blue whale just swam by and stared me in the eye"). It works on the basic part of the human brain that we’ve had for millions and millions of years, the one that yanks your hand away from something hot, bypassing rational thought and firing off neurons. It’s a feeling both wildly exhilarating and a little humbling — a reminder that below layers of abstract thought, we’re still just walking apes who will freak out if we see a bright light come at us from the corner of our eyes. It’s an experience unlike anything else available right now. If that pitch was enough to hook you, here are the six main ways you’ll be able to try out VR this year. Photo: Evan Amos Vanamo Media/Public Domain Google Cardboard ($15) In June of 2014, Google released Cardboard — a lightweight rig that lets you use your phone a bit like an old-school Viewmaster (or, if you want to go really old-school, stereoscopes from the late 1800s). To use Cardboard, you hold the device up to your face to watch various bits of movies or play rudimentary games — though because your hands are occupied, the only way to interact with the world is by looking at it. Google was mainly using the device as a way to get a simple form of VR into the hands of a lot of people (it did two separate giveaways with New York Times Sunday subscribers, and the sets were handed out at various trade shows like toothbrushes at the dentist’s office). Think of Cardboard as the Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station of VR — the basic concept is there, even if the tech is rudimentary. Who Should Buy It? Anyone with a smartphone who wants a glimpse of VR for the cost of a cheap meal on Seamless. Samsung Gear VR ($99) While Google was working with corrugated cardboard, Samsung was teaming up with Oculus to create the Samsung Gear VR, also released in 2014 (with at least one update since). Only compatible with Samsung phones, the Gear VR uses proprietary tech from Oculus to accommodate head pitch, yaw, and roll (essentially, all the ways you can move your head around). That solved a problem facing the Cardboard, which, when used with certain phones, began to get sloppy in its motion tracking. By limiting compatibility to specific phones, the Gear VR doesn’t suffer from this problem. If you have a recent Samsung phone (uh, besides the Note 7 — you don’t want to strap an explosive to your face), were intrigued by Samsung’s ad campaign, and don’t mind laying out $100, this is a great way to experience the basic promise of VR — especially since its virtual storefront offers hundreds of games and 3-D videos to check out. Who Should Buy It? Anyone with a Samsung Phone who wants the best VR experience you can get on a smartphone (at least for the next few weeks). Google Daydream View ($79) It’s a bit harder to judge this one, since I only got a ten-minute demo earlier this week. But what I saw was impressive. Besides undercutting the Samsung Gear VR on price, the Daydream seems to have figured out the head-movement problem that plagued the Cardboard — sweeping my head from side to side was lag-free and didn’t make my stomach lurch. Other nice touches include a softer fabric on the headset (important if you’re going to wear the thing for longer than 20 minutes) and the ability to comfortably wear glasses inside the unit. But the real secret weapon of the Daydream is its included controller. While the Gear VR has a optional control pad available for purchase, it looks a lot like an XBox or PlayStation controller. The Daydream's control pad works more like a laser pointer, with just a small trackpad and two buttons, and it allows users to point and move things around naturally. An XBox or PlayStation controller makes sense to anyone raised on Halo or Grand Theft Auto, but is unnatural to anyone who didn’t. Pointing your hand at something, however? That’s something we learn to do long before we even learn how to talk. The Daydream, out in early November, will work with any phone that is “Daydream certified,” which from what I can gather means extremely fast and high-end Android phones. At launch, the only two phones that will be able to use the Daydream will be the Pixel and the Pixel XL, though Motorola, Samsung, HTC, ZTE, Huawei, Xiaomi, Alcatel, Asus, LG, and HTC all have phones coming down the pike that will run Daydream. Who Should Buy It? Early adopters of Google’s new line of smartphones who don’t mind waiting a few weeks — or anyone interested in VR and and is in the market for a new high-end Android handset. The PlayStation VR ($399 for the headset or $499 for the headset, camera, and two PlayStation Move controllers, plus $355 if you don’t own a PS4 ) This is where VR starts to get really interesting (and really expensive). The Cardboard, Gear, and Daydream all lack something called “positional tracking” — while they can match your head movements as you swivel your neck around, nothing happens when you lean forward or backward, or get up and walk around (not recommended unless you’ve cleared out some room beforehand). Those basic VR headsets simply don’t know where you are in 3-D space — only what direction your head is pointed in. The PlayStation VR, along with its higher-end brethren below, allows you to move your entire body much more normally, and the PlayStation Move controllers — essentially wireless light-up glow sticks with a few buttons — enable users to point and grab and lift in a surprisingly intuitive manner. This device also benefits from having a major console manufacturer like Sony backing it: The launch list of games is impressive, and there’s a good pipeline of more interesting titles to come. While more expensive options exist, if you’re truly curious about VR, already have a PS4, and want to get the best experience possible for under a grand, this is the system to get. Who Should Buy It? Anyone with a PS4 lying around their house and any amount of curiosity about what VR can do. The Oculus Rift (The cost of a compatible PC plus $599 for the headset. Also budget $199 for the Oculus Touch controllers, which are out in early December.) The Rift, which jump-started the rebirth of VR, has had a rough go of it since its launch in early summer. First there were supply problems, preventing early Kickstarter backers from getting their promised Rift. Then the $599 headset only included an XBox controller, which is generally acknowledged as one of the poorer ways to move around in VR, while its (genuinely excellent) Oculus Touch controllers were delayed. Compounding all that is the stiff competition on the low end from the PlayStation VR and on the high end from the HTC Vive (below), and nothing in the Oculus game library can truly be called a killer app — that one game that can compel everyone to throw down at least a grand on the headset. That said, the Oculus has the deep pockets of Facebook behind it, its Oculus Touch controllers provide the best sense yet of giving you actual hands in virtual reality, and its decision to open up development on the Rift means even a small and dedicated team of devs could create something that makes the Oculus the top VR headset. Who Should Buy It? VR enthusiasts who want to support the company that made this revival possible and/or want access to Oculus Rift exclusives. The HTC Vive (The cost of a compatible PC plus $799 for the headset) If money were no object, I had a house large enough to dedicate a room to VR, and that room had a secure lock so no one could stumble in and see me waving my arms around at imaginary stuff, the HTC Vive would be the system I'd buy. The Vive has one major advantage over the Oculus and PSVR: You can actually walk around while using it, thanks to the two sensors set up in the high corners of your room. This ability to walk around freely and safely (the system will alert you if you're about to run into a wall) changes a lot of things. You find yourself crouching down to avoid incoming fire. You can walk slowly around a table, examining everything on there as closely as possible. In one memorable moment while playing Everest VR, I was asked to step out into empty air while on the edge of a cliff high in the Himalayas. While I knew I was just in a conference room in Chelsea, it took a tremendous amount of will to actually step out — and seeing myself floating thousands of feet up was so unsettling I quickly scampered back to “safe” ground. While the HTC’s controllers leave something to be desired — it feels more like you’re holding cheap kitchen utensils than using your hands — nothing I’ve used in VR has so completely wrapped me up in a fake world. It’s not the Holodeck, but it’s the closest thing we’re gonna have for a while. Who Should Buy It? Deep-pocketed tech geeks with a lot of extra square-footage who want to experience the best version of VR currently on the market. The Unknowns We are, for all intents and purposes, in the first generation of VR (let’s pretend that what happened with VR in the early ’90s didn't happen at all). Games are still trying to figure out simple thing like how to move players around with making them get motion sickness (something I’ve experienced a few times — and I’ve never been motion-sick in my life until using VR). Companies like Microsoft, Nintendo, and Apple all seem to be edging their way toward VR, and the price of hardware will drop while the headsets get better. Meanwhile, as mobile phones become more powerful and gain the ability to use position tracking, they may become the most popular VR platform out there. But the challenge for VR is that it’s isolating, and still a bit cumbersome. You have to pull on a headset, making you effectively blind to the world around you. You can play online with other people, but the actual physical experience, no matter how much your brain is being fooled, is you sitting or standing in a dark room, by yourself. How many people who aren’t already deeply in love with video games will really want to spend their free time this way? There is another option. This summer’s craze over Pokémon Go was partly because Pokémon is insanely popular, but also showed how powerful augmented reality (AR) games could be, because instead of isolating you away in a virtual world, it layered something extra on top of the world that already exists, and forced players to get outside and explore it. Upcoming technology like Microsoft’s Hololens (which is shockingly impressive to use in person) or the long-rumored Magic Leap could give people a way to play in virtual worlds while staying firmly planted in this real world. Is the future complete immersion in an escapist virtual reality? Or figuring out a way to inject the fantastic into our everyday lives?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us CBS first to sign up with Google for upcoming YouTube web TV service By R Padla - October 20, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google and CBS are teaming up to bring consumers content and entertainment thru the tech giant’s upcoming web TV service. No confirmation or announcement yet from Google or CBS but according to a source, CBS is the first ever TV network to join the new service that will be available on YouTube. It appears that the company is really serious with getting into our homes. It’s a web TV service that can be experienced right on YouTube. We’re expecting it to roll out early next year, changing the game of TV viewing as more channels are also expected to sign up with Google. Aside from CBS, there’s NBC Universal and Walt Disney Co. believed to be added to ‘Unplugged’–the rumored name of the service. The idea of ‘Unplugged’ is to target those people who don’t want to subscribe to traditional cable subscription and pay for channels they don’t really watch. This web service is expected to be affordable, will be ad-free, and will also include YouTube Red. This low-cost web TV service by Google will rival other online video platforms like Hulu and Sling TV and other web streaming services available. This could be the YouTube premium we’ve been waiting for. Of course, it will require some free but we’re hoping not too expensive. YouTube is still the top video sharing website today and it will only continue to be the go-to platform with the upcoming ‘UnPlugged’ web TV service. VIA: WSJ Story Timeline ABC, CBS and NBC blocking website access on Google TV CBS brings streaming app to Android, shows available as soon as 24 hours after airing More apps now Chromecast-ready, FOX NOW, HGTV, and CBS All Access included YouTube Red officially available in Australia and New Zealand YouTube Kids now integrated with YouTube Red TAGS Android CBS Google video streaming Youtube Must Read Google Home Review: Feeling at home with Google Assistant This is the Huawei Mate 9 and its Porsche Design twin Huawei Fit hands-on: fitness tracker in smartwatch clothing Stay Connected 883,798FansLike 136,403FollowersFollow 102,861FollowersFollow 469,000FollowersFollow 59,238SubscribersSubscribe About Contact Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise © 2016 Android Community - Part of R3 Media LLC

Google this week introduced a new data archiving option for enterprises as part of a broader refresh of its Cloud Storage Services. The announcements, at Google's NEXT user event in London this week, included new data life cycle management tools, price cuts and the addition of several new partners to the Google storage ecosystem. Coldline, the name for the company's new storage option, is aimed at businesses looking to archive rarely used data—or cold data—but still require quick, low-latency access to it when needed. Google is touting it as perfect for archiving years' worth of big data or multimedia content. The option is priced at $0.007 per gigabyte of data to store per month and an additional 5 cents per GB to retrieve. The company claims the pricing makes Coldline the most economic option available to companies for storing datasets that are accessed less than once a year. Google is offering a Cloud Storage Transfer service and a Switch and Save promotion for companies interested in migrating their archived data to Coldline storage. Depending on the type of data that is migrated, enterprises can become eligible to store potentially up to 100 petabytes of data for free for several months, Google Product Manager Kirill Tropin said announcing the new offering on the Google Cloud Platform blog this week. Along with Coldline, Google also announced changes to its existing storage options. Enterprises signed up for the company's Standard storage option within a regional location have been converted to a new Cloud Storage Regional service, which offers essentially the same storage features and capabilities but at a 23 percent lower price point. Google has positioned the option as ideal for enterprises looking to maintain their compute and storage resources within the same region. Like all of Google's storage services, the Regional option offers enterprises millisecond access times to stored data. The service is priced at 2 cents per GB of data and comes with a 99.9 percent uptime guarantee. In addition, Google has converted all customers using its existing Standard storage option across multiple regions to a new Multi-Regional storage class. Priced at 2.6 cents per GB of data, the multiregional option is the costliest of the cloud storage options that Google announced this week and is aimed at organizations looking for near continuous data availability across regions. "Regional closely addresses similar use-cases in terms of features, but at a much lower cost," a Google spokeswoman said. "Multi-Regional is generally a new offering class for us. By allowing customers to host in two plus regions, it offers more flexibility for use-cases like disaster recovery than Standard previously did," she said. The fourth storage option that enterprises now have is Google Nearline and is meant as a storage option for infrequently accessed data such as long-tail content and data backups. The Nearline option starts at 1 cent per GB. Google this week also announced a beta version of a data management capability that it said will make it easier for enterprises to use and manage different cloud storage options for different business needs. A life cycle policy feature supports automatic transition of data from one storage type to another based on the age of the data and the frequency with which it is accessed. In addition to the storage refreshes, Google this week announced several new partners whose technologies it said have been integrated with Google Cloud Storage. Among them are Veritas, Fastly, Cloudberry Lab, Komprise and Stor Reduce. The partners deliver a range of capabilities. Cludberry's Backup technology for instance will let organizations do real-time or scheduled data backup, encryption and restoration in Google's cloud storage environment. Similarly, Stor Reduce offers what it calls inline deduplication software for moving petabytes of data to Coldline.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   Facebook Unveils Messenger Group Chat in Canada, Australia How the Internet Came of Age as a Campaign Tool in 2016 Election Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards YouTube Now Providing Support for High-Definition Video Cloud Native Computing Foundation Adds New Project, Grows Membership                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Featured Story: 10 Virtual Reality Apps to Get You Started with Google Cardboard Mobile VR News: Bringing the impossible worlds of our imagination to life. — Next Reality Hands-on: Google's Daydream View Feels Like a Hot & Stiff Pair of Sweatpants on Your Face Carib Guerra 3 weeks ago Hands-on: Google's Daydream View Feels Like a Hot & Stiff Pair of Sweatpants on Your Face While visiting the Made by Google pop-up shop in New York City this morning, I had a chance to try out the new Daydream View virtual reality headset. First impressions are important, and Google's new mobile VR product makes a good one. The headset is made of a soft fabric that most evokes a beloved old college sweater that's well worn but properly cared for. The demo only featured the Slate (darker gray) model, though customers will ultimately be able to choose from either Slate, Snow, and Crimson. By itself, the headset is lightweight and the added 5.93 oz of the Google Pixel XL, which runs the Daydream platform and provides the display, doesn't change much. Once the strap has been properly adjusted, the Daydream View fits snug on the wearer's head. My bespectacled coworker noted that it was the first VR headset she'd tried that was actually comfortable when worn over her glasses. The facepad—the inner mask-looking piece with eye holes and a nose dent—can be removed and is hand-washable. Stored within the front face of the headset is a simple remote controller used as the sole input method (aside from head tracking) for Daydream VR. The sleek oblong is small but stuffed with functionality in order to 'transform' as needed for whatever in-game uses developers come up with. Inside it packs a gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer for fine-tuned spacial tracking. The large circular concavity you see at the top of the controller is a touchpad and the whole face can be clicked like a mouse. Beneath the touchpad, are the "app" and "home" buttons. The volume controls are on the right side. During the limited demo I was able to experience the main menu and two games. The navigation is pretty straightforward. For the most part, your in-game experience will have a cursor that follows the controller's movements with a beam of light like a laser pointer. I found that the cursor would frequently move off center, forcing me to either list steadily to one side or recenter the entire experience with a jarring clip by holding down the "home" button. There were no headphones available at the demo, so the sound played through the Pixel XL's bottom (and only) speaker. That made it pretty much impossible to hear over the ambient noise and chatter of the event around me, and when I could hear it was obviously lopsided. Still, the level of immersion was downright impressive for a mobile VR experience. Limited, yes, but impressive nonetheless. The two games available were J.K. Rowling's "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," and a kid-centric collection of mini-games called "Wonderglade." While Fantastic Beasts was a superb showcase of Daydream's graphical and functional capabilities, Wonderglade made more use of the controller's in-game versatility. Image via PhoneArena One mini-game in Wonderglade was a digital version of those old wooden marble mazes where you have to adjust the board in order to navigate the marbles to their goal while avoiding holes. Here, the pitch and yaw of the controller affected the movement of the entire board. The Daydream View headset is comfortable. It is. But the material, soft and cozy and gray, imparts what can only be described as the feeling of having a pair of stiff sweatpants on your face. Plus, the phone heats up quick. So add to that image of stiff sweatpants a gently humming heating pad just inches away, and you'll have a close mental approximation of what it feels like to use the Daydream View for just a quick five minute virtual jaunt. After the demo, my face was all beaded up with sweat where the headset had been. [UPDATE: Responding to Tom's comment, I realized that I should note that the device used in the Daydream demo had been running for quite a while before I used it. Sweatface may not occur with moderate usage.] Don't Miss: Google's Daydream SDK Is Available Now—Here's How to Try It Out Overall, though, face sweat and brutal battery drainage really isn't such a high cost to pay for an honestly great VR experience—mobile or otherwise. The late-2016, two-punch combo of Google's Daydream and Playstation VR is going to make some serious headway in the march toward mass-adoption of VR and related technologies. For everything from its portability to its capability to its thoughtful design, I solidly vouch for the Daydream View. If you're on the fence and in New York City, go check it out.

How would you compare this to the Samsung Gear VR? As someone who wears glasses, and doesn't enjoy a sweaty face, the Gear VR has been quite good. I've been quite excited about Google's offering, especially with it being a fully integrated Android VR solution, rather than an add-on like the Occulus app, and it's nice to hear that it fits comfortably with glasses, but an overheated, sweaty face, means fogged glasses, and an unpleasant experience. That may very well be a deal breaker for me. Reply 1 Carib Guerra 3 weeks ago Hey Tom, thanks for reading! I don't wear glasses myself, so I can't speak to that side of things in comparing the two headsets. What I can say is that the Daydream View felt more like a finished product. The Gear VR has always felt like a bit of a stopgap to me, from the fit to the materials to the construction, it felt as though Samsung had said "good enough" and rushed it out to duly fill a hole in the market. The other thing I should note, and I probably should have said this in the post as well, is that the Pixel XL used in the demo yesterday had already been running for a while. Who knows how long. I was one of the first people in the popup, but I wasn't early in line for the Daydream demo. It's quite possible, even likely, that the device was running hot because of the extended use. TL;DR sweat-face may not result from normal usage. But if you plan on having that thing on your face for a couple of hours, bring a towel and sit in front of a big fan. Hope that helps!

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo News: The Made by Google Pop-Up Shop in NYC Is Like an Apple Store, but with Personality Carib Guerra 3 weeks ago The Made by Google Pop-Up Shop in NYC Is Like an Apple Store, but with Personality This morning, Google opened a pop-up showroom where anybody can visit to get a hands-on look at the new Made by Google hardware lineup. At 10 am the line at 96 Spring st, in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City, was growing but still manageable. Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks As we waited to be ushered in, Google representatives came by to offer us coffee drinks prepared by a pair of baristas in the Peddler Coffee cart parked on the curb. "Now that's latte art," said the guy in line next to me when he saw that the foam-topped drink that had just been delivered to him bore the new "G" logo (the baristas had a mocha-powder stencil). Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks He turned back to his friend and they continued weighing the pros and cons of the new Quite Blue Pixel phone. "I wish they'd made the front blue," said his line mate. The line proceeded in staggered waves for crowd control around the demos. It was a prudent move. The square footage of each demo area was no match for the number of feet pressing in. Skip the line and scroll through the gallery below to see what it was like. Images by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks The small rooms hosting demonstrations of "Ok Google" applications of the Google Home digital assistant were crowded out immediately, you can see one behind the "Google Home" pillar below: Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks On the other hand, nobody seemed very interested in the Google Photos showcase as presented by an unwieldy sphere of screens tucked into a claustrophobic alcove. Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks By far, the most popular item in the space was the Daydream View headset. Many guests ignored the rest of the exhibits and bee-lined over to get their first taste of Google's sophomore mobile VR experience as soon as they entered. The Daydream alcove was dressed up as the cartoonish digital forest that we first saw on stage at Google I/O 2016. Images by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks In person, the Daydream headset looks plush and snug. It's comfortable to wear (my coworker said it was the first VR headset she'd tried that felt cozy even over her glasses, true to a claim that Google made during their hardware keynote on October 4), but when I took it off after just a 5-10 minutes of use my face was beaded with sweat where the headset had sat. Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks The virtual reality experience inside the headset itself was impressive. For sure, it was the best mobile VR I've seen yet. The demo had two games to choose from, J.K. Rowling's "Fantastic Beasts (and Where to Find Them)", and "Wonder Glade" (a collection of simple games geared toward kids). Image via RoadToVR The graphics in Fantastic Beasts were top notch. The controls, a wand-shaped cursor that follows along as you move the physical Daydream remote, were easy to grasp. Unfortunately, the cursor frequently moved off center, forcing me to either list steadily to the left or recenter by holding down one of the buttons every few moments. I didn't have time to figure out if this was just me or some issue with the system. Overall I'd say the Daydream View is a huge win for mobile VR. I'm certainly looking forward to seeing what people build for the platform. Image by Carib Guerra/Android Hacks Nothing is available for purchase in the showroom, which is open daily from 10 AM to 8 PM through the end of 2016, but everyone is welcome to go try out Google's newest products. The company is also offering classes where you can reserve a time slot to learn about the Pixel phones from a certified Google guide in a small group of up to five people. According to the website there will be an event on Saturday, Oct. 29 where, "In celebration of National Cat Day, Made by Google will be hosting our furry celebrity friends—Nala and Luna Rose!"

Creative Commons Zero Ask people about Google’s relationship to open source, and many of them will point to Android and Chrome OS — both very successful operating systems and both based on Linux. Android, in particular, remains one of the biggest home runs in open source history. But, as Josh Simmons from Google’s Open Source Programs Office will tell you, Google also contributes a slew of useful open source tools and programs to the community each year. Now, Google has issued its very first “Open Source Report Card,” as announced by Simmons on the Google Open Source Blog. "We're sharing our first Open Source Report Card, highlighting our most popular projects, sharing a few statistics and detailing some of the projects we've released in 2016. We've open sourced over 20 million lines of code to date and you can find a listing of some of our best known project releases on our website," said Simmons. Open source projects emerge from all over Google, many of them produced through the company’s famous “80/20 directive” for employees, where they are advised to spend 80 percent of their time on Google-centric projects and 20 percent on their own creative projects. Google reports that its GitHub footprint includes more than 84 organizations and 3,499 repositories, 773 of which were created this year. Simmons has also rounded up Google’s most popular open source projects, as follows: Android -- A software stack for mobile devices that includes an operating system, middleware and key applications. Chromium - A project encompassing Chromium, the software behind Google Chrome, and Chromium OS, the software behind Google Chrome OSdc devices. Angular -- A web application framework for JavaScript and Dart focused on developer productivity, speed and testability. TensorFlow -- A library for numerical computation using data flow graphics with support for scalable machine learning across platforms from data centers to embedded devices. Go -- A statically typed and compiled programming language that is expressive, concise, clean and efficient. Kubernetes -- A system for automating deployment, operations and scaling of containerized applications now at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Polymer -- A lightweight library built on top of Web Components APIs for building encapsulated re-usable elements in web applications. Protobuf -- An extensible, language-neutral and platform-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data. Guava -- A set of Java core libraries that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, functional types, an in-memory cache, and APIs/utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, reflection, string processing and much more. Yeoman -- A robust and opinionated set of scaffolding tools including libraries and a workflow that can help developers quickly build beautiful and compelling web applications. Among recent open source contributions from Google, Kubernetes and TensorFlow are having particularly notable impact. Google’s Open Source Report Card also delves into the most popular languages that Googlers use. These are summarized in order, with open source strongly represented: JavaScript Java C/C++ Go Python TypeScript Dart PHP Objective-C C# The Open Source Report Card is not the only way to put metrics on Google’s open source activities. GitHub, in partnership with Google, has produced a new open dataset on Google BigQuery, a low-cost analytics data warehouse service in the cloud, so that anyone can get data-driven insights based on more than 2.8 million open source GitHub repositories. “Many things can be gleaned using the open source GitHub dataset on BigQuery,” Simmons notes, “like usage of tabs versus spaces and the most popular Go packages. What about how many times Googlers have committed to open source projects on GitHub? We can search for Google.com email addresses to get a baseline number of Googler commits.” “With this we learn that Googlers have made 142,527 commits to open source projects on GitHub since the start of the year. This dataset goes back to 2011 and we can tweak this query to find out that Googlers have made 719,012 commits since then. Again, this is just a baseline number as it doesn’t count commits made with other email addresses.” In recent months, Google also has open sourced other useful tools, many of them tested and hardened in-house.

Automakers and Google raised a litany of concerns about California’s proposal at a hearing in Sacramento on Wednesday. They expressed opposition to the state proposal to require compliance with guidelines that federal regulators issued last month, but made voluntary. They questioned why California would require a new autonomous vehicle data recorder and what data they would be required to test, and they objected to a proposal they said would force a 12-month delay between testing a vehicle and deploying it on public roads. Automakers also questioned whether police should be able to get any self-driving data within 24 hours without seeking a warrant or subpoena. California regulatory policy is important to automakers and technology companies because of its impact on operations in the state, and because the policies enacted in the most populous U.S. state often influence what other states and other countries do. The proposed requirement that manufacturers generate a year of driverless testing data before applying for an operating permit drew objections from General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG, Honda Motor Co., Ford Motor Co., and Google. The state’s approach “could greatly delay the benefits that self-driving vehicles can bring to safety and mobility for individuals,” said David Strickland, who heads the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets that includes Google, Ford, Lyft, Uber Technologies Inc. and Volvo Car Group. Brian Soublet, deputy director of the California DMV, said Wednesday the department wants concrete suggestions to help improve its proposal. Soublet said the department will be considering potential changes over the next several months but he did not give a timetable for finalizing the rules. “The goal is making sure that we can get this life-saving technology out on the streets,” Soublet said. California’s proposal would allow for the absence of a human driver and a steering wheel in advanced self-driving cars. In December, California had proposed to require licensed drivers and controls in self-driving vehicles. Ron Medford, director of safety for Google’s self-driving car project, said California’s proposal to require manufacturers to obtain local approval is “unworkable.” The rule could prevent manufacturers from testing a vehicle that can travel from one area to another. Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog urged California to prohibit autonomous vehicles without a human driver until federal regulators enact enforceable standards. (Reporting by Shepardson.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Android Pay stopped working on phones with unlocked bootloaders By R Padla - October 20, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Android Pay is one of the widely used mobile payment services today. It rivals Samsung Pay and Apple Pay but it has a bigger advantage because there are more Android devices combined all over the world compared to pure Samsung phones and iPhones. For those people who like to unlock their devices, know that Google is making changes by applying the SafetyNet system. This means if you use unlocked bootloaders and Android Pay, Google will not be able to verify your account. Google is preventing modifications that can be dangerous to devices that’s why it’s using SafetyNet to stop them. No official announcement from Google but Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P users have been complaining, saying a message prompt has appeared when trying to use Android Pay. A Redditor known as PhantomGamers said he received a “We could not verify your software” message. His device was running an unlocked bootloader. The same thing happened to another user who was running CyanogenMod 13 on a new OnePlus 3. One Nexus 6P user even received a longer note: “Android pay can’t be used on this device. Google isn’t able to confirm that your device or the software on it is is Android compatible. You many need to unroot your device.” This can be frustrating for some Android Pay users but it seems to be a reminder from Google for you to be wary of whatever modifications you are doing on your phone. If you happen to run on an unlocked bootloader and are a regular Android Pay user, you may encounter this error from now on. Make sure you bring cash or your credit card with you always when going out because your Android phone may fail you.

Skip to content INFORMATION NIGERIA Nigeria's No.1 Information Portal Menu Home Trending Metro Entertainment Music Lifestyle Sports World Odd News Education Jobs When Voters Google ‘Donald Trump Iraq’: Here’s What They Found Google saw a surge in searches of the term “Donald Trump Iraq” during the third and final presidential debate yesterday, when Donald Trump once again denied that he supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003. His rival in the debate, Hillary Clinton wanted everyone to know that’s not the case and begged voters to Google ‘Donald Trump Iraq’ for fact-checking…and they listened. “Google it. You’ll see dozens of sources verifying that he supported the invasion of Iraq, and you can hear the audio of him saying it, the Democratic nominee said. The audio the former Secretary of State was referring to is from a 2002 interview Trump did with Howard Stern, six months before the Iraq invasion. When the radio show host asked Donald if he was in favor of the Iraq war, he responded, “Yeah, I guess so.

By Jack Wallen | October 20, 2016, 11:52 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Google Every so often you might find Google Drive on Android giving you fits. You want to work on a document saved to your Google Cloud, or a document saved to work on locally and it won't open. When those docs won't download or open, productivity can grind to a halt. You check your network connection, and it's good to go. You reboot your device, and the problem persists. What is going on? Why won't Google Drive behave? The problem lies in the Google Drive cache (that's right...cache strikes again). There are many times and various instances where a system, service, or app cache can cause a host of problems, and Google Drive is not immune. In the end, you just need the app to function so you can get back to work. With that said, let's solve this problem. SEE: Report: More than half of IT professionals think the cloud makes their jobs harder Clearing the Google Drive cache You might think clearing the entire app cache would solve this problem, but it doesn't always; besides, there may be instances when you don't want to clear the cache for all of your apps. Here's how to clear just the Google Drive cache. 1. Open the Google Drive app and then tap the menu button in the top left corner (three vertical bars). 2. When the sidebar opens (Figure A), scroll down and tap Settings. Figure A Image: Jack Wallen The Google Drive sidebar open on a OnePlus 3. 3. From within the Settings window, scroll down until you see Clear Cache (Figure B). Tap that button and then, when prompted, tap OK to remove all cached documents from within Google Drive. Figure B Image: Jack Wallen Clearing the cache on Google Drive. You should be able to, once again, work with Google Drive. You'll also see that all of your offline documents are still listed. As soon as you clear the cache, those offline documents will be automatically re-downloaded and made available to you. Clearing the Google Docs cache On the off chance that clearing the Google Drive cache doesn't resolve the issue, you might have to clear the cache on Google Docs as well. To do this, follow these steps. Open Google Docs on your mobile device. Tap the menu button in the upper left corner (three horizontal bars). Tap Settings. Scroll down and tap Clear Cache. When prompted, tap OK. Now go back to the document that won't open and try again. At this point, the file should be fine. It will happen When you're using the cloud (and who isn't?), you know errors are going to occur. In the case of Google Drive/Docs, the errors are rare, but when they happen, they can strike at the absolute worst times. Fortunately, the solution for solving the issue of docs not opening is quite simple: clear your cache, and all is right in the world. If things go wrong, you always have a backup via the web version of Google Drive. To be safe, make sure you employ a tool/service like Insync to keep a local copy of Google Drive on your desktop.

Kodak first introduced its Ektra camera to the masses in 1941. The new Ektra smartphone features several nods to past incarnations, complete with a textured finish and leather accessories for carrying the device. In addition, the device nods to its predecessors via a Super-8 app, which allows users to add touches that are akin to finishes seen on Super-8 videos of yesteryear. More on this... Google takes aim at Apple and Samsung with Pixel phones With Android on top of the world, Google is already working on a mysterious new OS Google’s vision for VR: Bringing high-end VR to the masses However, the inner workings of the device are decidedly modern. A HELIO X20 Decacore processor runs Android Marshmallow software. The device’s 21-megapixel camera sensor has f2.0 aperture and a 13-megapixel front-facing camera with phase detection autofocus and f2.2 aperture. Ektra’s camera app is controlled by a SLR-style scene selection dial, allowing users to adjust settings including landscape, sport, and night-time. The camera also has a smart auto mode, which auto-selects the condition. Kodak added that advanced users can put the Manual mode through its paces by adjusting exposure, ISO, focus, white balance and shutter speed. In a press release on Kodak’s website, Chief Executive Jeff Clarke said, “the launch of the KODAK Smartphone today demonstrates our ongoing commitment to bringing the latest advances in photography to consumers. [The EKTRA Smartphone] opens up a world of creative opportunities to all who care about photography.” The device will be available in Europe and retails for around $550, according to Kodak.

Whether it’s about billboards spread across major cities, videos or crazy print ads, the Mountain View firm is going all in. And so here we are, on launch day, with three just-released videos dedicated to the Phone by Google; but this time with a touch of YouTube celebrities… Unlike last time, where Google seemed to focus entirely on a “human” aspect (by essentially remaining radio silent about specs or features whatsoever), the three new clips are actually minute-long videos that focus entirely on one of the phone’s capabilities. We have one for the Assistant, one for the camera, and then a last one for Duo. Singer, actor, dancer, director, choreographer, and YouTuber Todrick Hall is up first, in its Assistant-driven journey towards designing and creating a new jacket with a hand from Google’s digital helper. The “Perfect Piece” sees Hall asking the assistant about photos, places nearby, as well as a series of everyday questions it hasn’t much trouble figuring out — all with a touch of humor. Alisha Marie’s glamping trip follows; and what best occasion to take advantage of the Pixel’s stunning 12MP shooter? The ad focuses on things such as the double-twist for selfie mode, the panorama feature, HDR+, 4K recording, EIS, low light capabilities, Lens Blur and the like. Of course, the “unlimited storage at full resolution” makes its appearance, too — and considering how great that is, I’d say it’s definitely a good thing to put in there. Connor Franta’s puppies bonanza closes the ad trifecta, with not much to show as Duo’s simplicity speaks for itself. Indeed, the Knock Knock feature is highlighted — as well as put in direct comparison with iOS’ rather dull notification — but it’s Franta’s relative popularity and the newborn dogs that somehow manage to lift the overall tone (whether you think it’s cringeworthy or not).

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. An article in Search Engine Land examines the way search engine optimization has changed over the past few years. In spite of rumors that SEO is dead, this columnist believes it has simply evolved. He points out that the way people approach SEO these days is very different and that the sort of cookie-cutter approach that used to work is now rarely successful in helping to push a site to the top of Google. What is different about SEO is that there is no real formula. While someone skilled can put best practices into use, increasing the likelihood of a good outcome, there are no guarantees. Of course, this has always been true and SEO practitioners who promise clients the Earth really should never have been trusted. The change to how SEO can affect a website’s ranking began back in 2011 with the introduction of Google Panda. Although in some ways it was easy to understand, in other ways the effects were very subtle. In order to introduce Panda, Google had collated ratings from humans on how they perceived the quality of the website, based on a set of questions. Machine learning algorithms were then applied to extend these opinions, leading to the development of Panda. In 2013 Google introduced Hummingbird, which took artificial intelligence to another level. For this introduction, the core search algorithm had undergone a major rewrite. Initially it appeared as if there was no real impact, but apparently, Hummingbird was able to affect 90% of all searches compared to Panda affecting just 12%. But the reason for this perhaps lies in the growing ability to be able to talk to machines using everyday language. This means the search engines like Google have to understand the intent behind the query, not merely the words. Last year Google released RankBrain, a machine particularly useful for long-tail queries and which introduces the concept of semantic search. Amazingly, 15% of search queries are completely new to Google. Thanks to semantic search, Google can understand an article more easily, which is shown when an article ranks for keywords that aren’t found anywhere in the article or in the anchor text. A recent study looked at 1 million Google search results and found title tag correlation, the connection between a particular keyword in the title tag and ranking for the search for that keyword is much smaller than expected. Whereas it used to be important to have an exact matching keyword or something close to it, now there isn’t such a need to be explicit with the keyword being targeted, thanks to Google gaining a better understanding of the context of the article. This may be why longer content is becoming preferable as it is more able to fully describe the topic and is more relevant. To read the complete article, please click here.

Comments Jeff says: October 25, 2016 at 8:14 pm SEO is always in a constant state of change. Ways to exploit the algorithm are found and then Google eventually closes the loopholes. It’s a cat and mouse game. Mohan raj says: October 21, 2016 at 5:09 pm From my knowledge people keep on saying SEO is dead from 2010 onwards. But SEO is going great , crafting perfect result pages for white hat sites. In future, it is going to be AI which gives users a perfect results. What do you say ?

Politics 1 0 0 October 20, 2016 ‘I Opposed Going In’: Trump Says Clinton Tells Americans To Google ‘Donald Trump Iraq’ What Did They Find? Tito Ojo-Medubi During Wednesday’s presidential debate, Donald Trump said he never supported the invasion of Iraq and Hillary Clinton told Americans to Google “Donald Trump Iraq.” Hillary Clinton revealed that Donald Trump continued to give the impression that he never supported the Iraqi war to score political points. According to the New York Times, Hillary Clinton told voters to fact-check the assertion that he supported the invasion right from the beginning by going to Google. “I just want everybody to go Google it. Google, ‘Donald Trump Iraq.’ And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq. And you will hear the audio of him saying it.” You don’t have to Google “Donald Trump – Iraq,” just click this https://t.co/xDHGpSWYBw — BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) October 20, 2016 After her comments, online searches spiked according to data from Google Trends. “Donald Trump Iraq” was a phrase searched more significantly than any other topic discussed by the two political rivals. This is not the first time that the invasion of Iraq would pose to be a contentious topic during the presidential debates. In the first debate in September, Trump revealed that he vehemently opposed the war. In the second debate, which was held in October, Hillary Clinton pointed out that the businessman-turned-politician had supported the war even before it began. Clinton asked debate viewers to Google "Donald Trump Iraq" last night. It worked: off the chart search trend compared to other hot topics. pic.twitter.com/ysJ6puJaZ1 — Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) October 20, 2016 The 68-year-old Democratic Party hopeful has pointed out several times that it is on record that Donald Trump supported the war. Hillary Clinton is referring to a 2002 interview Trump did with Howard Stern, six months before American forces launched a military offensive against Iraq. The radio show host had asked Trump if he was in support of the war and the New York businessman countered “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.” However, the 70-year-old has consistently denied that he supported the war since the debates started. “I opposed going in. And I did oppose it, despite the media saying no, yes, no. I opposed going in.” [Image by Mark Ralston/AP Images] Donald Trump has a confusing and lengthy history over his stance over the Iraq war. In one of his campaign rallies, he addressed his stance against the war referencing an August, 2004, Esquire article where he objected the war. In the interview, Trump had called the war a mess that was handled badly. “Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we’re in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box — and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? Two minutes after we leave, there’s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest most vicious guy will take over.” The editor of Esquire has since come out to say that Trump was misrepresenting the facts. [Image by Patrick Semansky/AP Images] In November 2004, Donald Trump, while on CNN’s Larry King Live, had reiterated that going into Iraq was a bad decision. Donald Trump has referenced these two periods as proof that he never, at any point, showed support for the Iraqi war, accusing the media of being dishonest and spinning a web of lies. Trump said the Howard Stern statement was the first time someone had asked him about the Iraq situation. He said he showed an initial support of the war because he did not have all the facts. However, when he had a stronger grasp of the issues, he gave subsequent statements why it was not right for America to invade the oil-rich nation. The 70-year-old said if he had been in congress at the advent of the invasion, he would have taken a stronger stand by casting a vote of opposition. Trump said he was a private citizen who had no access to briefings or covert intelligence files like his political rival, Hillary Clinton, and admitted that he backtracked on his initial stance when he got more information about the war.

Google is looking to offer a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month, according to media executives who have heard the pitch.” “Apple Inc. has explored putting together its own discounted online TV bundle, but ran into issues securing media rights on the terms it wanted,” Flint and Ramachandran report. “Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network. 21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Well, at least somebody is capable of getting ink. It’s quite possible that without Steve Jobs’ help, Eddy Cue couldn’t get ink in a stationery store. Just kidding (sort of)! But, boy this is taking eons to accomplish, isn’t it? — MacDailyNews, November 5, 2015 As we wrote last December: “It’s 2015. This should’ve happened already. At this rate, America will back on the moon before Eddy Cue gets the contracts inked. So, before we’re dead, m’kay?” Apple’s Internet TV service, if it ever happens, would have to have ESPN. It will also likely require the “Big Four” networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) – although it could launch with three out of four and eventually hammer out a deal with whichever one is being the most reticent. That said, at this late date, Apple might as well wait until they have a full dance card. What else would you consider to be must-haves? Beyond the Big Four, if you go by primetime ratings (total viewers), the top 20 U.S. cable networks are: 1. ESPN 2. Fox News Channel 2. USA 3. TBS 4. Disney 5. Discovery Channel 6. History Channel 7. TNT 8. HGTV 9. Nickelodeon 10. AMC 11. Adult Swim 12. FX 13. Cartoon Network 14. Food Channel 15. Lifetime 16. ABC Family 17. Syfy 18. TLC 19. Hallmark 20.

Nothing to do with cost, Eddie or any other deficiency. Alphabet on the other hand… MacObserver Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:05 pm · Reply $ would solve that impasse. Apple is being cheap. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:13 pm · Reply This is a problem Apple is increasingly facing and fact is for all its rightful moral stance on the matter, too few are equally concerned to not put them at an increasingly important disadvantage. This I something they just have to solve and soon or they won’t be able to compete in many areas from Siri to web and card services. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:08 pm · Reply If this happens it will be one big embarrassment for Apple. Sadly the days when others were desperate to be part of Apple led strategies seems long gone. Indeed should this take off then it will be more than embarrassment, it will lead to the return of the Apple demise clock in many quarters as others are seen to be able to take Apple’s ideas and do better at getting them over the line, the ultimate in humiliation. Some re invigoration is sorely needed, let’s hope there is at least some sign of that at the Mac event, though not holding my breath. yojimbo007 Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 3:11 pm · Reply this is a total shame… unless Apple has something going on behind the closed doors too … DavGreg Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 6:15 pm · Reply A La Carte – not a bundle. CBS is of no importance. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 2:47 am · Reply The concept of “a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month” is going to go over like a lead balloon. After the FAIL of these disparate for-charge services, we’re going to see a shakeup in the industry. It’s going to be very interesting to watch. The old guard of the media oligarchy are going to be reaching for their nitroglycerin pills. IOW: Stormy seas ahead.

At this point, all we can do is nitpick, zooming into 100% crops and analyzing every last Pixel. By now we’ve all heard Google’s claims that the camera in their new line of Pixel smartphones isn’t just one of the best smartphone cameras on the market — it’s the king of them all. Well, that’s if DxOMark’s review is to be believed, with the Google Pixel receiving high-marks in just about every area, narrowly beating out even the Samsung Galaxy S7 with its camera prowess. So what’s so special about the Pixel? Well, on camera hardware is on part with most other offerings. The Pixel is equipped with a 12.3MP Sony IMX378 image sensor that features 1.55um pixels and an f/2.0 lens to help capture more light. There aren’t too many devices using this same hardware, but the guys at XDA had a great write up of everything the sensor is technically capable of. But it’s in the software and Google’s finely tuned image processing where the Pixel truly shines. How does HDR+ work? We know, most phones these days feature some type of HDR mode in their camera app (with varying results). Even last year’s Nexus devices featured HDR+, but nobody is doing it the way Google does on the Pixel. First off, HDR+ is now instant. There’s no delay when capturing photos like we saw on previous Nexus devices. That’s because the Pixel’s HDR+ is leveraging the Snapdragon 821’s new Hexagon digital signal processor processor. HDR+ Off, Auto, On This allows the camera to begin capturing RAW photos in the background as soon as the camera app is opened. These images are all underexposed and once combined (after the shutter button is pressed), produces a much sharper, less noisy shot with dramatically more detail in highlights that would normally be blown out in other smartphone cameras. Unfortunately, this doesn’t do much for lightening up shadows (something the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 excel at with their respective HDR methods), but it is what it is. Because the Pixel’s camera doesn’t have to take a single loooong exposure like on other devices, it’s a big reason why Google didn’t feel the need to include OIS on the Pixel — they don’t need it. As for video, we’ll get to that later… HDR+ Off, Auto, On That’s not to say the images the Pixel captures are perfect. There’s a fair amount of noise. A great deal more than what you normally see on competing devices and depending on who you ask, this could be off-putting. This was actually a conscious move by Google to preserve finer details in photos — a stark contrast to the noise filtering you see on most smartphones these days, resulting in a watercolor-like effect that looks artificial. With the Pixel, you’ll see concrete for what it is, couch fibers, hair, pimples — every detail and imperfection. Sure it’s a little more noisy, but it’s a worthwhile trade-off if you ask us. Although we’d give the Pixel the slight edge in outdoor daytime shots, it’s during moderate to low light situations where the phone absolutely blows past the competition. Simply put, no phone out there can match this level of image quality. We’re not talking about taking photos in pitch darkness, but indoors or restaurant lighting where devices like the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7 struggle. Not only do they lose much of their detail, photos are mostly washed out at higher ISOs, practically monochrome in some instances. The Pixel’s HDR+ on the other hand, pulls much richer colors in low light — all without blowing out highlights, a pitfall of other cameras who use slower shutter speeds to capture more light. In almost ever instance we could test, the difference was like night and day. The Pixel’s HDR+ is a force to be reckoned. I will say I think I still prefer the (slower) method on previous Nexus devices, but it’s really hard to compete with zero shutter lag. For more on how the Pixel stacks up against the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, check out our comparison post here. The downside to using HDR+ Auto on the Pixel? There really is none — so leave it on 24/7. My only issue with HDR+ Auto/On My only complaint is the way Google named the two HDR+ shooting modes. On most devices, “HDR Auto” means the phone decides when is the best time to use HDR (like when there’s a lot of really dark and bright areas in a shot). Sometimes it engages, sometimes it doesn’t. This is much different on the Pixel where HDR+ Auto means HDR+ will always be used. For every shot. The only time it’s not used is when you fire off too many shots and the phone’s buffer can’t keep up. For instance, taking 5 shots in rapid succession will cause HDR+ to skip the 6th and subsequent shots unless you give it a quick second to finish buffering. I also thought that HDR+ Auto would occasionally trigger that extreme HDR we see with HDR+ On, but it doesn’t. So once again, having HDR+ Auto enabled means it will always be used. HDR+ On, aka Super HDR+ When it comes to the HDR+ On, you may be thinking that (like with every other camera out there) it simply means HDR+ will be used for every shot. But if that’s already what HDR+ Auto does — what the heck is the difference? Well, think of HDR+ On as a more extreme version of HDR+ Auto. Like Super HDR+ if you will. Where as HDR+ Auto gently brings down highlights, HDR+ On is much more aggressive. It’s closer to real HDR photographs you see with DSLRs which means it often times comes off as looking artificial. It doesn’t do much to bring out shadows, but sometimes you’ll find a teensy bit more detail in dark areas. There’s decent shutter lag too, just like with HDR+ on older Nexuses. Shots take about 1 second to fully capture a photo. It’s definitely not for everyone and unlike previous Nexus devices — where HDR+ On was perfect for low lighting conditions — there’s significant noise using HDR+ On in low light (much more than HDR+ Auto). But if you’re taking a picture of a building at night and want to get all the brightly lit details inside, it can be perfect for that. Front facing camera using HDR+ Off, Auto, On The front facing camera also reaps the benefits of the Pixel’s amazing HDR+ modes. There’s a crazy amount of color detail (almost to a fault), with selfies that are always perfectly exposed, even in low light. On every other smartphone, I never understood how people could willingly choose to use a sh*tty front facing camera to capture a special moment but on the Pixel, there’s very little sacrifice. Simply put: thanks to HDR+, this is the best front facing camera around, hands down. Video so stable, it’s like magic Like most other high-end devices these days, the Pixel is capable of shooting 4K UHD video. The difference is Google is using software tricks to keep the video steady — not OIS. You may think this wouldn’t be as nice a hardware solution, seeing as how traditional EIS zooms in on a video, sacrificing image clarity in an effort to smooth out shakes and jitters. The Pixel on the other hand uses a combination of the phone’s hardware (gyroscope) and software to help with the rolling shutter and smooth out video. There’s very little “jello” side-effect you see in other EIS solutions. While it works damn near perfect in outdoor daytime situations, it’s all but nullified in low light where the software has a difficult time figuring out what’s going on to keep video stabilized. See our results below. Video with the front facing camera caps out at 1080p and although the quality is there, doesn’t seem to benefit from the same EIS as the rear camera. One of my favorite features with video capture is the option to pause in the middle of video, making it perfect for capturing an event, birthday, or wedding, without having to worry about splicing together clips after the fact. There’s also the ability to snap “photos” while recording video, but it’s mostly just a screen cap of the video being recorded. All in all, video on the Pixel looks great. It’s clean, stable, and one of the best reasons to own the phone (providing you don’t shoot too much footage after dark). My biggest gripe with video on the Pixel has been audio quality, which is still quite average. I have yet to test the audio in a concert setting, but will report back with my findings when I do. Software Although the Pixel’s camera software isn’t anywhere near as robust as you’d find on devices like the Galaxy S7 or LG V20, it’s still a big upgrade from previous generation Nexuses. There’s no pro mode to fine tune every camera setting, but Google did update the app by adding the ability to adjust white balance (presets) and introducing the sometimes handy focus/exposure lock. AF/AE is activated by long pressing anywhere in the view finder and once engaged, allows you to manually adjust the exposure by sliding your finger up or down. It doesn’t give you a full range of exposure control, only 2 stops from where you initially locked it. Other available shooting modes include: Slow Motion – 240fps at 720p, or 120fps at 1080p Panorama – There are 4 options for shooting a panorama: Horizontal, vertical, big, or fisheye Photo Sphere – Capture a full, 360-degree image Lens Blur – Create a shallow depth of field effect by blurring out the background of an object The software is really nothing to write home about. It’s simple and intuitive and there are enough “fun” features to easily give the Pixel camera a leg up on the iPhone. The few manual controls are a nice addition, but we’re hoping this is just the beginning of what Google is planning for their camera app. The only thing missing — at least for me — was an official Android alternative to Live Photos. Perhaps I’m alone in this, but Live Photos are easily one of my favorite camera features from the iPhone and if there was ever going to be a proper Android alternative, the Pixel would do it. I mean, it’s already shooting off a million photos in the background, just give us the option to turn those into Live Photos. Performance This is where we’ll talk briefly about the performance of the camera app. Launch times are extremely quick. Tap on the camera app and it launches in almost no time flat. Google also added a handy shortcut where double tapping the power button can wake the phone and launch directly into the app. Fire too quick, and HDR+ Auto might not activate (remember, it takes about a second for the phone to buffer the background photos it needs for HDR+). When it comes to auto focus, the Pixel uses a combination of phase detection and laser auto focus for mostly stellar results. It’s quick and accurate in most settings, although nowhere near in the same ballpark as the Galaxy S7’s Dual Pixel auto focus. We did find that it can, at times, be somewhat inconsistent and you still get that hunting (focusing in/out) when it attempt to lock onto something. For when it does act up, tap to focus always comes in handy, although it forces the camera app to expose for whatever you just tapped. The Pixel can also fire off bursts of photos by holding the shutter button, choosing the photo it feels is the “best” of the bunch (along with 7 runner ups). It’s called “Smartburst” and although you wont get the HDR+ benefits by shooting this way, it could be helpful when attempting to capture a fast moving subject. Smartburst can also creation GIFs from these bursts, or allow you to create a collage, which is a nice touch. Beware the flare Examples of the weird flaring I occasionally see pop up in some of my shots Although I didn’t see this mentioned in most of the early reviews, I did notice some pretty apparent lens flares. It’s not all of the time, only whenever light — be it direct sunlight, light from a window, or even a ceiling light — would hit the camera the right way. The crazy part is not only the rear camera that suffers from this, it also popped up when using the front facing camera as well. Not a huge deal-breaker by any means, but something worth mentioning. ***** Mobile photography is always inconsistent at best and there’s no single smartphone camera that excels in every area. Whereas most manufacturers are hellbent on tackling the issue with bigger and badder hardware (higher megapickles, dual-cameras, OIS or GTFO), Google is focusing on computational photography. They’re not just working harder, they’re working smarter. For the first time it feels like Google is finally taking mobile photography seriously. While individual tastes may differ, there’s really no denying the results. From brightly lit environments, to low light, to video stabilization and the like, it’s going to be black magic as far as most people are concerned. That’s how good the Pixel camera is. Yes, there are plenty of great options out there when shopping around for a great smartphone camera (even mid-range-ish $400 devices), but we can safely say — without a shadow of a doubt — the Pixel safely sits at the top of that list. We’re sure to see further advancements in this space and although it’s not by a huge margin, Google can finally say that for a brief moment in time, they were the best. Good job, Google.

Starting today, both products are available for pre-order. Currently, if you head on over to the Google Store, you will be able to add a Daydream View to your cart and order it. Going for $79, Google states that it will ship out the VR headset to you in two to three weeks. For now, only the Slate color is available for purchase. If you don’t feel like picking it up from Google, Verizon is also accepting Daydream View pre-orders here. It still costs $79 for the VR headset but the wireless carrier does state that it will ship by November 16. Just remember that if you’ve already pre-ordered the Pixel or Pixel XL from either Google or Verizon, you should receive a promotional code for a free Daydream View several weeks after your phone ships. The Chromecast Ultra is also available for pre-order on the Google Store for $69. Much like the Chromecasts of previous years, the Ultra plugs into an HDMI port in the back of your television and allows you to cast content onto the screen with your phone, tablet, or computer as the remote. The Ultra brings with it the ability to stream 4K and HDR content plus it is able to plug into Ethernet with no additional accessories required. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

This isn’t the first version of Google’s voice search technology, but it is the friendliest. Apple kicked off this trend with Siri on the iPhone 4s. Siri started with a lot of personality and has slowly gained more useful features. Google took a different path. They started with a lot of great features and very little personality. Now, they are going for both. Google Assistant is basically an evolved version of Google Now. It does a lot of the same stuff, but with a different pizazz. The personality is more important than some people might think. Siri received a ton of attention at the beginning because of the jokes and witty responses. Google’s voice search was infinitely more useful in everyday life, but it didn’t receive nearly as much publicity. So how does Assistant compare with Siri now? Let’s take a look. Here is the full list of commands we used in the video above. Call my wife Send a text to Holly Send a tweet remind me to mow the lawn tomorrow Show me fast food nearby How far is it to Ford Field Open Chrome Go to Phandroid.com Who won the Nobel prize last year who won the NBA playoffs what time is the Cubs game Get me an Uber What’s the square root of 64 How old is John Oliver Where was he born Show me news about Rogue One When does it come out? What am I doing on Friday Show me photos of lake Michigan What movies are playing nearby What’s the weather like in Cleveland, OH My favorite color is blue What’s my favorite color Let’s play a game Tell me a joke Who has the best memory? Assistant and Siri both display information in a conversational format. It’s meant to feel like you’re talking to a real person. A real person can remember things that you previously asked about. A real person can also remember things about you. A few of the questions above have follow-up questions. Assistant and Siri both handled the first one well. I asked “how old is John Oliver” and then “where was he born?” Both recognized that the second question was still about Oliver. Next, I asked for “news about Rogue One” and then “when is it coming out?” Assistant understood that I was still talking about Rogue One and told me the release date. Siri asked me to pick a movie. The next test comes with asking for information to be remembered for later. Both allow you to say things like “My wife is _____” and it will be remembered when you say “call my wife.” But what about other stuff? Assistant will remember anything you tell it. I said “my favorite color is blue” and Assistant was able to repeat that when I asked, “what is my favorite color?” Siri got sassy and said, “I can’t read minds.” Where are the apps? One of Siri’s new tricks in iOS 10 is greater integration with apps. This is something that demoed on Google Assistant at I/O, but it’s not available yet. The first app-related command was about composing a tweet. I asked both to “send a tweet.” Google Assistant pulled up some random web article about Twitter. Siri asked, “what would you like to say?” I could then recite my tweet, have it read back, and send it, all without touching the phone. Next, I asked for an Uber. Assistant shared the Uber sign-up page web result. Siri said, “I don’t see an app for that.” If I had the Uber app installed, it would have ordered a ride for me. Assistant will eventually be able to do more with apps, but right now Siri is winning this category. Who’s more fun now? I started this article by saying Siri had more personality at launch. However, now I would argue that Google has surpassed Apple in this category as well. Assistant has a huge library of Easter eggs and silly responses. It can tell jokes, play games, and even recite poetry. If you know the secret command, you can even play a silly game show. When I asked Siri to play a game it said: “that is beyond my abilities.” I asked for a joke and Siri said: “nope…can’t think of one.” Hilarious. Siri has lost some of its sense of humor over the years. Who reigns supreme? There are a lot of things that these two virtual assistants do well, but they both have weaknesses. Google Assistant is better at remembering information and allowing you to reference things from earlier in the conversation. Siri is better at working with other apps on your phones. Assistant also seems to be capable of more fun if that’s important to you. The question is, which assistant is the best right now? Both will continue to get better. Google Assistant will get new features when Google Home is released and Siri improves with every release of iOS.

It was at its event on October 4th that the company launched the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. It also launched a handful of other products at the event, such as the 4K-ready Chromecast Ultra as well as the Daydream View VR headset. Both the streaming media player and headset are now available for purchase from the Google Store. Chromecast Ultra is essentially the same dongle as the existing Chromecast, the only major feature it offers is support for 4K streaming. You don’t need that feature if you don’t have a 4K TV. It costs $69 and the Google Store mentions that orders placed now will be shipped within 2-3 weeks. The Daydream View VR headset is based on the Daydream platform that Google unveiled earlier this year. The Pixel and Pixel XL are currently the only major smartphones that work with this headset but other OEM partners will be launching their Daydream-compatible handsets by next year. Even though Google said at the event that the headset is going to be available in a variety of colors, currently it can only be ordered in slate gray from the Google Store. Daydream View costs $79 and it will also ship within 2-3 weeks after the order is placed. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about Daydream View, Google, pixel and pixel xl.

Google is looking to offer a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month, according to media executives who have heard the pitch.” “Apple Inc. has explored putting together its own discounted online TV bundle, but ran into issues securing media rights on the terms it wanted,” Flint and Ramachandran report. “Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network. 21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Well, at least somebody is capable of getting ink. It’s quite possible that without Steve Jobs’ help, Eddy Cue couldn’t get ink in a stationery store. Just kidding (sort of)! But, boy this is taking eons to accomplish, isn’t it? — MacDailyNews, November 5, 2015 As we wrote last December: “It’s 2015. This should’ve happened already. At this rate, America will back on the moon before Eddy Cue gets the contracts inked. So, before we’re dead, m’kay?” Apple’s Internet TV service, if it ever happens, would have to have ESPN. It will also likely require the “Big Four” networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) – although it could launch with three out of four and eventually hammer out a deal with whichever one is being the most reticent. That said, at this late date, Apple might as well wait until they have a full dance card. What else would you consider to be must-haves? Beyond the Big Four, if you go by primetime ratings (total viewers), the top 20 U.S. cable networks are: 1. ESPN 2. Fox News Channel 2. USA 3. TBS 4. Disney 5. Discovery Channel 6. History Channel 7. TNT 8. HGTV 9. Nickelodeon 10. AMC 11. Adult Swim 12. FX 13. Cartoon Network 14. Food Channel 15. Lifetime 16. ABC Family 17. Syfy 18. TLC 19. Hallmark 20.

Nothing to do with cost, Eddie or any other deficiency. Alphabet on the other hand… MacObserver Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:05 pm · Reply $ would solve that impasse. Apple is being cheap. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:13 pm · Reply This is a problem Apple is increasingly facing and fact is for all its rightful moral stance on the matter, too few are equally concerned to not put them at an increasingly important disadvantage. This I something they just have to solve and soon or they won’t be able to compete in many areas from Siri to web and card services. spyintheskyuk Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 2:08 pm · Reply If this happens it will be one big embarrassment for Apple. Sadly the days when others were desperate to be part of Apple led strategies seems long gone. Indeed should this take off then it will be more than embarrassment, it will lead to the return of the Apple demise clock in many quarters as others are seen to be able to take Apple’s ideas and do better at getting them over the line, the ultimate in humiliation. Some re invigoration is sorely needed, let’s hope there is at least some sign of that at the Mac event, though not holding my breath. yojimbo007 Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 3:11 pm · Reply this is a total shame… unless Apple has something going on behind the closed doors too … DavGreg Thursday, October 20, 2016 - 6:15 pm · Reply A La Carte – not a bundle. CBS is of no importance. Derek Currie Friday, October 21, 2016 - 2:47 am · Reply The concept of “a ‘skinny’ bundle of live TV channels with a price in the range of $25 to $40 a month” is going to go over like a lead balloon. After the FAIL of these disparate for-charge services, we’re going to see a shakeup in the industry. It’s going to be very interesting to watch. The old guard of the media oligarchy are going to be reaching for their nitroglycerin pills. IOW: Stormy seas ahead.

Google recently announced the new Coldline cloud storage offering and lowered pricing for all of its storage tiers. However, challenges remain that hold Google back from being a cloud storage powerhouse. By Conner Forrest | October 20, 2016, 9:03 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/peangdao Google recently dropped pricing on all of its cloud storage tiers and announced a new cold storage option called Coldline. The news is sure to keep the cloud price wars going, but it may not be enough to win enterprises over to Google storage. The new Coldline tier is specifically for rarely-accessed data and archival storage. It costs $0.007 per GB, per month, and it also carries an access fee of five cents. If desired, Google also offers a fast access option that will bring you millisecond access. The Google Coldline tier costs the same amount as Amazon's Glacier storage. Google's Multi-Regional storage tier, which positions itself as a good option for video, multimedia, and business continuity, now costs $0.026 per GB, per month. It offers multiple geographic storage regions in the US, the EU, and Asia to improve redundancy. SEE: G Suite's productivity updates could win Google some fans in the enterprise The Nearline tier is for data accessed infrequently, but more often than the Coldline tier. It is the second-cheapest option at $0.01 per GB, per month, and Google touts it as suitable for backup, longtail content, and rarely-accessed documents. It also has a $0.01 per GB retrieval cost. The second most expensive option is the Regional storage tier, which costs $0.02 per GB, per month. It offers millisecond access and is positioned as a good fit for transcoding, data analytics, and general computing. Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy The price drops are a step in the right direction for Google, but the big three cloud providers (AWS, Google, Microsoft Azure) have been competing so heavily on price that it is almost table-stakes at this point. The bigger issues for Google, at least in terms of cloud storage, are features and functionality. In the IaaS and PaaS space, Google is only really competing with Amazon and Microsoft, but the storage space has a broader set of competitors, often with more useful features for professionals. For example, in Google, it's difficult to change the ownership of an article. Also, providers such as Dropbox and Box seem to offer more granular access and permissions for each file and folder. Google did recently update its G Suite apps with new productivity features which could improve collaboration, and it needs to continue on that track to win over business customers. Earlier this year, at the Google Cloud Platform Next conference, Google announced that it had signed up a host of major enterprise customers. And, these lower prices could help it continue to attract big businesses. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google dropped the pricing on all of its cloud storage tiers and added a new option for cold storage called Coldline. Google is well positioned to compete with other providers on price, but needs stronger features and functionality for enterprise users. This further solidifies Google's push with big business, after it announced multiple enterprise clients back in March. Click here to subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter.

Licklider was bringing his dream of the “Intergalactic Computer Network” to fruition with ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency).  ARPANET would go on to become the foundation for the internet as we know it today. At that time, computing was limited to enterprises relying on mainframes for bulk data processing. Ironically, many of the fundamental principles of mainframe computing are still in use with cloud computing.     Fast forward to the late 1990s when Marc Benioff started delivering enterprise-level applications over the internet with Salesforce. Shortly thereafter, many of the big cloud players we know today entered the picture.  Amazon Web Services launched its first platform in 2002, and in 2009 Google released Google Apps, a suite of browser-based office applications which sought to antiquate Microsoft’s desktop-based office applications. Microsoft, in response to Google Apps, launched its Business Productivity Office Suite (BPOS), which simply migrated desktop applications to the cloud.   Today, cloud services are rampant, and cloud migrations seem a mere formality. It’s no longer a matter of if one should move to the cloud, but when and how.   Rising Demand for the Hybrid Cloud In the early 2010s, few technologists were disputing the operational benefits of cloud computing. However, cloud migrations presented certain technical constraints around security, compliance and availability.  As a result of those constraints, the need for a sort of computing bridge was realized. The manifestation of that bridge was the hybrid cloud, a combination of traditional data centers and cloud solutions.  These hybrid solutions allowed organizations to leverage many operational benefits of the cloud while maintaining security, compliance and stability. In short, hybrid solutions let organizations embrace the cloud at their own pace.   How Hybrid SharePoint Came to Be Microsoft’s first iteration of SharePoint was released in 2001, as the spiritual successor to Site Server. SharePoint’s initial function was to provide organizations with the tools they need to enhance productivity.  Over the years, the once bug-riddled SharePoint grew into the content management system we’re now familiar with.  As SharePoint matured, cloud computing stormed onto the scene and changed everything. Businesses quickly realized the benefits of the cloud, and the demand for cloud services soared as a result.  Ever opportunistic, Microsoft released Office 365 to answer that demand. SharePoint was late to join the cloud party due to the previously mentioned constraints, but IT departments were still intrigued by applying the benefits of the cloud to internal content management. Hybrid SharePoint emerged to balance the compliance and security needs, with the operational benefits of cloud.   Hybrid SharePoint Today Today, organizations are empowered to exercise end-to-end control of their SharePoint deployment.  Want to go completely cloud? Go ahead Want to remain entirely on-premises? Your call Want a customized hybrid solution? Go for it  Hybrid SharePoint’s features are robust and practical, so much so that the average user is unable to tell what sort of computing infrastructure is responsible for serving up the content they need. Previously, instances of SharePoint Online would have to operate almost independently of SharePoint on-premises.  That’s no longer the case with Microsoft’s focus on Hybrid unification. Check out these three new features: Unified search: IT administrators have long dealt with the headache of disparate search results pages. Searching SharePoint Online would return different results compared to searching SharePoint on-premises. Now, regardless of where content is hosted, it’s indexable and searchable    Unified taxonomy: Allows administrators to easily create shared taxonomies between on-premises SharePoint and SharePoint Online  Unified auditing: Administrators can now analyze detailed logs of file activity across site collections, and Office 365 Hybrid SharePoint Tomorrow So what can we expect from SharePoint Hybrid computing in the future? At Ignite, Microsoft talked about the future in broad strokes but didn’t reveal specifics.  With that being said, I would predict: Point and click cloud migration: Doesn’t it just feel as though you should be able to click on an on-premises hosted site, and migrate it to a cloud location?  Microsoft, if you are listening, this should be a standard feature of SharePoint: “one-click site move to the cloud.” Updated UX: Some days SharePoint just plain stinks. The user experience feels outdated, and accessing content requires too many clicks. Microsoft is bringing modern experience to the cloud and soon to follow on-premises. What do you think the future has in store for SharePoint Hybrid?

China's LeEco sets out to shake up US consumer tech market From the Associated Press Oct 20, 2016 AP Photo | Jeff Chiu Rob Chandhok, LeEco North America chief research and development officer, holds a LePro 3 phone while speaking at an event in San Francisco, Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2016. SAN FRANCISCO — Most U.S. consumers haven't heard of LeEco, but the Chinese technology company is setting out to become a household name with smartphones and flat-screen TVs that undercut the prices of Apple, Google, Samsung and other industry stalwarts. LeEco heralded its entrance into the U.S. market during a Wednesday showcase in San Francisco, where the company unveiled a sleek smartphone called the LePro 3 that will sell for $400 and an internet-connected TV with a 7-foot screen priced at $5,000. LeEco positions the LePro 3 as an alternative to Apple's latest iPhone and Google's Pixel phone, whose prices both start at $650. LeEco is promising its giant TV, called the UMax 85, will be as good or better than other high-end home entertainment systems that cost $8,000. Both the phone and TV will go on sale Nov. 2 in LeEco's online store, LeWeb.com. The company also is selling a smaller smartphone and smaller TVs with screens ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches. Besides the phones and TVs, LeEco also is coming to the U.S. with a virtual-reality headset, a high-tech bicycle and an electric car in a challenge to Tesla Motors. The company wants to bundle the devices with other services, including an online video package of shows and movies that ties into its origins as the "Netflix of China." LeEco, which stands for "Happy Ecosystem," is branching out to challenge technology leaders who have been able to demand a premium for their products partly because they have been pleasing U.S. consumers for years. "America is the most important global market for us," LeEco CEO Jia Yueting said through a translator during a presentation. "Once we get the hearts and minds of U.S. users, we can move on to the hearts and minds of global users." Innovation in the U.S. has hit a "bottleneck," making it an optimal time for LeEco to enter the market, Jia said in an interview with The Associated Press that was also translated. He envisions creating a platform that enables consumers to hopscotch from LeEco TVs to phones to cars to watch its video service and use other applications that that company plans to introduce. The company is using the devices as "Trojan horses," to deliver its digital services, said Gartner analyst Werner Goertz. "This is a general trend in the industry, and LeEco is a prime example of how companies are subsidizing hardware with ulterior motives." Google is similarly selling its new Pixel phone in an effort to drive more traffic to its search engine and other service, Goertz noted, though that device is being sold at a premium price. Amazon.com's Echo, an internet-connected speaker that understands and responds to spoken language, also is designed to get boost sales at the company's e-commerce site. The expectations for LeEco are modest. The research firm Strategy Analytics projects that LeEco will sell about 25 million smartphones worldwide this year. By comparison, Apple had sold 214 million iPhones in the past year ending in June. Other Chinese companies that tried to make a splash in the U.S. consumer electronics market have barely made a ripple. But LeEco is making a major commitment. During the summer, the company paid $2 billion for budget-TV maker Vizio, a well-known brand in the U.S. that sells in Costco and other prominent chains. It employs several hundred workers at its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, California, with ambitions to expand in Silicon Valley. Earlier this year, it spent another $250 million to snap up a 50-acre site in Santa Clara, California, where it has approval to build an office complex that could span up to 3 million square feet and accommodate about 12,000 workers. Jia plans to call the complex "EcoWorld." "They are not taking a half-baked approach," Goertz said. "But I think they are going to be hemorrhaging money for the foreseeable future. The question is how long they can sustain this strategy?" Jia, who has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $5 billion, will shoulder a huge chunk of any losses because he owns half of LeEco. He declined to say how much LeEco has spent in the U.S. so far. "We are financially prepared to bring a new model and a new value for the U.S. consumers," Jia said.

You’re the country that welcomed in a six year old boy from Russia, Sergey Brin — who would one day co-found Google. You’re the people who offered refuge to Andy Grove, a Hungarian who hid from the Nazis as a kid, who came to America and founded one of the leaders in the global tech industry — Intel — and you’re the country who made a home for a scared Ukranian teen, Jan Koum, and gave his family food stamps to stay alive — and that same kid would one day co-found Whatsapp that just sold for $19 billion. No debate or vote or campaign can undermine it, because it’s undeniable and all of you, America, hold these truths to be self-evident — that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness — and you will hold on to each other no matter what because you not only believe these things, you aim to live these things no matter what. Because America? You’re a great incubator of dreams, a lab for human possibilities, a seedbed for visions of hope to grow, a beacon of refuge and liberty to the tired and huddled masses and an election doesn’t change the DNA of who you are, a campaign season cannot undo the heart of you that beats from the winding sublimeness of Highway 1 to the general stores of the Blue Ridge Parkway, and no vote can derail that you’re a family who knows that if an election is allowed to destroy friendships, then it’s America that loses. If an election is allowed to destroy friendships, then it’s America that loses. Thank you, America, for being the people who know that —- no matter who takes the White House in November, there are people in God’s House who will keep taking hope into the streets. Thank you, America, for knowing that ultimately good news isn’t the wheelhouse of the government —- it’s ultimately the reality of the gospel. Thank you, America, for being a pioneering people who believe in Seed Lives, who believe in breaking hard ground, who aren’t afraid to plow deeper to grow greater, who believe that the smallest seeds of kindness can begin to break the worst kind of brokenness The smallest seeds of kindness can begin to break the worst kind of brokenness. The world thanks you, America — for believing in liberty, for hoping in possibility, for fighting against poverty, and bigotry, and misery, for living neighbourly, and choosing unity and accepting diversity and being grace in community.

By Nick Heath | October 20, 2016, 8:53 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/KeongDaGreat The smash hit game Pokemon Go provided perhaps the ultimate test of the claim that cloud computing can scale to meet demand. The augmented reality, collect-em-up has been downloaded more than 500 million times, making it one of the most popular mobile apps of 2016. The sheer number of people hankering to catch Pokemon not only generated headlines, it also caught Pokemon Go's creators Niantic by surprise. The game, which relies on more than a dozen Google Cloud Platform services, created far more network traffic than Niantic's thought possible, ultimately generating five times the demand Niantic expected under its worst case scenario. The first sign that they may have underestimated player numbers came within 15 minutes of launching Pokemon Go, which initially went live in Australia and New Zealand, when player traffic ballooned to levels far beyond Niantic's expectations. "We ended up 50 percent over our worst case after day one, we figured this was going to be bad within six hours," Phil Keslin, CTO at Niantic told the Google Cloud Platform Next conference in London. "It was a hair on fire experience." Niantic's projections were far below actual traffic generated by Pokemon Go's initial launch. Image: Niantic/Google Making the clamour for the game even more challenging was the small size of Niantic's engineering team handling the launch for Pokemon Go. "The team that made this happen was four engineers," said Keslin. Given the unexpected surge for the Australia and New Zealand launch, Niantic appealed to Google for help with the US release the next day. Niantic worked with about 40 Google Cloud Platform staff, from Customer Reliability Engineering and Site Reliability Engineering, development, product, support and executive teams, to ramp up the allocated infrastructure to cope with traffic levels far higher than originally envisioned. However, the launch period didn't pass without incident, following the US and Australian launch, players complained of downtime and dropped connections, as Google Cloud Platform services such as Google BigQuery and BigTable came under unforeseen pressure. "BigTable, BigQuery, everything was blowing up when this was happening," said Keslin. The problems even prompted Werner Vogels, CTO at Google Cloud Platform rival Amazon Web Services to tweet asking Niantic to let him know if there was anything AWS could do to help. Niantic and Google worked together to solve each issue, reviewing each part of the architecture used to identify the source of each problem. Complicating the matter of resolving issues were the millions of new players joining the game each day. In an operation described as 'swapping out a plane's engine in-flight', Google and Niantic upgraded Pokemon Go to run on a newer version of Google Container Engine (GKE) at a time when millions of new players were signing up to play the game. The move allowed more than one thousand additional nodes to be added to Pokemon Go's container cluster, in preparation for the high demand expected for the forthcoming launch in Japan. Other upgrades carried out on the live production system, included replacing the Network Load Balancer with the more sophisticated HTTP/S Load Balancer, in order to offer faster connections to users and a higher overall traffic throughput. The upshot was the launch in Japan passed off without incident, despite the number of new users signing up to play being triple that of the earlier US launch. "We had people on the Google side reprovisioning resources to get us where we needed to be," said Keslin. "That saved our bacon." Click here to subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter.

By Harmeet Singh October 20, 2016 Best Buy Canada has announced a new partnership with Google Canada, which will bring 14 “Google shops” into its stores. The collaboration is the first of its kind in North America and will involve Best Buy hosting 14 of the shops in its newly renovated “experience stores.” Ten, smaller versions of those shops will begin operating today across Canada. Four more are set to debut in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Mississauga before the end of the year. Those shops will be larger (around 700 square feet) and more interactive, featuring things like surround screens. The shops will include Google’s hardware – such as the new Pixel smartphone, Daydream View VR headset and Chromecast Ultra (the latter two available later this year)  – and will “provide immersive experiences that help users get the most out of their devices,” Best Buy said in a press release. For all 14 shops, customers can book one-on-one appointments with Google staff to learn more about specific products. Given that Google doesn’t release new hardware products as often as other tech brands, the shops are largely experiential, with workshops focused on how to get the most out of its various products and apps Examples include a hands-on experience of Google Play Games, a workshop to plan the ideal holiday trip using Google hardware and apps, and “family time with Google,” a workshop for kids and friendly focused on child-friendly products.

Fifty percent of all proceeds from sales of the shirt will go to benefit Planned Parenthood. How is it that Trump would help create anything that benefits an organization dedicated to promoting women’s reproductive health, you ask? Allow us to present the following clip of last night’s final 2016 Presidential Debate: For those who don’t have the desire to hear Trump’s voice this early in the day, this particular exchange between candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump went as follows: Hillary Clinton: My social security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald’s, assuming he can’t figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the social security trust fund — Donald Trump: Such a nasty woman. Hillary Clinton: — by making sure that we have sufficient resources… It’s worth noting that, minutes before this manterruption, Trump had said, and we quote, “Nobody has more respect for women than I do, nobody. Nobody has more.” (The room exploded with laughter, the moderator called for quiet, we at home continued laughing…) Suffice it to say, the whole event left the public with many new Donald-isms aka meme-fodder (“Bigly,” “We have some bad hombres” and “No, you’re a puppet!” have been circulating the Internet like wildfire). Of them, “Such a nasty woman” was by far the least funny (un-bigly funny?). Plus, the timing and hypocrisy of the statement was not lost on the audience. Fed up with Trump’s immaturity, his discriminatory — and predatory — comments about women, and his general ineptitude, feminists immediately took to social media to reclaim the phrase #NastyWoman. From one #NastyWoman to another, you were an inspiration last night, @HillaryClinton. -NP — Team Pelosi (@TeamPelosi) October 20, 2016 When an idiot is out of place and doesn’t have a proper response to a question, he will resort to name calling. #nastywoman — Lisa (@Raiderette517) October 20, 2016 I’m a nasty woman and I vote. #nastywoman #nastywomenunite — Kate Binder (@katebinder) October 20, 2016 Winning women are usually called names. @HillaryClinton #nastywoman — Lioness (@twitjaq) October 20, 2016 I guess a woman is viewed as nasty if she has a strong opinion and isn’t afraid to stick up for her beliefs. #nastywoman — Haley (@Haley_Kawaii) October 20, 2016 FOMO that I can’t identify as a #NastyWoman tonight but thrilled I can at least vote for one. — Andy Mientus (@andymientus) October 20, 2016 RT if you’re a #NastyWoman who’s headed to the polls to vote for your rights — Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) October 20, 2016 Single #nastywoman seeks single #badhombre for sipping wine, long walks on the beach, good conversation. — terisaylor (@terisaylor) October 20, 2016 Well behaved women rarely make history #nastywoman pic.twitter.com/fEoKIfbjyO — Ruth Lapointe (@Ruth1Lapointe) October 20, 2016 But topical apparel retailer Google Ghost took it one step further, immediately (the shirt went live before midnight) designing a top that would not only shade Trump but benefit the healthcare organization he’s targeted throughout his campaign. The heartfelt design is cute, to-the-point and mildly Rodarte-reminiscent, wouldn’t you say? Alternatively, if you believe a picture is worth a hundred feminist catchphrases, may we suggest making your own donation to Planned Parenthood, then nabbing this $35 Rihanna-approved gem by Trapvilla: A photo posted by Rihanna Daily (@rihannadaily) on Oct 20, 2016 at 6:11am PDT Beyond amazing.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google releases Wallpapers, Pixel Launcher on the Play Store By R Padla - October 20, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Both the Pixel and Pixel XL are now in full swing. Google is busy marketing the phones before their market release and even way before the October 4 launch. We’ve been reading mixed reviews about the Pixel phones but it’s too early to judge although we already have our own Pixel review. We said the two really are phones designed by Google for people who love Google. If you’re getting a Pixel or Pixel XL, be glad to know that Google is committed to making the smartphone fully Google. Each runs Android 7.1 Nougat already but with some modifications that are very Google. You can say it’s a custom OEM Android but it really is just Nougat. To add to the whole Pixel game, Google has also released new apps. The Wallpapers and Pixel Launcher were developed to enhance the whole mobile experience. Wallpapers app is available for both the Pixel and Pixel XL. It allows you to change wallpapers and set advanced features. You have many choices from your own gallery and images from Google+ or Google Earth. Change your wallpaper, both home and lock screen, as often as you like each day. Sometimes, having a new wallpaper on your phone is enough to make your day brighter. The Pixel Launcher app brings a new home screen experience for the new Pixel phones. You can get personalized information with a single swipe because the launcher will show you just what you need. You can also see timely Google Cards and access Google Search quickly when you swipe right. Just swipe up the screen from the bottom and you will see your Favorite apps. With the Pixel Launcher, App Suggestions can bring the app you need immediately while long-pressing on the apps with shortcuts will quickly jump into what you need to access. An update was recently sent to the Pixel Launcher app and so the weather now appears in the top right corner of the screen. There’s also the new circular folder presentations while the wallpaper picker has been refreshed. Download Wallpapers and Pixel Launcher from the Google Play Store Story Timeline Nexus Launcher will now be known as Pixel Launcher Pixel Launcher to feature rounded app icons, pressure-sensitive shortcuts Pixel phones from Google Store will be rootable, bootloaders unlockable Google Pixel Review: Android redefined, by Google Google Pixel, Pixel XL listed on Google Store but now out of stock TAGS Android Apps Google launcher Pixel Pixel XL wallpaper Must Read Google Home Review: Feeling at home with Google Assistant This is the Huawei Mate 9 and its Porsche Design twin Huawei Fit hands-on: fitness tracker in smartwatch clothing Stay Connected 883,798FansLike 136,403FollowersFollow 102,861FollowersFollow 469,000FollowersFollow 59,238SubscribersSubscribe About Contact Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise © 2016 Android Community - Part of R3 Media LLC

Google this week released the developer preview of Android Nougat 7.1. Nougat 7.1 comes pre-loaded on Google's new Pixel smartphones, and lets you swipe up from the bottom for a quick view of your apps, among other things. Everyone else will get it on a rolling basis; Google is starting with a beta version for developers with Nexus devices (Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel C) so they can "tease out any device-specific issues." It will then arrive on other devices in November before the final public release to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) in December. The 7.1 preview "gives you everything you need to test your app on the new platform or extend it with new features," Dave Burke, vice president of engineering, wrote in a blog post. Features like circular launcher icons to match Google's new Pixel phones and support for image keyboards (inserts stickers and GIFs in text). Engadget also tipped a new restart button in the power menu. Developers can enroll in the Android Beta program online and opt in to receive OTA preview updates. Feedback is welcome via the Developer Preview issue tracker, N Preview Developer community, and Android Beta community. Nougat includes more than 250 "major features," including more personalization and productivity options, better power management, support for advanced 3D and VR platforms like Daydream, and upgraded security. For more, see PCMag's review and our roundup of Nougat tips. If you're planning to pick up a 128GB Pixel XL at a Verizon Wireless store today, meanwhile, think again. 4/6 NEWS! Initial inventory of Pixel XL 128GB is SOLD OUT... NOT in stores Thurs. All other models in stock. Get to Verizon early! — Jeffrey Nelson (@JNels) October 19, 2016 Shipping estimates have been pushed to Nov. 18 on Verizon's website. Shoppers too impatient to wait can make the choice between a 5.5-inch XL size with 32GB of internal storage or the 5-inch handset in 32GB or 128GB.

I think not. Vito R. They weren’t available last week, the release date is today. Patrick O’Rourke Reporting mobile news is what we do. When a phone is available at carriers, we’re going to update our readers with pricing. If you’re not interested in the story, just skip it 🙂 Dimitri Maybe you should be reading the site more often to know the device just got released today… Dimitri Go look at the Rogers Community forums. No one that has a reservation for the XL 128GB had theirs shipped or anything. Might want to put that in ur article as well. No Telus and no Rogers store has that model in black or silver. John Rogers has the silver. Just played with it Dimitri Which location? No one is able to find one in Toronto. Called about 8 stores. John Winnipeg. They have stock. Both sizes and colors but yeah only the 32 gig Raphael Del Castillo Yeah I preordered the pixel xl 128 in silver.. no word on my shipment. Google might be backordered until next week. Mr_Smoosh Looking forward to playing with one in the store. May change my mind seeing it in person after the sticker shock. Arman Thinking about doing the same but thinking about the price will change my mind back again not to buy it lol Garrett Cooper This is where I’m at. Not sure it’ll be good enough to drop the cash when I have a perfectly fine Z5. But that might change after playing with it. I do miss Nexus “smoothness”. DOmega And no financing options available to buy outright. It’s like Google actually supports the shitty treatment we get from carriers. Arman Not to mention its 30% more expensive in Canada too, we are always treated like second class citizens here. Screw them, not buying it. S7 edge still has a better camera and battery life and you can buy it unlocked for $760 CAD online although I think that’s overpriced too but thats the CAD to blame. Rony You can blame shity CAD . Not Google. S7 better camera? hmmmm don’t think so. Arman watch?v=66tRKyJLTPo watch?v=vG711jCHDOA Adam Watts The S7 has a better camera according to what review? Arman See them for yourself on Y0utube: watch?v=66tRKyJLTPo watch?v=vG711jCHDOA Vito R. How is it 30% more expensive? Are you comparing $US vs $CDN? Feel free to go across the border to buy it then. The exchange rate is currently no lMORE than $1.30CDN per $1US. Arman It’s $1.32 but yes. Vito R. So you’re complaining about the exchange rate… And pretty much every review our there says the Pixel is in the top 3 for best camera. Yes, the S7 does better in low light, but overall the Pixel is great because it *consistently* takes great pics and is very fast. Do I think it’s worth $900 no, but I do think it’s the best Android phone on there market. Arman Yes no doubt its a great phone, but what’s the point if most of us won’t buy it. They should adjust their prices for each country not just the exchange rate with $US IMO. jay the pixel is only 400$ Arman On which planet? I’ll move there tonight 😛 jay lol Ali F. I will buy it on 2018. Whome Good for those who can spend a grand on a phone. EWZ Available at Fido as well (on website): Pixel 32 / 128GB => $400 / $530 on 2-year plus35 plan Pixel XL 32 / 128GB => $550 / $680 on 2-year plus35 plan Puts this in the same league as iPhone 7… quite a steep introductory price. Arman A decent plan for it is going to be $100. Adding that to the price will end up something like $1700 fro the phone after 2 years. Not sure what they are thinking! Garrett Cooper Telus is only $200 for a 32GB? Half of Bell? Is that correct? Phil – it – up Yes but the amount you pay monthly is higher on Telus, so at the end of the contract you’ve paid the same amount regardless of the carrier you choose. Austin Hi Garrett, I work as a Telus rep and can provide you with a better plan with the phone at $200. Let me know if you are interested. You can email me at austin.tsai@apexwireless.ca. Adam Watts Is Bell never selling th 128? Or just not yet? Nicolas Racine What, no love from Videotron? Techguru86 I played with both at the rogers store today, but wasn’t impressed with HTc with this, looks like a IPod Touch, camera seemed slower on the Pixel but the Xl was fine mike m THEY ARE NO AVAILABLE!! i got my 32 gig after a lot of searching. although i originally ordered 128, i was told 128 will not come in for 4 weeks.. thanks for nothing Rogers Bob Loblaw Hilarious prices. I think I’ll go for the OP3 instead. Phones shouldn’t be costing as much as a laptop. Vito R. Really? Quality laptops cost $400? Fabe Bell store in Calgary has it on display but no buy out right and no 128, also Costco in East hills has 128 and 32 Vito R. @patrick It’s called REALLY Blue. Patrick O’Rourke The blue Pixel isn’t being sold in Canada, at least not yet. Steve Any word if the devices sold by Carriers will be unlocked like Nexus device’s were? I can understand why they are doing it in the US since Verizon is the exclusive Carrier and also pushing the OS updates instead of Google. But Canadian carriers have confirmed OS updates in Canada are coming directly from Google like Nexus was. Roger As I’ve said before, use of tables is better for this kind of information. jay oh that is a good deal 400$ for the pixel i thought they sell them for 650$ maybe i will get one. not sure but 549$ for the XL is a bit pricy but thinking how much the iPhone 7 is 899$ still a good deal. hahahaha what a joke 400 on contract. they should not drink more … KayArePea You’re aware that the iPhone 7 has a smaller screen and is… well… Apple, right? Granted, the Pixel is a little over priced, but compared to other flagship phones on the market, it’s not out of touch with reality. Just going to have to get used to either not buying flagship phones, or paying over a grand for them all said and done. Kind of like getting used to precarious jobs I guess 😉 jay pixel over priced? KayArePea Clearly it is. Though all flagship phones are overpriced now, thanks to Crapple and their iDump phones. But even through this lens, the pixel is still a bit overpriced imo. A Note 7 was priced lower than the top tier pixel, came with an option of a free memory card (therefore had 256gb sd card and 64gb internal, compared to 128 internal), had a pen, edge screen (debatable if that’s good or not), and was waterproof. Missing those features, I’d have hoped to see the pixel xl 128 to be priced about where an S7 is priced at. I’d actually hoped to see it even lower, given its Google and they have traditionally priced their phones much more reasonably. But given the current market and climate, where a thousand bucks for a phone isn’t considered to be absolutely bonkers, I guess it’s within reason to charge 1200 for a top tier phone…. Dico0810 Does anybody know if the Pixel phones sold by the carriers come unlocked? I have bought the Nexus phones in the past directly from google, so I am not sure if when purchased from a carrier it would come locked. The Pixel seems to be a great phone, but at that price tag, its quite difficult to think about purchasing it a la Nexus in the past. Jason McDonagh I have been looking for 128gb from Rogers & can’t find anywhere in the gta. Anyone have any luck? Jean-Francois Watier Montreal north shore, didn’t see any over here…its like the holy grail… KayArePea None available from Telus or Koodo out Rogers at all in Canada from what I’m told by the reps I’ve spoken with. Rather pissed a Telus told me there would be one waiting for me on launch day in trade for my Note 7. I’ve new missed two chances to buy one now. Telus is trying to tell me they will claw back my port in credit if I don’t get a replacement phone through them…. Calling the crtc tomorrow to see if that’s even legal – I don’t think it is. If you cancel with them, they can only charge you the outstanding balance on your phone, but since my Note is recalled there is no balance when I return it. Jean-Francois Watier They said the XL 128 gig is available but I did’nt manage to see one, anywhere…I believe they didn’t receive any(montreal north shore area). Did you guy’s manage to grab one? Polinompol It seems like you can’t buy a Pixel XL in Canada without going to contract. So sad. Almost feels like a conspiracy of google and operators to put you on expensive plan.

Sure, you might stumble upon a ZIP file chock full of quality scribblings every once in a while or a well-curated storefront here and there, but acquiring wallpapers is a generally arduous undertaking. It’s a process, in fact, that can take almost as much time as choosing one. Well, Google’s here to help. On Thursday, the Mountain View, California-based giant released a new app for Android, Wallpapers, that packs an extraordinary number of illustrations, images, and photography with which to spruce up your mobile. In terms of functionality, Wallpapers is relatively bare bones. It’s in essence a curated portal: open the app and you’re presented with dazzling collections of satellite imagery from Google Earth, a Google collection drawn from its topographical mapping service; landscape photography from partners like 500px; architectural highlights by city, region, country, and continent; a variety of textures and materials; and artwork of a generally abstract nature. Every wallpaper in the collection includes an “explore” tab that provides details on the artist, and, if applicable, the location. Related: Google Pixel XL review If you’re the indecisive sort, there’s an option to set a live wallpaper that’ll rotate the artwork on your device’s home screen every day. And if you’re lucky enough to have a device running Android 7.0 Nougat or later, you can set different images for both your home screen and lock screen. google_wallpapers_phone-0More If all that sounds a little familiar, that’s probably because Google’s Pixel phones ship with a similar set of wallpaper customization tools. In fact, the new Wallpapers seems almost identical in appearance to the Pixels’ artwork picker, down to the Wallpaper app’s “live wallpapers,” or animated artwork of the Earth from outer space, solar phenomenon, and scenic vistas. That last bit’s a tad unexpected: Google has previously implied that live wallpapers would remain exclusive to its newly-launched Pixel smartphones. “Wallpapers serve as the very first touchpoint for users and help establish a premium experience and build an emotional connection,” Google wrote in a blog post announcing live wallpapers. “For the Pixel, we wanted to design an experience that was both inherent and unique to Google.” But the surprise is a welcome one — in this writer’s opinion, the search giant’s live wallpapers are by far the collection’s most entrancing.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Google's Pixel Phone: Not Much New, But Still a Standout By Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 20 2016 Google's ambitious new smartphone, the Pixel, doesn't offer a lot that's new. Yet it's still one of the best out there. Google achieves that by pulling together the best features from Apple, Samsung and other phone makers and offering them at prices comparable to iPhones -- starting at about $650 for the regular, 5-inch model and $770 for the 5.5-inch "XL" edition. Both versions go on sale Thursday through Verizon, Best Buy and Google's online store. I tested the Pixel XL model; the regular version has identical features except for its smaller display and battery -- still enough for 13 hours of internet use, according to Google. With either, you get an excellent camera and a strong voice assistant that promises to get smarter -- all without the bloat common with other Android phones. The Pixel isn't quite an iPhone replacement, as Google wants you to believe ; hardware is just part of what makes an iPhone an iPhone. But it might serve up a strong challenge to Samsung, especially as people look for alternatives to the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 . The Camera The Pixel's image quality is superb -- though purists may quibble. Colors in some shots look too strong and clean to me, thanks to software processing intended to reduce distortion and improve detail (something all phones do to some extent). But automation pays off in another way: The Pixel will automatically combine successive shots into an animated "GIF" file, offering a fun way to share a toddler's steps or a dog jumping. For video, the Pixel's stabilization technology compensates for shaky hands and other movement, matching what the iPhone and Galaxy phones can do. The Pixel borrows a quick-launch feature from Samsung phones. Just double tap the power button to start the camera, even if the phone is locked. To switch between the front and rear cameras, just double twist the phone like a door knob -- a feature Motorola, which Google once owned, has long offered. Low-light images taken with the Pixel in three museums aren't as crisp as those from the iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7 (which has the same camera as the Note 7). But differences are small, and the Pixel does better than typical smartphones. Where the Pixel falls short is in extreme close-ups, such as shooting a flower petal or a small bug; photos were typically blurry. The Pixel's selfie camera is also inferior, with no front flash or control over the focus. But it's fine in good light and at typical distances for selfies. The Assistant Google's voice assistant, simply known as Google Assistant, will seem familiar to those who have used Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa features. Google's version goes further in offering daily updates such as weather and news, though plenty of apps already offer similar capabilities through notifications. Google is also better at remembering preferences -- say, if you prefer temperatures in Celsius -- and at integrating with its own services, such as Translate and Photos. But Assistant doesn't yet sync with a similar Assistant in Google's Allo chat app and upcoming Home speaker. And it isn't as proactive as the Google Now assistant already built into Android phones. Google Now, for instance, will look through your Gmail account for flight reservations and remind you when to head to the airport. It will analyze your daily commute and warn of delays. Assistant waits for you to ask. Assistant holds up well compared with Siri and Alexa, but for more, swipe from left to right to get the old Google Now back. Google says Assistant will eventually get the Google Now functionality. Other Features If you need help, you can reach Google's customer support and enable screen sharing reminiscent of Amazon's Mayday help feature. And the Pixel will work with Google's upcoming Daydream View virtual-reality headset, much as Samsung phones have Samsung's Gear VR. Long-pressing an app icon brings up a menu of shortcuts, such as getting directions to home or launching the selfie camera. It's similar to the iPhone's 3D Touch. The Pixel also offers "Night Light," a feature that tints your screen amber by filtering out blue light that might keep you up at night. Apple calls it Night Shift. Pixel owners get unlimited storage of photos at original resolution, though that's a little like offering Google search for free. Google Photos already offers unlimited storage at up to 16 megapixels; the Pixel's camera is 12 megapixels. The free offer will make a difference for those who take video in ultra-sharp "4k" resolution, but the default setting is lower, at 1080p, which is already free at Google Photos. What's Missing The Pixel will be OK if you spray it with water, but don't drop it in the pool. You also can't expand its storage with a memory card, as you can with the S7 and Note 7 -- though for $100 more, the Pixel's 32 gigabytes of storage quadruples to 128 gigabytes, and the free online storage should take care of your photos and videos. The battery isn't removable, though that's true for most phones these days. Those looking for a Note 7 replacement will find the Pixel missing a stylus. If you're an iPhone user, you'll have to brace yourself for the switch to Android, which would entail buying new apps and learning new ways to navigate. Making the Switch Google tries to make it easy to switch. The phone comes with a transfer cable, and the set-up process walks you through transferring photos, music and video, as long as it's not encrypted (so scratch iTunes video). But apps won't switch over from iPhones; you need to buy them again. © 2016 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

(Photo: Monty Brinton, CBS) Google has struck a deal to carry CBS Corp.’s broadcast network on its planned pay-TV streaming service, signing its first major content partner for a project designed to compete with cable and satellite TV providers. Also included in the deal are CBS Sports Network and Pop, a cable channel that is a joint venture between CBS and Lionsgate, according to a person familiar with the deal. The person spoke anonymously because the partnership isn’t ready to be announced. Google’s YouTube seeks to join a growing list of video providers that are negotiating with cable and broadcast networks to stream their content to subscribers in their "over-the-top" live TV service. Google’s Unplugged service, marketed as a cheaper option to cable TV, is scheduled to launch next year. Sling TV and PlayStation Vue currently offer live Internet TV subscriptions, and Hulu also plans to launch a similar product next year. While Google's service hopes to land all major networks, signing CBS is significant as it airs some of the most popular shows on TV, including NCIS, The Big Bang Theory and NFL football. Google is also in talks with Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, as well as Walt Disney Co., owner of ABC and ESPN, and 21st Century Fox, whose assets include Fox, Fox News and Fox Sports. Google is considering a price range of $25 to $40 a month for the service, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal. YouTube declined to comment. CBS Corp. has dabbled in its own experiment to stream its TV programming. Available on major streaming devices, such as Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and XBox, CBS All Access, which charges subscribers $6 a month, streams the network's shows as they air or on demand. In its deal with Google, CBS negotiated to receive a per-viewer fee somewhere between $2 it receives from traditional pay-TV companies and $6 charged for CBS All Access customers, the person said.

The first phase of Cornell Tech, which aims to be a model for a new kind of high-tech university as well as an engine for the local economy, is on track to be completed in the summer of 2017, according to a briefing Wednesday, marking the start of the 12-month countdown of the opening of the graduate program's Roosevelt Island campus. The presentation, at the school's temporary quarters inside Google's offices in Chelsea, touted the school's progress so far. Since the first class launched in January 2013, nearly 200 Cornell Tech alumni have graduated and 29 startups, of which 93% are headquartered in New York, have been created. The new companies have collectively raised $12 million in funding. More than 70% of the graduates have remained in New York, contributing their advanced computer science and business skills to small startups as well as big companies like Google and Verizon, according to Cornell Tech Dean and Vice Provost Daniel Huttenlocher. Cornell Tech also includes an M.B.A. program. Currently, there are about 200 students enrolled in the program, which was a signature project of Michael Bloomberg's administration. The former mayor envisioned the school as a kind of East Coast version of Stanford University, which is known for the role it played in the development of Silicon Valley and the close relationship it continues to have with the Bay Area's tech community. Cornell Tech's first three buildings, which will mark the school's cutting-edge character, are taking shape. They include the campus' first academic building, the Bloomberg Center—powered by a geothermal system and rooftop solar panels—and the Bridge, a "co-location" building designed for use by both industry and academia. The Bridge will be managed by its developer, Forest City Ratner, and will include co-working space. An outside operator will be tapped to oversee the co-working space, said Andrew Winters, Cornell Tech's senior director of capital projects. The House, an apartment tower for faculty and students, will also open next September. At 270 feet tall, it will be the first high-rise built to "passive house" standards of low energy consumption. "When our new campus opens on Roosevelt Island, it will be the first campus built from the ground up in the digital age," Huttenlocher said. "The rapid pace of innovation calls for big changes in how we do things." The three buildings, which represent about a third of the entire project, will gradually fill up with more than 700 full-time students. When the entire Roosevelt campus is completed in 2043, it will house more than 2,000 students and several hundred faculty.

Magazine tabs Corning Inc. as economy "superstar" Larry Wilson, Correspondent 11:02 a.m. EDT October 20, 2016 The Economist groups the Twin Tiers’ largest employer with GE, Amazon, Google, Apple and others as top corporations The Economist, a respected British magazine, has tapped Corning Inc. as one of the “superstars” of the global economy, putting the Southern Tier's largest employer in a group that includes GE, Amazon, Google, Apple and others. (Photo: FILE PHOTO) 114 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE CORNING —  The Economist, a respected British magazine, has tapped Corning Inc. as one of the “superstars” of the global economy. That designation lands the Twin Tiers’ largest employer in a group that includes GE, Amazon, Google, Apple and other firms in the forefront of the 21st century corporate life. It wasn’t always like that. A couple of generations ago, Corning — then known as Corning Glass Works — was a family owned company in a rural upstate New York region. Its growth was generally unremarkable. Today it is a publicly owned, global enterprise with nearly $10 billion in annual sales and billions in annual profits, much of which comes from Asia. One of the routes Corning Inc. — the name was adopted in 1989 — took to its new incarnation was patient and significant investment in its core skills. Those skills included developing new glass and ceramic formulations and new manufacturing processes. The large and persistent investments paid off with a series of new products — optical fiber and liquid crystal display glass among them — that remain at the root of the company’s success. Today, The Economist notes, Corning produces much of the world’s glass for consumer electronics and much of the optical fiber for global communications. By continuing to invest in its core skills, Corning muscled its way into the market for cover glass for cell phones and similar devices. It is now expanding its reach to automobiles, where its strong and light Gorilla Glass promises to help improve safety and fuel economy. One of the major engines of Corning’s success is its central research and development complex, Sullivan Park in the Town of Erwin near Corning. The Economist describes Sullivan Park as resembling “a university campus,” and says some of its scientists continue working there into their 90s. Corning has also benefited from its origins as a family owned company, which meant it was originally free to set its own goals and pursue its own course without investor input. The “superstar”designation didn’t come as quickly for Corning Inc. as it did for some of the internet startups like Google and some of the tech giants like Apple. With a few deviations here and there, Corning has grown by relying on its discoveries in its glass laboratories and its application of its manufacturing expertise to those discoveries.

Google typically announces the next Android preview during its Google I/O developer conference held annually in May. This year - for the first time - the preview was made available early so many could test Android 7.0 before launch. Once again, Google is using a developer preview for Android 7.1, so Nexus owners can beta test the latest Google goodies prior to final launch in December. When is Android 7.1 Nougat coming to my phone? Here are two different routes you can take: the traditional developer route and the super-friendly Android Beta Program route. Read on to find out more. Android 7.1 Nougat: What is the developer preview? A developer preview is a "work in progress" build that is released to developers prior to a consumer rollout of the final software. Google offers a preview to collect and incorporate developer feedback. In the case of the Android 7.1 developer preview, as the software has already released on the Pixel and Pixel XL phones, it is being offered at beta quality, i.e., near final. The aim is really to tease out problems with specific devices and allow developers to update apps to support 7.1's new features. Android 7.1 Nougat: Developer preview supported devices In the initial phases Google is offering Android 7.1 for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Pixel C. Additional devices will be added to the programme in November, including the Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player (probably). As the Android 7.1 Nougat developer preview is arriving in beta, it should be stable, but some features may still be subject to change. Android 7.1 Nougat: How can I get the developer preview? Android Beta Program Google wants to make it easier for you to try Android 7.1 Nougat on device, so it's also offering the Android Beta Program that allows anyone enrolled to update their Android devices to the developer preview and receive ongoing, over-the-air updates. It's very much like Microsoft's Windows Insider programme. The beta ran for Android 7.0 Nougat and is very simple, meaning you don't have to get involved in flashing updates or anything complicated. Here's how to get started: Visit android.com/beta to sign-up to the Android Beta Program. Sign into your Google account when prompted. Your eligible devices will be listed on the next page, click to enrol in the Beta Program. Updates will arrive over the air direct to your device. That's it, it's so simple. If you've used the Android Beta Program before and enrolled your device previously, it will already be on the list and will automatically receive the updates when they become available. If you don't want those updates, you can follow the steps above, but then click to "unenrol device". Traditional system image The more traditional way to get the Android Nougat developer preview is to go the system image/manual flashing route. You can download images from Google and then flash them onto your device. Here's the site where you can download them, or you can use the direct links below for specific devices. Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel C This page details how to flash while also providing step-by-step instructions that'll get you going. Keep in mind flashing a system image will wipe all the information off your device, so ensure you back up important data beforehand. Also, flashing additional Android Nougat preview images will cause more data wipes, and if go this route, you will not get automatic OTA updates like you do with the Android Beta Program (as above). Android 7.1 Nougat: Want to know more? Android 7.1 Nougat made its debut on the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. There are some exclusive pixel features included with those devices and we've detailed separately what you're missing out on if you don't have a Pixel device. If you want to know more about Android 7.1 Nougat, take a look through some of the following: Google Pixel exclusive features explored: A cut above the rest of Android?

(Photo: Monty Brinton, CBS) Google has struck a deal to carry CBS Corp.’s broadcast network on its planned pay-TV streaming service, signing its first major content partner for a project designed to compete with cable and satellite TV providers. Also included in the deal are CBS Sports Network and Pop, a cable channel that is a joint venture between CBS and Lionsgate, according to a person familiar with the deal. The person spoke anonymously because the partnership isn’t ready to be announced. Google’s YouTube seeks to join a growing list of video providers that are negotiating with cable and broadcast networks to stream their content to subscribers in their "over-the-top" live TV service. Google’s Unplugged service, marketed as a cheaper option to cable TV, is scheduled to launch next year. Sling TV and PlayStation Vue currently offer live Internet TV subscriptions, and Hulu also plans to launch a similar product next year. While Google's service hopes to land all major networks, signing CBS is significant as it airs some of the most popular shows on TV, including NCIS, The Big Bang Theory and NFL football. Google is also in talks with Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, as well as Walt Disney Co., owner of ABC and ESPN, and 21st Century Fox, whose assets include Fox, Fox News and Fox Sports. Google is considering a price range of $25 to $40 a month for the service, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal. YouTube declined to comment. CBS Corp. has dabbled in its own experiment to stream its TV programming. Available on major streaming devices, such as Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and XBox, CBS All Access, which charges subscribers $6 a month, streams the network's shows as they air or on demand. In its deal with Google, CBS negotiated to receive a per-viewer fee somewhere between $2 it receives from traditional pay-TV companies and $6 charged for CBS All Access customers, the person said.

Released on October 20 across the globe, the search engine giant's phone has been years in the making. Tech fans have been eagerly-awaiting the device, which has seen Google ditch the 'Nexus' name in favour of 'Pixel'. The moniker replaces the former on Google's premium tablets and laptops. The new Pixel is, in Google's words, "the first phone built by Google inside and out". Pre-orders for the phone began on October 4 in the US, UK, Australia, Germany and Canada. The phone will ship to customers and be available in shops on October 20. Where can I buy it from? Pre-orders for the Pixel and Pixel XL are both open either through Google's own online store (click here) or high street store Carphone Warehouse (click here). Alternatively, you can go to the network EE, which has an exclusive right to the Pixel phone in the UK. Members of the media photograph a display of Google's Pixel phone and other products during an event to introduce Google hardware products How much is it? Buying directly from Google or Carphone Warehouse means you can pick up the phones SIM-free and unlocked for the one-off price of £599 for the 5-inch Pixel and £719 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. With EE, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month, 24 month 4GEE plan, which comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for existing customers. The Pixel XL is also available free on a £55.99 a month, 24 month plan, and comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for existing customers.

Alternatively, for just £5 per month more, you can get Pixel and Pixel XL on 4GEE Max plans giving you access to the UK’s fastest 4G speeds, and inclusive access to the BT Sport App for the duration of the plan. Members of the media photograph a display of Google's Pixel phone and other products during an event to introduce Google hardware products What is the phone like, then? The device comes in white, bearing more than a passing resemblance to the iPhone 6, but the smaller Pixel and larger Pixel XL also have 4GB of RAM and the same 12MP camera on the back (8MP on the front). Google has kept the 3.5mm headphone jack in place, unlike Apple which ditched it with the launch of the iPhone 7. Read More Google launches Home speaker to take on Amazon Echo Users can opt for a choice of either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and Google is also offering Pixel owners free unlimited storage for photos and videos through its Google Photos app. Both Pixel phones come pre-installed with the latest version of Android (Nougat), as well as Google's AI-powered assistant Allo and the FaceTime-style app Duo. Members of the media photograph a display of Google's Pixel phone and other products during an event to introduce Google hardware products Is it any good, though? Mirror Online have been one of the first to review the smartphone. They write: "For Android purists, the Google Pixel is the best phone you can buy - even if it costs the same as Apple’s high priced iPhone 7. "When it comes to design, the Pixel doesn't match the quality of Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 edge - but the wealth of Google software and the support for things like Google Assistant and Daydream VR help make up for that. "The high price is tough to swallow but on the other hand the Pixel is a worthwhile investment and undoubtedly one of the best smartphones 2016 has produced."

Jeff Allen, senior director of product marketing for Adobe Analytics, told CMSWire Adobe usually provides a spring release for its analytics platform ahead of its yearly digital marketing customer summit.  However, in response to customer feedback, Adobe released improvements ahead of schedule to allow companies to better see activity through digital experiences, check for disengagement points and share data in real-time with colleagues. Competing with SAS, Google Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner has ranked Adobe, SAS and Google the leaders in two successive Magic Quadrant's for Digital Marketing Analytics. Adobe stands slightly behind SAS in Gartner's "ability to execute" category. Each are well ahead of Google in that capacity, but the search giant beats Adobe and SAS in "completeness of vision." Last year, Adobe held the lead over SAS in "ability to execute." Gartner report authors Martin Kihn, Adam Sarner, Andrew Frank, Christi Eubanks and Lizzy Foo Kune praised Adobe Analytics for its innovation and rich functionality, strong marketing cloud integration and segment analysis capabilities. They cautioned over Adobe's complexity, web analytics legacy and certain unfinished marketing cloud product integrations, such as data collection and real-time campaign orchestration. Allen said Adobe's analytics stands ahead of Google's because it provides a holistic view of a customer's journey where Google focuses on advertising metrics. Gartner backed that up in its report this month, saying, Google is "less in tune with marketers seeking a more CRM-oriented approach to analytics." Adobe Analytics is part of the company's eight-tier Adobe Marketing Cloud. It also includes Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Social, Adobe Target, Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Campaign, Media Optimizer and Adobe Primetime. Insights on Conversion, Churn The new capabilities that Adobe Analytics released today include: Flow exploration and fallout analysis. The exploration capability within Analysis Workspace allows brands visualize customer movement through digital experiences, noting data from entry point through to conversion or churn. The "fallout analysis" feature allows users to drag, drop and rearrange steps along the user experience. Where do they disengage? What do they do afterward?  Starter projects. Allen promised a "more natural ramp-up for those trying Analysis Workspace for the first time." Users do not have to be data scientists to leverage insights within the platform, Allen said.  New visualizations. Within line graphs, users can now forecast expected future outcomes or automatically detect data anomalies and run contribution. Users can identify high and low value users. Users can also now compare data year over year, month over month or day over day.  Adobe Analytics includes more than 140,000 active users. It's part of the $1.36 billion Adobe Digital Marketing Cloud. Adobe acquired the Omniture analytics platform in 2009. It includes web and mobile analytics, multi-site grouping, visitor segmentation, action alerts, data sources, cross-category analysis, video measurement and reporting and web 2.0 optimization. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Domo Strikes New Low in Vendor Competition Everything You Thought You Knew About User Experience Is Wrong Kentico’s New Cloud CMS Is Headless, Thoughtful and Affordable NowDiscover Uses Machine Learning in Video Recommendation Engine Domo Strikes New Low in Vendor Competition What You Need to Know About Google Surveys 360 Looker 4.0 Pushes BI Out Programmatically This Secret Formula Will Make You an Analytics Superhero Useful Article?

See that, AWS? We said it 20 Oct 2016 at 14:04, Gavin Clarke Gavin Clarke Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Cloud, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Oracle Recent Articles Ubuntu Core Snaps door shut on Linux's new Dirty COWs Stiff upper lips and sun glasses: the Chancellor bets on Brexit feeling UK will retaliate against state-sponsored cyber attacks, Chancellor warns Gobbling data via S3 is what helped make AWS what it is - the world’s single biggest provider of public cloud. Google, lagging AWS somewhat with GCP, today shook up the data storage options on its cloud coupled with an added price drop to help close that gap. Amazon claims to have reduced AWS prices 52 times since 2006 and still made $2.8bn at last count, representing a revenue rise of 58 per cent. AWS has seen of Microsoft’s puny attempts at price competition fail, and now it is the turn of Google, which at its GCP Next conference in London on Thursday claimed it is the “perennial price leader” in cloud. First, the bits: Google announced new storage classes for hot and cold storage - that’s frequently and hardly accessed data - on GCP for both within regions and across regions. For the latter, Coldline is an archival and disaster recovery option for long-term storage of source files - similar to Amazon’s Glacier. Coldline is priced $0.007 per GB per month with an access fee of $0.05 per GB. Your data might be long term cold, but Google promised to jolt it awake in less than a second. Accompanying Coldline for the hot stuff are new regional and multi-regional storage classes. Multi region is for customers who want to shift their data around the world for availability or back-up with Google - also citing need for firms in media needing to deliver video via CDNs. The service is served in GCP’s three locations - the US, EU and Asia - and priced $0.026 per GB each month but Google will offer “several months” of free storage, for up to 100PB of data. If you’re not multi region you are, by definition, regional and from November 1 all GCP standard storage customers will be converted to the regional bucket and be charged 23 per cent less. The service targets general computing, transcoding and data analytics. Also cut is the price of API operations - for example using JSON for an insert or an update: less than 1,000 operations and Google has cut the price in half, it claimed, to $0.005. For 10,000 operations the price is cut by 60 per cent to $0.004 per transaction. Speaking at GCP Next, head of solutions architecture Miles Ward reckoned Google is the cloud’s perennial leader on price. He claimed a maximum possible discount on GCP pricing of 89 per cent if you went all the way, being “programmatic” using software to finely manage services, instances, containers - the whole lot. Otherwise, an “average” discount of 59 per cent could be calculated employing elements such as AWS rightsizing recommendations, he claimed. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 4 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

News Room SOURCE: uBreakiFix October 20, 2016 10:16 ET uBreakiFix Becomes Exclusive Repair Partner for Google Pixel Phones Across U.S. and Canada ORLANDO, FL--(Marketwired - October 20, 2016) - uBreakiFix is working with Google to provide an exclusive walk-in repair option for their recently launched and highly anticipated Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Boasting features like the best smartphone camera and virtual assistant on the market, it's easy to see why the Wall Street Journal dubbed the Pixel "the android phone you've been waiting for." Consumers can bring their Pixel phones to uBreakiFix stores for repair support. The Pixel is Google's first smartphone where the company designed and engineered all hardware, software and cloud-based service offerings. Coupled with Google Assistant, this phone allows Google's Android operating system to fully take advantage of its hardware, resulting in better performance and experience for consumers. As Google joins the increasingly competitive smartphone market, they want to offer their customers a more convenient repair option. By working with uBreakiFix, Google is giving customers access to manufacturer-backed, same-day repair services that use OEM parts. Customers will not have to wait for appointments to get broken screens fixed, and customers can use the available mail-in service if they are not able to visit any of the 240 retail locations. Google Pixel after-sales service will be available in more than 240 retail locations throughout 187 cities. Each store is equipped with a committed team of specialists who will provide a top-of-the-line experience to customers. "We are pleased to provide Pixel customers with the quality repair service and exceptional customer experience that have come to define our brand," said CEO and founder Justin Wetherill. "A broken device shouldn't have to ruin someone's day." uBreakiFix specializes in same-day repair service of small electronics including mending cracked screens, water damage, software issues, camera issues and most other technical problems in its stores. Stores will be offering special pricing for Google customers, with Pixel screen repairs for $129.99, and Pixel XL screen repairs for $149.99. Customers can also search the uBreakiFix website for their location nearest and mail their devices in for repair. uBreakiFix was founded in 2009 by a savvy millennial duo, Justin Wetherill and David Reiff, who married their skillsets with Eddie Trujillo to offer a brick and mortar alternative tech repair option that was quick, affordable and provided a quality customer experience. By filling a gap in the repair marketplace, the company has grown organically without debt, investors or consultants. With more than 240 stores in operation across North America, uBreakiFix continues to grow and expects to have more than 275 locations by the end of 2016. About uBreakiFix Founded in 2009, uBreakiFix specializes in the repair of small electronics, ranging from smartphones, game consoles, tablets, computers and everything in between.

We just live in it by Virginia Chamlee Oct 20, 2016, 9:36am EDT tweet share pin Google Google hospitality? It's coming, and it will probably be vegetarian. QSR Magazine reports that salad chain Chopt has been testing two “veggie labs” in partnership with Google. The concepts are so far only available on Google campuses in New York and California. But they’ve proven so popular with company employees that it wouldn’t be surprising if the concepts eventually start popping up outside the hallowed halls of the tech giant. One of the concepts, called Relish, began as a temporary project at Google’s California campus in April, and has since become a permanent addition. According to a spokesperson, the kiosk features vegetable preparations like superfood shots (almond milk, chia, pomegranate, goji) and vegetable noodles with cauliflower ceviche. But Relish functions as more than just a place for Google staffers to grab lunch: The Chopt founders think of it as an incubator and a food laboratory. Many of the dishes at Relish inspire ideas at Outside the Box, another Chopt/Google kiosk at Google’s New York campus. Outside The Box opened in late September and rotates four menus, featuring selections like roasted sweet potato boats topped with braised chicken tinga, elote brussels sprouts, and Mexican dressing; and kelp noodles with beet-pickled cauliflower. Chopt founder Tony Shure told Eater via a spokesperson, in a email, “Food trends will come and go but the rise of vegetables is here to stay. Everyone wants to eat more vegetables but they struggle with how to make them fun, convenient, and most importantly, delicious... Working with Google helped us take our mission one step further, pushing us to re-imagine what vegetable eating can and should be in the future.” The result of the effort, he adds, “has been a huge home-run.” So does that mean the concept might expand beyond Google? “Although Outside the Box is only open to Googlers in NYC at present, you never know what the future may hold,” says Shure. If any of the Chopt/Google concepts were to expand outside of Google world, they’d face stiff competition. Fast-casual vegetarian options abound at chains like Sweetgreen, and the José Andrés’-helmed (and Gwyneth Paltrow-backed) Beefsteak. Google isn’t even the only one with a tech background in the space. Kimbal Musk (Elon’s brother) will soon open a $5-and-under, vegetable-centric concept in Memphis. Google employees have long had a wealth of food choices, even before Relish and Outside the Box came along. Employees at the Mountain View, Calif. headquarters can even snag free lunch from a battalion of 20 food trucks (all new concepts) parked on campus.

Skilled pilots can dip the basket of their balloons into the water and then soar away again into the sky. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) LOS ANGELES — USA TODAY Network debuted a first-of-its kind weekly virtual reality news show Thursday, inviting viewers to soar in 360-degrees at a hot-air balloon festival in New Mexico and to join high-liners above Arizona's canyons. Called “VRtually There” and co-produced with YouTube, the show's initial content is targeted towards action, along the lines of what's been shown on the USA TODAY YouTube channel in 360°, including flying with the Blue Angels and getting into the pit during the Indianapolis 500 race. In the new show's debut, viewers also can jump into the cockpit of an F-18 and take off. Ex-National Geographic producer David Hamlin will serve as executive producer. Thrill seekers go "highlining" in the Arizona desert on the USA TODAY Network "VRtually There" 360 show.  (Photo: USA TODAY) "VRtually" will be available on USA TODAY’s mobile app (iOS | Android), as well as its VR Stories app (iOS | Android), and YouTube, which has exclusivity for the first 60 days from each episode’s release. It will also work for desktop computer users and with phone-based VR viewer Google Cardboard and upcoming Google Daydream headset viewer. The production is one of several breaking ground in VR, a category that has its roots in gaming but that's branching out into other content, including news. These offer a 360-degree look at the world — up, down, left and right — with a swipe on mobile phones. More immersive experiences use headsets like the Samsung Gear, which connects to Galaxy phones, or Facebook's Oculus Rift, a specialized headset tethered to a powerful computer. Most folks watch 360° on Facebook and YouTube's mobile 360° channel without a viewer, which “is cool,” says Niko Chauls, director of applied technology for Gannett, the parent company of the USA TODAY Network, the publisher of this report. Add the viewer and “it’s a mind blowing, dazzling experience.” Vrtually There, a new 360 show from the USA TODAY Network  (Photo: USA TODAY) USA TODAY is not alone in exploring VR for news purposes. The Huffington Post and VR studio RYOT also have a ten-part “The Big Picture: News in Virtual Reality,” planned for the Hulu VR app in November, to be viewed on the new Google Daydream and the Samsung Gear VR virtual reality viewers. This year, VR drew closer to the mainstream as Facebook opened up the ability to view VR videos in the News Feed, and YouTube launched a dedicated 360° channel. The YouTube channel includes videos from media partners Showtime, Fox, GoPro, Sony, Warner Bros. and Red Bull. Toyota has signed as the first sponsor for "VRtually There" with a "cubemercial," a 360° ad produced for Toyota's Camry car that whisks the reviewer to Australia's wilderness. “VRtually There” is  produced by journalists at the 110 members of the Network, including USA TODAY and sister publications like the Arizona Republic, Des Moines Register and Indianapolis Star. New episodes will post Thursdays at 2 p.m. ET, with three segments lasting around 5 minutes. 0:00|7:21 This is a 360° video experience.

USA TODAY NETWORK “Our in-house VR content production is unique to the industry, allows us to showcase our great journalism across the NETWORK and allows us to expose our vast audience to this innovative storytelling,” said Joanne Lipman, USA TODAY NETWORK’s chief content officer, in a statement. With companies like Google, Samsung, Facebook, HTC, Sony and Microsoft investing in virtual reality, it made sense for Gannett to be there as well, notes Kevin Gentzel, chief revenue officer for Gannett. "That's a big tailwind," showing that VR is real, he adds. While the show is weekly now, Chauls wants to increase to a daily broadcast. The hurdle is production. The show is shot on multiple cameras which have to be "stitched" together in software, and that can take a lot of time. New automated software from companies like Google promise to greatly cut down on the time it takes to stitch, he adds. "This is the time to build the audience, get them used to the medium and what’s possible," he says.

This was 'outed' in the Google Webmaster Help forums where Miguel Borges-Porteous said he received an unsolicited email from a "Google SIMux employee" asking him to join. He wrote: Recently received an email message from a supposed Google SIMux employee, with an @google.com email address notifying of an opportunity to be part of a Google Search Console Advisory Board that is soliciting industry feedback for design improvements. Needless to say, this would be rewarding to participate in, but a number of peculiarities stand out: The sign up link goes to a google forms document (which could theoretically be put up by anyone) The link uses google's link shortner goo.gl Form links to privacy policy and usability studies faq on google.com, but the form itself is not on google.com He asked, is this a scam and the answer is no. John Mueller from Google responded, "yes, this is legitimate." He added that this "went to a small, hand-picked group of Search Console users." If you are nervous, he said "one way to double-check the form is to look for the "This form was created inside of Google.com." in the footer. If you're interested, we'd love to be able to get your feedback on some of the ideas." Forum discussion at Google Webmaster Help.

The new tag has been rolled out in the US and UK for now, with the company looking to expand the same for other countries soon. “Google News determines whether an article might contain fact checks in part by looking for the schema.org ClaimReview markup,” Gingras said. He added that Google also looks for sites that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks. “Publishers who create fact-checks and would like to see it appear with the “Fact check” tag should use that markup in fact-check articles,” Gingras added. Looks like Google rolled out the new ‘Fact check’ tag, keeping in mind next month’s US Presidential elections. Google recently rolled out Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) for mobile search results in India. Google says AMP pages will show pages that are ready to load quickly without affecting search rankings for pages and websites. Google’s AMP project was announced last year, and there are over 600 million AMP documents that have been created in over 104 languages across the world. In India, publishers like Zomato, NDTV, as well Indian Express Group are all using AMP. India is the second biggest market for Google and it is no surprise the search giant is trying to create products tailored for the country’s slow networks. However, it is unclear at this moment when ‘Fact check’ tag will be rolled out for India.

Feel better now? Some of today’s key news: Donald Trump was booed for calling Clinton ‘corrupt’ as the normally bipartisan Alfred E Smith Catholic fundrasing dinner turned sour. Traditionally an opportunity for self-deprecating jabs, the dinner instead took on a snarlier tone, with the Republican candidate calling his rival corrupt and accusing her of “pretending not to hate Catholics”. Trump scored a hit, though, with a gag about his wife’s partly plagiarised speech during the Republican National Convention in July: Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it’s fantastic. My wife Melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case. I don’t get it. With a nod to his assertion during this week’s debate that Clinton was “such a nasty woman”, Trump shrugged: This stuff is all relative. After listening to Hillary rattle on and on and on, I don’t think so badly of Rosie O’Donnell any more. In fact I’m actually starting to like Rosie a lot. Clinton had some barbs of her own in a speech that was, however, more willing to poke fun at herself and her “rigorous nap schedule”. On Trump’s reluctance to reveal detailed health records, she mocked: Donald Trump really is as healthy as a horse – you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on. And on the thorny issue of Trump’s attitude to women, Clinton remarked: Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four – maybe a five, if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair. Elsewhere Trump’s national political director Jim Murphy is “stepping back” from the campaign, with less than three weeks to go until 8 November. “I have not resigned but for personal reasons have had to take a step back from the campaign,” Murphy said in a statement to Politico. Trump says he will accept US election result “if I win”. Jeff Bezos says Donald Trump’s behavior “erodes democracy”. Trump loyalists plan own exit poll amid claims of ‘rigged’ election. And the Republican nominee was accused of sexual misconduct by a 10th woman. The live blog is back tomorrow for more … whatever happens. Thanks for reading and for your comments.

In her six campaign trail speeches for Hillary Clinton, the first lady has never said the Republican nominee’s name. She’s talked about “this candidate” and dedicated much of her time to a searing indictment of his words and positions. But throughout her buzzworthy takedowns, Trump remains the man who shall remain nameless.

October 21, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.44pm EDT 22:44 Sabrina Siddiqui If Donald Trump’s campaign has been defined by going where no candidate has gone before, on Thursday the real estate mogul added a new feather to his cap: being roundly booed at a Catholic charity dinner. The Republican nominee encountered a chilly reception at the Alfred E. Smith dinner, an annual Catholic fundraiser in New York City, with Hillary Clinton also in attendance. Presidential candidates have long graced the white-tie affair and roasted themselves while throwing in a few jabs at their opponents. But after earning a few laughs, Trump’s remarks quickly devolved into a stinging indictment of Clinton that prompted jeers from the audience. “Hillary believes it’s vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private,” Trump said, nodding to the emails of her campaign chairman John Podesta that were published by WikiLeaks. “That’s OK,” Trump responded to the audible boos that followed. “I don’t know who they’re angry at, Hillary, you or I?” “You!” a voice cried out from the crowd. Trump pressed on, standing at a podium mere feet away from Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who served as the evening’s host: “For example, here she is tonight in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.” Trump did bring the house down with a rejoinder poking fun at his wife’s dabble with plagiarism during the Republican National Convention in July. “Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it, it’s fantastic,” Trump said. “My wife Melania gives the exact same speech, and people get on her case. I don’t get it.” But the barbs he subsequently threw at Clinton, delivered as though the venue was a Trump campaign rally, fell flat. Clinton’s speech, albeit less bitter in its tone, was similarly crafted with a series of jokes not far removed from the attack lines she has employed against Trump on the stump. The Democratic nominee needled her opponent over his admiration for Russia, remarking of Trump’s refusal to disclose his health records: “Donald Trump really is as healthy as a horse – you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.” Of his inability to stick to teleprompters, Clinton quipped: “I’m sure it’s even harder when you’re translating from the original Russian.” The former secretary of state also homed in on his behavior toward women. “Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four, maybe a five, if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair. “You know what would be a good number for a woman? 45,” she added, in reference to the number marking the next president’s place in US history.

(Benoit Tessier/Reuters) Autonomous Vehicles Google, auto makers object to California rules for self-driving cars Add to ... David Shepardson Reuters Published Thursday, Oct. 20, 2016 9:30AM EDT Last updated Thursday, Oct. 20, 2016 9:38AM EDT Comments AA Alphabet Inc’s Google unit and auto makers objected on Wednesday to California proposals to set new, mandatory rules for testing self-driving cars in the state, which industry officials said could hobble their efforts in the home to much of self-driving vehicle testing and development. Auto makers and Google raised a litany of concerns about California’s proposal at a hearing in Sacramento on Wednesday. They expressed opposition to the state proposal to require compliance with guidelines that federal regulators issued last month, but made voluntary. They questioned why California would require a new autonomous vehicle data recorder and what data they would be required to test, and they objected to a proposal they said would force a 12-month delay between testing a vehicle and deploying it on public roads. Auto makers also questioned whether police should be able to get any self-driving data within 24 hours without seeking a warrant or subpoena. California regulatory policy is important to auto makers and technology companies because of its impact on operations in the state, and because the policies enacted in the most populous U.S. state often influence what other states and other countries do. The proposed requirement that manufacturers generate a year of driverless testing data before applying for an operating permit drew objections from General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG, Honda Motor Co, Ford Motor Co, and Google. The state’s approach “could greatly delay the benefits that self-driving vehicles can bring to safety and mobility for individuals,” said David Strickland, who heads the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets that includes Google, Ford, Lyft, Uber Technologies Inc and Volvo Car Group. Brian Soublet, deputy director of the California DMV, said Wednesday the department wants concrete suggestions to help improve its proposal. Soublet said the department will be considering potential changes over the next several months but he did not give a timetable for finalizing the rules. “The goal is making sure that we can get this life-saving technology out on the streets,” Soublet said. California’s proposal would allow for the absence of a human driver and a steering wheel in advanced self-driving cars. In December, California had proposed to require licensed drivers and controls in self-driving vehicles. Ron Medford, director of safety for Google’s self-driving car project, said California’s proposal to require manufacturers to obtain local approval is “unworkable.” The rule could prevent manufacturers from testing a vehicle that can travel from one area to another. Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog urged California to prohibit autonomous vehicles without a human driver until federal regulators enact enforceable standards.

That’s the take-away from Google’s recent spate of hardware products, easily seen with its new Pixel, available for sale on Thursday. It’s the first phone the company has designed from the ground up, and the search-engine giant has taken a page from Apple’s book. The Pixel is really good as an Android smartphone, and great as a showcase for Google’s software, and what can happen when the company tries to optimize both to work together. And along with other products the company announced a few weeks back, such as Google Home — a smart speaker that can answer queries and play music — and Google Wifi — a new modular router system — Google wants you to buy into its ecosystem, and stay for a while. Apple’s strategy has always been that walled garden, the closed-off operating system and series of products that work well together. Google, meanwhile, focused on software, and was the much more open competitor. That approach worked well for the company; Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the world, and Google works with many partners, offering a huge variety of products. The problem is that the open approach has led to fragmentation. While the latest versions of Android are slick operating systems, how the software upgrades depends on your device, and is often left up to the carriers. With the Pixel — similar to Google’s Nexus line — users are promised that they will get software upgrades when Google provides them. The phone itself is a showcase device designed to take on the premium players out there, the iPhone in particular. A perfect example of that approach is an included adapter that makes it quick and easy to switch over from an iPhone; that works well, but the fact that the adaptor is included in every box shows that Google truly hopes people will make the move. The Pixel is also in the same price range as the iPhone, with the 32GB version starting at $899 and the XL 32GB starting at $1,049. (In Canada, Apple’s 32 GB iPhone 7 starts at $899, while the iPhone 7 Plus 32GB is $1,049. At this point, though, most people have made their decisions between Apple and Android, and their preference is likely about more than just the phone. It’s about the other stuff they bought to work nicely with that phone. It’s the ecosystem. If you care about apps, Apple still wins, while Google hopes that its artificial intelligence expertise — and using the all the data it has gathered about you to help its personal Assistant — will be the differentiator that keeps you there. Google CEO Sundar Pichai pitched this concept as the beginning of creating a “personal Google” for each person. At this point, Assistant feels slightly smarter than Apple’s Siri, and there were a couple of cool moments with Google’s helper: it can quickly answer queries from the web, recognize and offer to automatically schedule events, and give a handy daily briefing. Some services like OpenTable work with Assistant, but others like Uber don’t yet. There are times when it can get frustrating, but it’s still early days. Google’s plan has been about using what it learns about you, and acting on it. That used to mean serving up ads based on your search queries. Now, by getting serious about hardware, including the new devices like the smart speaker, they can be everywhere that you are. It’s a step toward the idea of pervasive computing, where no matter the device, the benefits of technology are available all around us. For Google, that’s a plan that starts with the Pixel. Pixel XL Review Design decisions: It looks a bit like an iPhone, although it has straight edges on the side, making it easier to grip than Apple’s curved design. There are no buttons on the front, and there’s a fingerprint scanner on the back, copying something that LG phones have been had. It feels like a premium phone but, other than a back panel, nothing stands out. Samsung still wins on design. The basics: The three most important things in a phone are the screen, the camera and the battery. All three are very good here. The long-lasting battery got me through two business days, and the quick-charging works very well. It has a gorgeous 5.5-inch screen. The camera is very good, with great video stabilization, although to me the iPhone 7 Plus is slightly better. Google’s services: I like Google Assistant and am still testing its capabilities. There are great automated moments, and it is very good at search and web queries. I also like Google’s Duo, the FaceTime competitor that also works across Android and iOS. And if you use Google Photos, the cloud-based service backs up your pictures, you can think about getting the smaller 32 GB version. The switch-over: iPhone users can quickly switch over email accounts, text message and photos simply by plugging in an adapter to the Pixel. It was surprised at how well it worked. Now if there was a way for the apps you bought on one platform to cross the divide. A few knocks: There are really only two issues with this phone. First, it is lacking in water resistance, which has become fairly standard on premium devices. And it is expensive. But it is still an excellent phone that deserves a spot at the table near its premium phones competitors.

Google plans to launch an online subscription TV services through YouTube. (“YouTube logo” image by “korosirego” on flickr CC BY SA 2.0) TheirTube Google plans to launch an online TV service early next year, and the company seems to be wrapping up deals with a number of major content providers. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday Google has already signed on CBS, and is in advanced talks with 21st Century Fox and Disney. Reuters reported Viacom is also in talks with Google to provide content beyond the CBS brand. Reuters says the content will be offered as a subscription service through YouTube, for $30 to $40 per month. Post-Depression bigotry NPR blogs about a new online tool to explore your city’s history of housing discrimination. The tool offers interactive, historical maps that show the effects of “redlining” on certain neighborhoods. The practice of redlining determined where people would be able to get home loans backed by the federal government in the 1930s and 1940s. The areas where homeowners encountered the most barriers to getting loans were disproportionately black neighborhoods. If you click through the link, you can zoom in on the maps to see the exact neighborhoods in 150 U.S. cities where this discrimination happened. Don’t blame the robots What is the deal with American manufacturing? Factories have shed hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide, but productivity has soared. The Washington Post published a Q & A with two smart economists to untangle the story of what’s actually going on. It turns out, we can’t blame robots for all the job losses. But the globalization explanation needs some fine tuning as well. Watching for water Snow isn’t falling in the Sierra Nevada mountains like it used to, and that’s really bad news for California’s water supply. New Scientist has a look at how the state is deploying new technology to better manage that supply. SierraNet will cover the mountains with a network of sensors that give precise measurements of how much precipitation is actually up there, waiting to wash down into the state’s reservoirs. By measuring the water while it’s still snow, state officials are hoping they’ll be able to more accurately project how much water the reservoirs will have in the months ahead, which directly affects hydroelectric power—and how much Californians pay for electricity. must read money stories Search Our Site Search for: Subscribe to Our Podcast     Latest News Reporters and Data: 5 Questions for Brandon Quester Share this!Brandon Quester is the founder and executive director of November 14, 2016 Must Read Money Stories for Monday, Nov. 14 Share this!Who benefits from Trump’s new tax plan On the November 14, 2016 Donald W.

Bethany Nauert If you’re going to live, work or hang out in a planned community, you could do a lot worse than L.A.’s Playa Vista. For those who care about technology, the Westside development is turning into the nerve center of Silicon Beach. Facebook, Electronic Arts, YouTube, IMAX, Fox Interactive Media, numerous digital agencies and whatever Yahoo is now are here. But the biggest news, of course, is that Google has purchased 12 acres of Playa Vista land for its new campus. One can only imagine the drone food delivery and smart buses that could be here in the not-so-distant future. For those who have a family, the on-site security, school, playgrounds, concerts and walkability of Playa Vista are ultra-appealing. This is a place where you can let your children stroll alone safely, an area where they’ll actually want to play outside much of the day. And with all these innovative businesses and an influx of residents, Playa Vista has gotten new amenities, of course, including a so-on-trend Whole Foods with a bar that serves cocktails and poke, and a seafood counter that sells poke, and a ramen and poke cart. The best poke you’ll find in the neighborhood, though, is at Top Chef runner-up Brooke Williamson’s new Da Kikokiko, a bright, cheery, colorful Hawaiian-inspired wonderland that opened on October 14. It’s part of the popular restaurant collection at Runway Playa Vista, a dining/shopping/entertainment complex that buzzes day and night and also includes the Whole Foods, soup-dumpling slinger ROC, Hopdoddy Burger Bar, Baja-inspired Sol Cocina, plant-based and modern-cafeteria cuisine, a forthcoming 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria, yupster-friendly fitness studios, boutique clothing stores, a CVS and a movie theater. It’s pretty fantastic that an L.A. beach day can mean stopping for a plate of pork belly and bits after going for a dip. Runway is built to service the growing neighborhood around it, but Williamson and husband/business partner Nick Roberts could have a fast-casual destination restaurant on their hands with smartly constructed signature poke bowls like hamachi, lilikoi ponzu, pickled ginger, cucumber, scallion, Maui onion, cilantro, radish sprouts, toasted garlic and yuzu tobiko. We recommend trying this over a grain blend with quinoa and brown rice. You can also build your own bowl with options including yellowfin tuna, lomi-lomi salmon, octopus and Japanese eggplant, and more than 30 toppings like avocado, kimchi, fresh grated wasabi, shaved serrano pepper and jellyfish salad. There’s also musubi including the requisite spam along with yuzu kosho salmon, sesame miso zucchini and teriyaki chicken. Turns out you can do a lot cooking with just a panini press if you get creative. For something sweet, there’s shaved iced featuring flavors (like matcha, coconut and pineapple) that have little in common with the artificial, bizarrely colored options you might have encountered elsewhere. Order a scoop of ice cream and they’ll bury it at the bottom of your shaved ice as motivation to finish your entire dessert. Williamson and Roberts also have a restaurant empire in neighboring Playa Del Rey, where they operate gastropub The Tripel and the multiple-concepts-under-one-roof Playa Provisions. Playa Provisions is a breakfast and sandwich shop, an ice-cream counter, a destination seafood restaurant and a back-room whisky bar (inspired by speakeasy-style drinking dens like New York’s PDT) all at one address. It’s a fun place where, as I’ve noted before, you can take your family during the day and hide from your kids at night. Williamson isn’t the only star chef, uh, shoring up Playa Del Rey’s dining scene. Perry Cheung, a winner of the Esquire Network’s Knife Fight, has his ASAP Phorage bahn mi and pho counter tucked in the back of Gordon’s Market. It’s pretty fantastic that an L.A. beach day can mean stopping here for a plate of pork belly and bits after going for a dip. By the way, when we visited ASAP Phorage recently, the special of the day was poke.

Game Based and Industrial End-To-End Process IoT Augmented Reality Modular AR markets Are Anticipated to Reach $7 Trillion by 2027 Worldwide AR markets are poised to achieve significant growth with the use of smartphone apps and headsets or glasses that are platforms to project digital information as images onto a game image or a work situation. AR digital enhancement provides explanations and process predictions. Google pointed the way, as it so often does, to the AR opportunity with Google glass which failed, but spawned a large number of projects that have succeeded. All the AR vendors will reap the benefits of the Google original Google Glass huge AR marketing investment. Augmented reality AR is set to become an indispensable part of people's lives. AR is poised to take off as part of the much heralded Internet of things (IoT). Digital images become as much a part of the real world as the things we can touch and feel as they are integrated into everyday life. The reality is augmented by the digital images. Augmented reality is a misnomer to the extent that it implies that reality is somehow has something superimposed on it. Instead the reality exists, and the digital images blend in to enhance the experience of reality, make it more understandable or more interesting. The reality is not changed, it is not made better, it is understood better. Use-cases for AR proliferate. Pokemon Go points the way to, illustrates, the huge game market opportunity looming on the ubiquitous smart phones. Adoption of AR technology in the enterprise is growing. AR headsets and glasses are used in manufacturing, logistics, remote service, retail, medical, and education. One popular AR application is providing see-what-I-see' functionality, enabling off-site specialists to provide real-time guidance and expertise to troubleshoot an issue. Others superimpose process steps by step information on dials and switches in workflow situations. Key Topics Covered: 1.

This was what the Nexus range was all about. But this lead to at least a few compromises.  With the arrival of Daydream VR, and with so many hardware makers falling on financial hard times, Google couldn't afford any compromises. The Pixel is the company's first home-made smartphone. It offers the latest version of Android, with a few Pixel-specific features, and support for the as-yet-unreleased VR system. Google Pixel Review: Design The Pixel may not have been technically built by Google, but neither is the iPhone technically built by Apple. It's commonplace to have another company building the actual hardware. For the Pixel, Google chose HTC, a company which has seen its own-brand devices slump in popularity over recent years. But here's the good part: HTC knows how to build really good phones. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: When and where can I get them? Think back to the Nexus One, undoubtedly one of the best-made Nexus phones released. It was built by HTC. More recently, the HTC One Series, ranging from the M7 to M9, all drew plaudits for their industrial design. In short: Google couldn't have picked a better hardware manufacturer. And it shows in the device. Everything about the exterior design and manufacturing feels deliberate, purposeful and precise. Whether you're looking at the textured power button, the Type-C port and flanking cutouts for the mic and speaker, the 3.5mm jack or the weird glass panel on the back, it's all exact. Pocket-lint Then there's the soft bead-blasted metal finish on the back which rounds really nicely towards the perfectly flat edges and the large angle chamfers. All of it is so well finished and designed, it's impossible to ignore. We're not particularly fond of the unusual-looking glass panel on the back, which hosts the camera, sensors, dual-tone LED flash and circular fingerprint sensor. But we get it. In an era where so many smartphones look the same, it's nice to have something different, something that says "this is the Pixel phone". With that, and the single "G" stamped on the back, it's recognisable as a device all of its own. Google Pixel tips: First things to do with your new Google superphone One element that's difficult to get used to is the position of the volume and power buttons. Most phones tend to have the power button lowest, whereas Google opted to put the power button above the volume switch. That means it's easy to accidentally turn volume down, rather than send the phone to sleep. Pocket-lint All these perks and quirks are packed in to a phone which fits really nicely in the hand, feels durable, and has a heft of class without being too heavy. Google Pixel Review: Display With the Pixel being the smaller of the two new Google phones, the 5-inch screen features fewer pixels than its big brother, the Pixel XL. While the larger model has a Quad HD screen, the Pixel has a Full HD panel. Still, 1080 x 1920 pixels shoved into a display that's only 5-inches diagonally makes for a very sharp screen. At 441 pixels per inch, everything is crisp. It is AMOLED too, and comes with all the benefits and drawbacks of choosing that over LCD. Specifically, colours are vibrant, contrast is high and blacks are deep. That means it's fantastic for watching movies, gaming, or viewing anything with lots of colour. Pocket-lint It does mean that whites aren't quite as pure as they would be on a good LCD panel - they come across as ever so slightly warm, but you're unlikely to notice unless you have it side-by-side with an iPhone or other device. On the whole, the Pixel's display is one of the nicest we've seen on a phone at this scale. The panel itself is so close to the glass surface that viewing angles are superb, and content almost appears as if it's on the surface. Google Pixel Review: Software The Google Pixel comes with the brand new version of Android Nougat. But you can take what you know about 7.0 Nougat and throw it away, because the Pixel Launcher and software are considerably different to the software we've been using since the first Nexus developer preview went live a few months ago. Pocket-lint First up is Google Assistant, the voice controlled assistant. It is, essentially, Google Now packaged in to a more human, chat-like user interface. It has many of the same functions you're used to - like telling you the weather, knowing your calendar events, setting reminders, sports scores and much more - but packaged in to an interface that's more intuitive. Part of the setup process - when first powering up the phone - is training it to recognise your voice, the same way Google Now does when you want the "Ok Google" command to wake it up when it's dormant. You can also launch it by tapping and holding the virtual home button. Now, instead of launching a Google Search interface, the command launches a chat thread, similar to Google Allo, the company's messaging app, in the bottom half of the screen which then expands once a question has been posed.  Pocket-lint The beauty of Google Assistant is that it keeps learning. As time goes by, and you use it more, its predictive reply suggestions are more tailored to the kinds of things you would ask or say. Like Google Allo, these appear as individual bubbles underneath the most recent response from Google.  Unlike every version of Android so far, there's no app drawer button. The familiar dotted circle icon has been replaced by an app drawer that simply drags up from the bottom of the home screen. While the gesture feels more intuitive, the biggest benefit of this is that it allows you to have a fifth app icon pinned to the dock. Google Pixel tips and tricks: Getting to grips with Google's phone The app icons themselves have been given a new feature too. Similar to the iPhone, you can bring up app shortcuts for some of the default Android apps like Messenger, Calendar, Camera and Dialler. Because there's no pressure sensitive screen, you bring these up by long-pressing the app.  Another new addition in the Pixel launcher is the wallpaper picker, which now has a vast collection of default wallpapers, including some breathtaking landscapes and cityscapes from professional photographers, as well as Google's own live wallpapers. Some of these react and change colour to match the time and the weather, others are just Google Earth images that move slowly and react as you swipe through home screen spaces.  Pocket-lint All the default app icons are now round, as are the folder windows, and you can quick-reply to notifications without leaving the app you're in, or from the lock screen. But, apart from those design changes and features, there are some real benefits to having a Pixel phone over another Android smartphone.  Firstly, the Google Photos app allows you backup all of your photos in full size, original resolution, for free. Normally, on other Android phones or iPhone, you only get free unlimited backup space if you choose to reduce the quality. What's more, there's no time limit on the offer. As long as you have the Pixel phone, you get full resolution backups.  Secondly, the Settings app has a second tab giving you quick, easy access to a support team. You can call them or start a text-based chat with them as they help you through any issues you're having.  Pocket-lint Apart from those features, the software is otherwise Android 7.1 Nougat as we know it. That includes the split-screen multitasking mode, which seems a little wasted on a 5-inch screen. Although it is still useful for those odd moments when you need to reference a video, map position, or quote while typing an email or message.  Easy access to your battery performance from the drop-down menu - which, by the way, you can access now by swiping down on the Pixel Imprint sensor on the back - is a much welcome addition, as is the ability to add, remove and rearrange quick settings tiles.  Google Pixel Review: Performance One of the benefits of creating its own phone, is that the Google software can be fine-tuned to run like a charm on the hardware. With its clean, stock Android experience, there's no bloat or additional software to get in the way. That means everything is very snappy and smooth in operation. In fact, we'd go as far as saying it's the most responsive Android phone we've ever used. Pocket-lint While a big part of that is the new lightweight software experience, it's also down to the efficient and powerful Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor and 4GB RAM that's on board. Game animations are stutter-free and smooth, while load times are as quick as you'd hope for from a flagship phone. It may not get the highest benchmark scores we've seen during tests, but it still runs like a dream - and that, ultimately, is what matters most. There's the option for 32 or 128GB of storage and as anyone who owned a Nexus will tell you, there's no provision for microSD card expansion here. That's a downside compared to many flagship Android phones. Sure, Apple has never offered expandable storage and that works for iPhone; Android does and in this new competitive "phone by Google" world, customers will expect such features. Google Pixel Review: Battery Life On paper, the 2,770mAh battery may not seem like it would be capacious enough to offer great battery life, but that's where numbers on paper can deceive. There are a couple of things worth taking in to consideration that ensure the Pixel's battery lasts well beyond a full day of regular use. First is thanks again to that software. Like Android Marshmallow before it, Android 7 Nougat has Google Doze. This essentially means that when the phone is put down on a surface and in standby, any excessive background processes are killed. This ensures there's little battery usage when the phone isn't in use, like when you're asleep. Unlike Marshmallow, Nougat's Doze mode is also active when the phone is in your pocket, or in your hand. It doesn't have to be lying still on a flat surface. In short: if your phone isn't being used, your battery isn't either. Pocket-lint With light use, our Pixel got from 07:30 to 18:00 with 60 per cent of its capacity left. For light users, this Pixel phone could even be a two day phone. Most days, we got to bed time with between 30-40 per cent charge remaining. That was after spending most of the evening testing the phone's performance (AKA playing hours of Temple Run 2). For heavy users, we suspect the Pixel would still get you to the end of a work day comfortably. Regardless of how long it lasts any specific user, the phone still charges really quickly, thanks to its Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support. Google claims you can get seven hours worth of battery juice from plugging it in for just 15 minutes. Our experience says you should be able to fully charge it in little over an hour. Google Pixel Review: Camera Google claims its camera is among the best out there, pointing to the often-cited DxOMark mobile scores to prove to us all that it's the best camera on a smartphone to date. In our experience, it is good, but it's far from perfect. Pocket-lint One of its early flaws - which could presumably fixed with a software update - is its tendency to get the white balance wrong. In some photos, it applies a white balance as if lightning is incredibly cool, and overcompensates by making the scene more yellow. Almost as if an orange filter has been placed on the outside of the lens. We found this happened on both the front and rear facing camera. With that said, it is capable of producing some really great shots. Even without manual controls - which we've come to expect from top Android phones - it can create photographs with great colour and detail. Perhaps more impressive is that it captures them very quickly. There's almost zero waiting time between hitting the shutter button and the shot being captured. One element which surprised us was how well it coped in low-light situations. Even without manual exposure settings, and with the flash switched off, it can shoot sharp, blur-free images with great colour quality. Pocket-lint It sometimes has trouble focusing on objects close-up, so macro shots are hit and miss. With instances like this, and with the white balance issues, we can't help but feel a manual or "pro" mode with customisable ISO, shutter speed, white balance and focus would be hugely beneficial. But that's not the Pixel's focus: it's all about simplicity. Verdict The Google Pixel is the best Android experience available right now. For the first time we get to see exactly what Google has in mind for hardware design and features. Google is completely in control, and you can tell. Everything is tight, refined and polished to a degree we've never seen in a Nexus phone. Of course, this year, the Pixel arrives without the usual Nexus cheaper-than-flagship price. Indeed, the Pixel costs as much as an iPhone - and that could potentially come back to bite Google. On the other hand, with Samsung's reputation needing some serious work given Note 7 issues, the more-expensive-than-usual Android phone couldn't have come at a better time for Google. If you're after a 5-inch Android smartphone then there's simply nothing else on the market that compares to the Pixel. And because it's a Pixel, made by Google, you'll get prompt software updates, regularly, promptly and for at least a few years. You're not at the whim of a hardware manufacturer or a network operator.

It has nothing to do with Pokemon Go or custom photo filters, nor does it rely on a new console or platform. During New York’s Advertising Week, both companies announced new offerings in the realm of cross-device, with Google focusing on targeting and Facebook adding new reporting capabilities. So what’s all this fuss about cross-device? In 2014, Facebook commissioned a study that found that 53 percent of people who own two devices and 77 percent who own three devices switch between them to complete tasks or activities. Similarly, a Google study from 2012 found that 90 percent of consumers use multiple screens sequentially to accomplish a task, including 67 percent of consumers who switch devices while online shopping. Between product research, entertainment, email, maps, social media and more, consumers’ content consumption habits are absolutely occurring across devices. In other words, this “next big thing” has been staring these companies in the face for years. So why are Facebook and Google just now getting serious about cross-device when these studies confirmed the trend years ago? Because brands and agencies are getting more serious about it. What cross-device means today As the capabilities of our smartphones get more and more advanced, the screens get larger, the mobile web gets optimized and the application economy matures, consumers are increasingly leading mobile-first lifestyles. But while consumers may be mobile-first, brands, agencies and marketers from every industry and vertical realize that consumers aren’t mobile-only. Enter cross-device intelligence. Consumers are constantly switching devices, if not using multiple devices at once. Most of us are probably guilty of checking something on our phones while trying to get some work done on the laptop with the TV on in the background. For marketers, understanding that smartphone A, tablet B, computer C, smartwatch D and smart TV E belong to the same consumer is essential. Not only can they deliver more relevant ads, but they can start to understand the consumer journey across devices and attribute purchases made on desktop to ads shown on mobile, for example. Marketing automation, custom content, product recommendations–all sorts of online customer experience applications can become more personalized with an understanding of consumers’ cross-device identity. In addition, reaching consumers becomes more efficient. It’s possible to reach people when they are more likely to engage with a brand and, in terms of advertising, when they are more receptive to offers and likely to convert. Cross-device identity data helps automated marketing and digital advertising be much smarter because it’s not just what devices people own, but who they are (demographics), what they do (interests) and where they do things (location). Where cross-device is going Cross-device identity has already changed the way marketers think about and plan their digital budgets and how they approach targeting and measurement. And while digital is a large part of overall advertising plans, there’s another large piece of the pie that’s still largely ignored, even by Facebook’s and Google’s new offerings. eMarketer predicts that 2016 will be the year that spending on digital ads overtakes TV spend in the U.S. But while digital and cross-device measurement have largely been solved, TV is stuck in the past. Panels and surveys are the de facto measurement tactics: Did you know that Nielsen Families still exist and, at least in some cases, still uses paper journals? (Side note: Can you imagine if digital measurement worked the way TV does? Where a random selection of consumers had to self-report in physical diaries on the websites they visited and mobile games they played, and at what time of day and locations?) So while Facebook and Google are certainly helping the notion of cross-device identity have its moment, as an industry, there’s still work to be done. TV is still a major “device” that’s missing, and it’s hard to say that any marketer is getting an all-inclusive picture of consumers’ media time without that piece of the puzzle. That said, “cord-cutting” is increasing. The problem marketers face when it comes to targeting and measuring linear TV is that audiences are diminishing since smart TVs and streaming devices are digitally addressable, although Google and Facebook will have a limited view into this channel. Traditional linear TV is hardly an “emerging device,” but with marketers striving to understand consumers holistically, someday soon the targeted reach and detailed measurement capabilities of digital ads will extend into this world and deliver the silver bullet that marketers crave. In the meantime, with Google and Facebook entering the cross-device fray and a number of independent technology companies focusing on identity solutions for the past few years, brands, agencies and enterprises need to be thinking cross-device now more than ever. The days of siloed marketing channels are quickly coming to an end. Rahul Bafna is vice president of product management and partnerships at cross-device programmatic platform provider Drawbridge.

This checklist will bring together a lot of already published content from the site in one place, and there will be links to more detailed guides throughout. It’s also worth reading our guides on How to test a website before launch and SEO essentials for optimising your site for further information. Sign up to Google Search Console Search Console is where you can monitor your site’s performance, identify issues and monitor backlinks. This is also where Google will communicate with you should anything go wrong. Here are the key things you should set-up and regularly check in Search Console: Set your preferred domain: whether your site shows up in search results with the www prefix or without it. HTML improvements: this is where Search Console will recommend any improvements to your meta descriptions and title tags, as well as informing you of any non-indexable content. Links to your site: here you can see the domains that link to your site and its content the most, as well as your most linked webpages. Manual actions: Google will inform you if it has administered a manual action to your site or specific webpage. International targeting: make sure you’re targeting your preferred audience based on language and country. Index status: this lets you know how many pages of your website are currently included in Google’s index. You can quickly see any worrying trends, as well as any pages that have been blocked by robots or removed. Crawl errors: this report shows all the errors that Google has found when crawling your site over the last 90 days. robots.txt editor: this is where you can edit your robots.txt and check for errors. The bottom of the page reveals your errors and warnings. Sign up to Google Analytics Google Analytics is a free service that tracks and reports website traffic. Providing insight into the demographics of site visitors, the performance of a specific campaign, and how long people are staying on your site. Make sure Google Analytics or the analytics package you’re using, is set up and ready to go from day one so you can measure and analyse traffic to your site. Site speed Use Google’s own site speed test tool to check how quickly your website loads and implement any changes it recommends. Mobile friendliness Is your website and its content equally optimised for any given screen size or device? Bear in mind that Google has stated that responsive design is its preferred method of mobile optimisation. Look through our thorough mobile-friendly checklist to help fix any problems. Title tags Title tags should be 50-60 characters long, including spaces. Your most important keywords need to be first in your title tag, with your least important words coming last. If your company name is not part of the important keyword phrases, put it at the end of the title tag. Do not duplicate title tags, they must be written differently for every page. Don’t mass replicate your title tags it will negatively affect your search visibility. Title tags must accurately describe the content on the page. Do not ‘keyword stuff’ title tags. Make your headline (<h1> tag) different from the title tag. Meta descriptions Make sure your most important keywords for the webpage show up in the meta description. Write legible, readable copy. A meta description should be no longer than 135 – 160 characters long. Any longer and search engines will chop the end off, so make sure any important keywords are nearer the front. Do not duplicate meta descriptions. Headlines The headlines for your articles should be under 55 characters to ensure their complete visibility in SERPs. Make sure they’re snappy, attractive and as descriptive as possible. H1 – H6 tags Make sure your headlines are tagged as H1, and any subheadings in your articles are tagged as H2, H3 etc. Makes sure they’re used in a descending, logical order. Images Make sure your images are all optimised for the web. Ensuring they’re not too large – and site-speed draining. As well as being properly labelled with titles and alt-text. XML Sitemaps/HTML Sitemap Make sure your website has an accurate site map in both XML and HTML format, to ensure thorough and complete indexing by Google. Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin208 Google+36 Twitter 244 Related articles Google’s mobile-first index: how to prepare your business How Black Friday can lead to valuable organic search opportunities Guide to 301 redirects and canonical tags This is how Google will present the results of the 2016 US election… Accelerated Mobile Pages If you’re using Google’s AMP project to provide mobile searchers with faster loading web pages, you need to make sure these are rendering properly. You can check for this in the Search Console AMP tool. Social media integration Do the social media icons on the site go to the correct pages? Do you have the right buttons and social plugins installed for what you are trying to accomplish and what you want the user to be able to do? (For example, does it ‘share a post’ rather than ‘Like’ your page on Facebook.) Secure Certificate If your site is ecommerce, or you’re using encrypted pages to protect visitor privacy on a form or elsewhere, you’ll need to check your certificate. Duplicate content If you have duplicate content on your own site, set up a 301 redirect so Google only indexes your preferred page. Ensure that Google is only indexing your preferred domain, i.e. either with the www prefix or without it: http://www.example.com or http://example.com. Google may treat the www and non-www versions of your domain as separate sites with separate pages, thus harming your visibility. If your republishing another site’s content (with permission of course) ensure there’s a rel=canonical tag on each page linking to the original source. Google News Double check your site is eligible for Google News, if not, try resubmitting once you’ve carried out Google’s suggestions. Nofollow Add rel=“nofollow” to any links that you don’t want search engine crawlers to follow. For instance, sponsored content or commercially led articles with links out to vendors or service providers. Check structured data The Structured Data section in Search Console contains information about all the structured data elements Google has located on your site, whether from Schema markup or other microformats. Check for any errors. If you click on the individual ‘Data Types’ it will show you exactly which URLs contain that particular markup and when it was detected. Error response codes Response codes, such as 400, 403, 404, 500 and 503, should all be investigated thoroughly. If you see multiple 404 results from internal site links, fix the offending links immediately. Makes sure 301s being used for all redirects, and avoid any 302 or 307 redirects. Internal linking Are you using internal linking in the most effective way? You should have a few relevant internal links per article (depending on length and type of content). Make sure the anchor text is descriptive of the linked page.

He called for a joined-up regulatory regime for big data, including a co-ordinated approach from regulators dealing with data protection, competition policy and consumer protection. It is fair to say, however, that big data is already on the radar of regulators, which have been quick to realise the potential harm created by a few big players with large pots of data. When it comes to big data awareness, Europe’s regulators have led the way. For example, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, Datatilsynet, issued a report on compliance issues connected with big data as far back as September 2013. In the US, the executive office of the president issued its report in May 2014. We have already had one European data protection supervisor (EDPS) opinion on big data, and we have seen big data cases reach the courts in the UK, such as the Vidal-Hall litigation against Google. Google was also the subject of regulatory activity in Spain, France and the Netherlands over its collection of data from various Google properties, including YouTube, in one pot to assist in targeted advertising. There is also a sign of the multi-faceted approach to regulation in the recent Bundeskartellamt investigation into Facebook, where German authorities are looking at whether the access Facebook has to large pots of data creates a competition law issue. According to an official of the agency, Facebook is a cause for concern as around 28 million Germans are on the site, which amounts to 35% of the country’s population. Aside from the increased willingness of regulators to look at big data issues, we are also seeing more litigation brought by private individuals concerned about the data others hold on them. For example, we have had a raft of right to be forgotten litigation in Europe, Russia and Japan. We can expect more of the same when the right to be forgotten is strengthened by the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018. Big data issues are also likely to come before the European Court in the next two years, with the next instalment of Max Schrems’s litigation against Facebook, a civil class action where he claims 25,000 plaintiffs have already signed up, with another 75,000 on a waiting list.  The litigation we’ve already seen shows a real challenge for big data. Organisations want to collect huge amounts of data to tailor their services to individuals and offer them what they want. There are still legal and security implications in all of this. Take the case of Uber, for example. The company collects large amounts of data from its users, including a precise location and direction of travel to enable a car the user has ordered to reach them. However, it also collects data such as the amount of battery power the user has left to help it determine the price. The important factor from a data protection point of view is to make sure all of this is disclosed and the user consents. There are obvious security concerns about holding this level of data, especially when coupled with the fact Uber also holds financial data. Uber has also been on the regulators’ radar having settled a case with the New York authorities earlier in 2016, after a 14-month investigation into its data handling practices. So what should those using big data be doing? First, they have to plan properly and have a targeted data acquisition strategy, rather than simply grabbing data because they can.  They need to carry out a data protection impact assessment, which will be mandatory from 2016 under GDPR and might already be required in some countries. They will have to make sure they are observing data protection legislation, and only collecting the disclosed data they need. They will also have to build a cyber security game plan around this data to make sure it is protected. Despite what some regulators might want, there is no chance of the big data genie going back into the bottle. We are, however, likely to see far higher regulatory activity and litigation when people do not get the balance right. Jonathan Armstrong is a compliance lawyer with Cordery in London.

Google Maps already had the option of booking Ola or Uber in India, and now, this is being extended to the mobile search bar itself. The option for ride-booking will show when a user tries to find directions to a place on the mobile search bar.

Skilled pilots can dip the basket of their balloons into the water and then soar away again into the sky. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) LOS ANGELES — USA TODAY Network debuted a first-of-its kind weekly virtual reality news show Thursday, inviting viewers to soar in 360-degrees at a hot-air balloon festival in New Mexico and to join high-liners above Arizona's canyons. Called “VRtually There” and co-produced with YouTube, the show's initial content is targeted towards action, along the lines of what's been shown on the USA TODAY YouTube channel in 360°, including flying with the Blue Angels and getting into the pit during the Indianapolis 500 race. In the new show's debut, viewers also can jump into the cockpit of an F-18 and take off. Ex-National Geographic producer David Hamlin will serve as executive producer. Thrill seekers go "highlining" in the Arizona desert on the USA TODAY Network "VRtually There" 360 show.  (Photo: USA TODAY) "VRtually" will be available on USA TODAY’s mobile app (iOS | Android), as well as its VR Stories app (iOS | Android), and YouTube, which has exclusivity for the first 60 days from each episode’s release. It will also work for desktop computer users and with phone-based VR viewer Google Cardboard and upcoming Google Daydream headset viewer. The production is one of several breaking ground in VR, a category that has its roots in gaming but that's branching out into other content, including news. These offer a 360-degree look at the world — up, down, left and right — with a swipe on mobile phones. More immersive experiences use headsets like the Samsung Gear, which connects to Galaxy phones, or Facebook's Oculus Rift, a specialized headset tethered to a powerful computer. Most folks watch 360° on Facebook and YouTube's mobile 360° channel without a viewer, which “is cool,” says Niko Chauls, director of applied technology for Gannett, the parent company of the USA TODAY Network, the publisher of this report. Add the viewer and “it’s a mind blowing, dazzling experience.” Vrtually There, a new 360 show from the USA TODAY Network  (Photo: USA TODAY) USA TODAY is not alone in exploring VR for news purposes. The Huffington Post and VR studio RYOT also have a ten-part “The Big Picture: News in Virtual Reality,” planned for the Hulu VR app in November, to be viewed on the new Google Daydream and the Samsung Gear VR virtual reality viewers. This year, VR drew closer to the mainstream as Facebook opened up the ability to view VR videos in the News Feed, and YouTube launched a dedicated 360° channel. The YouTube channel includes videos from media partners Showtime, Fox, GoPro, Sony, Warner Bros. and Red Bull. Toyota has signed as the first sponsor for "VRtually There" with a "cubemercial," a 360° ad produced for Toyota's Camry car that whisks the reviewer to Australia's wilderness. “VRtually There” is  produced by journalists at the 110 members of the Network, including USA TODAY and sister publications like the Arizona Republic, Des Moines Register and Indianapolis Star. New episodes will post Thursdays at 2 p.m. ET, with three segments lasting around 5 minutes. 0:00|7:21 This is a 360° video experience.

USA TODAY NETWORK “Our in-house VR content production is unique to the industry, allows us to showcase our great journalism across the NETWORK and allows us to expose our vast audience to this innovative storytelling,” said Joanne Lipman, USA TODAY NETWORK’s chief content officer, in a statement. With companies like Google, Samsung, Facebook, HTC, Sony and Microsoft investing in virtual reality, it made sense for Gannett to be there as well, notes Kevin Gentzel, chief revenue officer for Gannett. "That's a big tailwind," showing that VR is real, he adds. While the show is weekly now, Chauls wants to increase to a daily broadcast. The hurdle is production. The show is shot on multiple cameras which have to be "stitched" together in software, and that can take a lot of time. New automated software from companies like Google promise to greatly cut down on the time it takes to stitch, he adds. "This is the time to build the audience, get them used to the medium and what’s possible," he says.

Comments By Blair Hanley Frank Follow IDG News Service | Oct 20, 2016 4:22 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Cloud Computing Cloud Storage Data Storage Google Comments There are big changes afoot for Google Cloud Platform's storage offerings. On Thursday, the company announced a complete overhaul of the storage options available to customers, complete with new storage tiers and reduced pricing. Customers that need high availability storage can use Google's new fully managed Multi-Regional Cloud Storage service, which will replicate data across multiple Google Cloud data centers in different areas for high-uptime access. The company also launched a new Coldline storage service that's designed for data accessed less than once a year, such as backups. The storage changes are part of Google’s overall pitch to capture businesses in a highly competitive cloud market. Managed, multi-region storage will be helpful for customers that don’t want to worry about reliability, and the new Coldline storage will help GCP compete with other cold storage offerings, like Amazon Glacier. Google This chart shows the different tiers of Google Cloud Storage. With Multi-Regional storag, customers can choose to store their data in the U.S., EU and Asia. After that, the data is replicated across multiple regions, which are groups of Google Cloud Platform data centers. In the event of an outage in one region, Multi-Regional storage will route requests to a replica of the data that's still available. It costs 2.6 cents per GB stored per month, and is designed for applications like serving video or running a content-delivery network. Coldline storage lets users take data and archive it, while still retaining the ability to access it quickly. While it's built for archival use, users can get access to the data in a matter of milliseconds. Users pay .7 cents per GB per month for the data stored inside. Accessing that data costs 5 cents per GB retrieved. Google's Standard storage tier has been rebranded as Regional storage. As the name implies, files are stored in a single GCP region. The rebranding comes with a price cut, too: what used to cost 2.6 cents per GB per month now costs 2 cents. The Nearline storage service, which is designed for infrequently accessed content, is unchanged.  To help customers manage the spectrum of different storage tiers, Google is launching new data lifecycle management capabilities. Those let customers store data in different tiers while keeping it all in one bucket, which is basically a labeled group of data stored in GCP. In addition, a new policy feature lets customers automatically move data from different tiers based on its age, so that older data gets stored in Nearline or Coldline storage automatically. Google is also doing away with its Durable Reduced Availability tier of storage, which let businesses pay less for data storage in exchange for it being unavailable more often. DRA storage cost 2 cents per GB, the same as the new Regional storage offering. Existing customers can continue to use their DRA storage, so code that relies on it will still work. It will be interesting to see how all of these announcements affect enterprise interest in Google’s storage products, since the company has been pushing for more business users to adopt its cloud.

Speaking exclusively to TrustedReviews at Apps World 2016 in London, BaDoinkVR CEO Todd Glider hinted that Apple's less than inspiring 2016 product line-up – headlined by the same-y iPhone 7 – could belie its larger ambitions to make a splash in the world of virtual reality. Google, however, he added, enjoyed a clear advantage in the space at the moment. Glider told us: "The Daydream thing is huge. You’re going to see many more people taking the plunge into VR for the first time...[and] in the short term, Google will take the lead because of Daydream. "Apple has to have a trick up its sleeve, because its been a quite while since Apple's done anything interesting. "People are like: 'What’s going on?' The Apple Watch is under impressive and there’s [nothing] exciting about the iPhone. If you look at the iPhone 7 and compare it to any Samsung phone? No, I don’t think there’s anything interesting going on at Apple right now. "[But] I do think they’re going to plan something. They still believe in their mojo...and they’re going to do something with VR and AR. They have to." Glider isn't the first insider to speculate about Apple's potential plans for virtual reality hardware or a VR platform. The company's own co-founder, Steve Wozniak, has previously spoken out on the matter, while current Apple CEO Tim Cook has talked up the possibilities around augmented reality. Apple also has a number of patents that point to the development of an HMD (head-mounted display), and the rumour mill is rife with gossip that the iPhone 8's 'killer feature' could actually be a VR headset.

(Image: Debashis Sarkar/News18.com) Google latest flagship Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones doesn’t support Reliance Jio VoLTE calls by default. So, if you wish to use a Reliance Jio SIM card on the Pixel smartphones then you are cut off from standard calls and SMS and left with 4G mobile internet connectivity only. Also, the fact that Pixel smartphones are single SIM devices makes matters a bit difficult. For those unaware, Reliance Jio uses VoLTE for calls and SMS. So, if any smartphone doesn’t support VoLTE, then you will not be available to make or receive calls or SMS from the stock dialer or Message app. To make voice calls and SMS using Reliance Jio on the Pixel smartphones or any other non-VoLTE phones, users will have to download and use the Jio4GVoice app, available for free on Google Play. Also, remember that if you switch off mobile internet to save data, you will not be able to make or receive calls. Google Pixel smartphones are powered by Snapdragon 821. This SoC supports VoLTE. “The X12 LTE modem (on Snapdragon 821 SoC) is engineered to allow the Pixel to use the EVS codec—better known as Ultra HD Voice—for phone calls over VoLTE or Wi-Fi on supporting networks, so calls can sound even clearer than regular HD Voice, and stay connected longer in weaker signal conditions,” said Qualcomm in a statement. Despite having the hardware, the Pixel smartphone do not offer VoLTE option. This means there is scope for Google to release a software fix to provide support in future. We have reached out to Google on the same and are awaiting their response. Interestingly, its competitor Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are fully compatible with Reliance Jio out-of-the box.

Oct 20, 2016, 07:00 ET Share this article MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) is recognizing Verb Surgical's President & CEO Scott Huennekens as one of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs of 2016 at its Builders + Innovators Summit in Santa Barbara, California. Goldman Sachs selected Scott Huennekens as one of 100 entrepreneurs from multiple industries to be honored at the two-day event. Scott is a successful entrepreneur in the medical device and biotech industries, having served as CEO, board member and investor in numerous startups with market valuations that have totaled over $5B, and more importantly, with over 20 million patients that have benefited from the therapies and diagnostics of these companies. He is currently Chairman, President & CEO of Verb Surgical, Alphabet Inc. (formerly Google) and Johnson & Johnson's new start-up to revolutionize the future of surgery.  The company, located on the Google campus in Mountain View, CA, was founded in August 2015, with Scott joining as employee #1.  Verb's big vision is to democratize surgery globally, and in turn improve access to the benefits of surgery for the 5 billion people who do not have access today.  At the same time, Verb aims to improve outcomes, lower costs and enable more surgical procedures globally. There are over 200 employees currently working on building and commercializing the Verb platform, including team members at Verb, Verily (formerly Google Life Sciences) and Johnson & Johnson.   Prior to joining Verb, Scott led Volcano Corp., as its first and only President & CEO, from start-up in 2002 to its IPO in 2006 and sale to Philips in 2015.   Volcano 2015 revenue was > $400+ million and its market capitalization peaked at nearly $2 billion.  "This is a tremendous honor not for me, but for Verb and our partners at J&J and Verily," said Scott.  "Verb is a company driven by taking action for patients.  We are in a unique position to leverage technology in ways never imagined before, to create the future of surgery.  This a future we call digital surgery, which we believe can improve access to the 5 billion patients worldwide that need surgical care." "We are honored to recognize Scott Huennekens as one of the most intriguing entrepreneurs of 2016," said David Solomon, co-head of investment banking at Goldman Sachs. "This is the fifth year that we've hosted the Builders + Innovators Summit where emerging business leaders gather to discuss their common interests in building thriving organizations." (link to video http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/technology-driving-innovation/builders-and-innovators-2016/index.html?videoId=146334) For more than 145 years, Goldman Sachs has been advising and financing entrepreneurs as they launch and grow their businesses. In addition to honoring 100 entrepreneurs, the summit consists of general sessions and clinics led by Goldman Sachs experts, seasoned entrepreneurs, academics and business leaders as well as resident scholars. About Verb Surgical Verb Surgical is working with physicians around the world to create the future of surgery.  A future that aims to achieve improved patient outcomes, lower costs, and greater hospital efficiency. Verb Surgical was founded in 2015 with technology, expertise, and funding from Verily (formerly Google Life Sciences) and Ethicon, a medical device company in the Johnson & Johnson family of companies. This company will continue in strong partnership with Verily and Johnson & Johnson (Google and Johnson & Johnson Team for Robotic Surgery) to advance the surgical tools and capabilities available to surgeons and OR professionals today.

By Agamoni Ghosh October 20, 2016 12:07 BST Google rolls out Android 7.1 NougatGoogle Google has started seeding the Android 7.1 Nougat developer preview. The update is currently rolling out to the Nexus 5X, 6P and Pixel C users only. While Android 7.0 is yet to hit most Android devices, the company has released the latest developer preview that brings some new additions to the Nougat update. The update brings app shortcuts, reworked quick toggles, restart option in start menu, redesigned check for update screen and more. As of now, Google's Pixel and Pixel XL are the only Android devices to come pre-installed with the latest Android OS version. The Android 7.1 preview is expected to start hitting Android devices by other manufacturers like Lenovo, Samsung, LG and HTC from November. The company has also revealed its plans to deliver another preview of the Android 7.1 update in November followed by the final public release in December. Google's Nexus phones eligble for the update will get the update first. To install the latest developer preview on any of these devices there are three routes: Sign up for the Android Beta program. If you are already a part of the program, you will receive the Android 7.1 preview OTA update automatically. Alternatively, one can download the factory image as a TGZ file and flash the image to a phone by using the flash.bat method. One can also download the OTA zip file which will install the latest preview build. For those who are not familiar with the flashing methods or are not able to access the Android Beta program, it is recommended that you wait for an OTA public release in December.

português suomeksi svenska Introducing DocuSign Payments: The New Way to Sign and Pay DTM Leader Partners with Stripe and is Supported by Apple, Google and Authorize.net to Launch Innovative New Platform Service News provided by DocuSign, Inc. Oct 20, 2016, 06:30 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- For businesses seeking to collect payments and signatures as part of the same agreement process – and for the 65%* that experience payment delays or a failure to collect altogether – DocuSign, the eSignature and Digital Transaction Management (DTM) leader, today announced its latest platform innovation: DocuSign Payments. Slated for release early next year in partnership with international payment processor Stripe – and supported by Apple, Google and Authorize.net – DocuSign Payments saves time and effort by providing a fast and easy way to collect payments and signatures in just one step. This delivers a superior customer experience, instant payment, and an error-free contract-to-payment process. At launch, the pre-built integration with Stripe will give customers the option to use Apple Pay, Android Pay or any major credit card; PayPal, Authorize.net and other payment options will follow soon after. The use cases for DocuSign Payments are practically limitless – apartment lease agreements, insurance policies, contractor services, mobile phone purchases, car registration renewals, hotel stays, car rentals or leases, accounting and tax preparation, among many others. "After years of market research, extensive platform development, and in partnership with leading payments providers, we're announcing DocuSign Payments today," said Keith Krach, chairman and CEO at DocuSign. "This strategic initiative will offer significant incremental value to more than 250,000 companies and 100 million users who will be able to DocuSign and pay in one easy step as part of the DocuSign Global Trust Network." DocuSign has helped its customers come to agreement – 100% digitally – for years. Over that time, a vast majority noted that collecting signatures and payments together was a huge challenge – the steps are disjointed and it can have a material impact on a company's bottom line. "In response, we dedicated extensive resources to platform development, we partnered with Stripe, and we sourced the support of Apple, Google and Authorize.net, all to help create the new Payments service we are announcing today," noted Ron Hirson, chief product officer, DocuSign. "We know there are multiple payment options available for almost all forms of purchases. And we wanted to make that same fast, easy, secure all-digital experience available whenever you electronically sign an agreement." Adding payments into the existing signing process is simple and straightforward. After a brief, one-time setup to connect DocuSign with an existing payment gateway – or sign up for one right within DocuSign – a sender simply adds a payment tag to their contract or agreement, and sends. When the signer receives and signs the document, they then have the option to pay with a credit card or a mobile wallet such as Apple Pay or Android Pay in as many as 130 currencies. Funds are collected immediately. "It should be easy to pay for anything online—whether that's for a pair of shoes, a cab ride, or now a contract that is being signed," said Cristina Cordova, the head of business development at Stripe. "We're excited to work closely with DocuSign to make it possible to easily and securely accept payments from anyone, anywhere in the world, whether they're on a desktop or mobile device." For its part, Google wants to make it easier for businesses to offer simpler, faster in-app payment solutions for their customers. "By including Android Pay as one of the key options in the new DocuSign Payments functionality, people will be able to speed through the sign-and-pay process with their Android phones in as few as two clicks – a real benefit for people looking to quickly sign, make payments and move on," said Pali Bhat, global head of payment products at Google. With DocuSign Payments entering a limited beta testing phase ahead of launch next year, many different types of businesses and non-profit organizations have shown interest. "Since our entire organization is run by volunteers – all of whom have day jobs – time is one of our most valuable resources. Because of this, we are always looking for new efficiencies," explained Alex Monahan, executive director at Last Hope K9 Rescue – an all-breed rescue center for abandoned dogs in Boston, MA. "Combining our adoption contracts with a payment solution would save considerable time with each adoption. And with more than 1,000 adoptions a year, we can allocate this time in a way that will directly impact the number of dogs' lives that we can help save – which, after all, is our core mission." "As a small independent insurance agency, we process a large number of transactions – and whenever we can reduce the number of processing steps, our customer service and profitability improve," said Rob Martinek, principal of Martinek Insurance Services in Nashville, TN. "Our particular challenge is that customers purchase policies by signing the insurance application, but our payment collection is a separate, manual process. We often see delays in the sending of payments, resulting in policy cancellations and a reinstatement process. With DocuSign, signatures and payment can be collected in a single step – problem solved." Yale Management Services Inc., a property management company servicing more than 4,000 units in the greater Los Angeles area, has similar issues. "With the large number of properties we look after, you can imagine the challenges of ensuring rents are paid (often by paper check), banked and managed on a monthly basis," said Rick Kaufman, president of Yale Management Services Inc. "By signing a lease with DocuSign and collecting the monthly payments electronically, we'll be able to limit almost all those hassles. DocuSign Payments will make the process of renting out a home or apartment faster and easier for everyone." DocuSign will be showcasing DocuSign Payments alongside the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas next week from Sunday, October 23 to Wednesday, October 26 – for more information, visit http://esign.docusign.com/payments.

Not so much. Except, every Pixel review did call Google out for this. Surely they drew the line at Google's 2016 flagship missing optical image stabilization - not just in the regular-size, but in the Plus XL model as well - stereo speakers, and water resistance - things that were pointed to last year as indicators Apple was falling behind? Turns out, not deal-breakers either. Except, every Pixel review did call Google out for this. Here's a quick cut/paste image job I did yesterday, highlighting how Pixel reviews did, in fact, call out Google and the Pixel for the things Ritchie claims they are not calling them out for. It's almost like the Pixel is being graded on a curve. When you're as deeply enveloped in the Apple bubble as people like Rene Ritchie and John Gruber, reality inside the bubble starts folding in on itself. You sit deep inside your bubble, and when you look outwards, the curves and bends of the bubble's surface twist and turn reality outside of the bubble into ever more grotesque and malformed versions of it. Ever since the unveiling of the Pixel up to and including the reviews published yesterday, everybody in the technology media has been pointing out the exact same things Ritchie claims are not being pointed out. The amount of mental gymnastics and selective perception one must undertake - one could call such exercises flat-out lies - to claim that the major technology media is "against Apple" or "grading [the Pixel] on a curve" is so humongous that I honestly didn't think it was realistically and humanly possible. And I say this as someone who once got a flood of really nasty and angry emails because OSNews had not yet separated the FreeBSD category and its icon from the generic BSD category, so FreeBSD and Dragonfly BSD people alike were furious at me for putting a Dragonfly BSD story in the generic BSD category because it had a FreeBSD icon. I've been around the block when it comes to the kind of reality-warping, deeply idiotic bullshit the technology world can conjure up over absolutely nothing. When I was 17, I went on a trip to Rome, the most beautiful city in the world. As I stood atop the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking down upon the countless tourists swarming St. Peter's Square, I realised how easy it would be to lose touch with the people down there if you spent most of your time up here. The bubble is no different.

Google launches Android Pay at 5,000 Hong Kong locations Google launches ‘simple and secure’ mobile payment system, seeking to close ground with WeChat Wallet and Apple Pay which launched in Hong Kong earlier this year PUBLISHED : Thursday, 20 October, 2016, 5:00am UPDATED : Thursday, 20 October, 2016, 10:09am Comments:   Zen Soo https://twitter.com/zensoo Share PrintEmail Related topics Google Related Articles Tech Google, Visa and Mastercard want to get rid of passwords 25 Oct 2016 Leaders & Founders Google and Facebook teaming up for 12,800 kilometre fibre-optic cable from Los Angeles to Hong Kong 13 Oct 2016 Leaders & Founders These are the 10 wealthiest tech billionaires in the world 11 Oct 2016 Google has launched its mobile payments system Android Pay in Hong Kong, allowing Android users to make contactless payments in-store as it pits itself against Apple Pay and Tencent’s WeChat Wallet in the city. Smartphone users whose handsets are enabled with near-field communication (NFC) technology and runs KitKat 4.4 or higher will be able to download the Android Pay app and pay for purchases at over 5,000 locations in Hong Kong, according to the company. “Android Pay makes mobile payment as simple and secure as possible,” said Pali Bhat, global head of payments products at Google. “Just wake your phone, hold it to the contactless payment terminal, and your payment is done.” Users with Mastercard or Visa credit cards from six banks in the city – namely HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, Standard Chartered, Dah Sing Bank, DBS and the Bank of East Asia – will be able to link their cards to Android Pay, and make payments at a variety of shops including convenience stores such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, as well as fast food restaurants such as McDonald’s and Pacific Coffee. Google’s move follows that of Apple, which rolled out Apple Pay for iPhone and Apple Watch in July. Tencent’s WeChat Wallet, a built-in mobile wallet in popular messaging app WeChat, also landed in Hong Kong in January, allowing Hongkongers to link their credit cards to the wallet and pay for air tickets within the app, or even send money to friends. Leonie Valentine, managing director of sales and operations for Google in Hong Kong, said that 80 per cent of Hongkongers own a smartphone and the advanced mobile usage is one of the reasons why the company decided to launch Android Pay in the city. Kitty Fok, managing director for IDC China, said that Hong Kong’s mature payments systems could make it difficult for companies like Google and Apple to encourage users to adopt contactless mobile payments in the city. “Getting users to use Android Pay regularly might take a long process, especially since Hongkongers already have many payment options and are already familiar with paying via Octopus and credit cards,” Fok said. She added that partnering with merchants to offer incentives to consumers, such as giving discounts when users make payment with Android Pay, could help to encourage more users to make the switch. “In China, Alipay and WeChat Wallet were successful because they were able to offer users discounts when they use mobile payments, thus encouraging users to adopt that payment method,” Fok said. However, as Android smartphones take up a larger share of the market than iPhones, Fok believes that Android Pay could also amass more users compared to Apple. According to data from Statista, 84.7 per cent of all smartphones sold to end users in the third quarter of 2015 were Android-based. Google Wallet, which was previously Android’s mobile payments app, has since been refreshed to work as a standalone app that allows friends to request and transfer money to each other. However, Google Wallet services are still exclusive to the US, and are not currently available in Hong Kong.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hong Kong property experts ‘shocked’ at record sale result for Kai Tak area site 2 Outdated fintech regulations hurting Hong Kong, Jack Ma says 3 The next black swan could be fast approaching from a region that few are talking about 4 China, Russia join the crowded sky: widebody planes to cut reliance on Airbus, Boeing 5 Zhongwang says it’ll bring jobs stability to Aleris, hits back at US opposition to US$2.3 bln takeover Shared 1 Hong Kong property experts ‘shocked’ at record sale result for Kai Tak area site 2 Outdated fintech regulations hurting Hong Kong, Jack Ma says 3 Two-thirds of smartphone users now paying by mobile 4 The next black swan could be fast approaching from a region that few are talking about 5 Zhongwang says it’ll bring jobs stability to Aleris, hits back at US opposition to US$2.3 bln takeover Commented 1 Beijing interpretation on Legislative Council oath taking rattles Hong Kong 2 Hong Kong oath-taking saga shows ugly side of city’s colonial legacy 3 Mainland paper slams Hong Kong independence advocates in 1,000-word commentary 4 Youngspiration duo increasingly isolated by pan-democratic allies, as antics cause harm and chaos 5 Time to resume talks, Taiwanese president tells the mainland Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2016 2H       You may also like China How new Xinjiang party boss became front runner in race to be one of China’s most powerful men 30 Oct 2016 - 11:24pm 2 Out on the town: experiencing Macau is far from a gamble In partnership with Macao Government Tourism Office Why bankers and cocaine are best of friends 30 Oct 2016 - 8:46pm 9 Hong Kong’s Emerging Force: The Rise of Technology Start-ups Presented by: Credit Suisse Hong Kong Illegal fees, little rest and no documents: domestic helpers in Hong Kong continue to fight for their rights 30 Oct 2016 - 8:07am 21 Hong Kong Should history lessons in schools include details about Hong Kong’s 1967 riots? 30 Oct 2016 - 10:29pm 9 China A billion billion calculations per second: where no computer has gone before 29 Oct 2016 - 8:00am 4 Hong Kong Meet Viveca Chow, Broadway musical star from Hong Kong Oct 28th 2016, 11:57pm World Plane bursts into flame at Chicago airport Oct 29th 2016, 3:45pm China China has world’s most skewed sex ratio at birth – again 27 Oct 2016 - 10:04pm 2 Post Magazine The Asian men who buy sex with Cambodian virgins 28 Oct 2016 - 10:54am 3 Post Magazine With the paedophile-hunters on the streets of Phnom Penh 28 Oct 2016 - 10:55am 1 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Lifestyle London Life How the Google Campus creche is revolutionising workplace childcare As hotdesking spaces invest in more office creches, Lucy Tobin visits Google Campus to see how tech is revolutionising childcare Lucy Tobin Thursday 20 October 2016 10:34 BST Bringing up baby Getty Tech has always beaten other careers when it comes to perks. The banks hand staff the odd free pizza (if they work until midnight); Old Street roundabout’s directional offices serve free gourmet lunches every day. Staff can take their pick from free office bars, nap pods, massages, home-working when they fancy it, ping-pong tables, sabbaticals... But as the industry has grown — tech and science now employ 700,000 people in London — competition to entice the capital’s best workers to their desks is intense.  Fun perks have transformed into generous employee rights — and tech is taking the lead on childcare.  “I thought having a baby would really limit my career options,” says one developer with two children under four. “But I actually moved jobs during maternity leave, and three firms all offered flexible hours, help with nursery fees, working from home — one even said I could bring the baby into the office when I needed to.” Read more 'Childcare costs £16,000 a year in London' For evidence of tech’s adoption of new parents, look no further than Google’s Shoreditch entrepreneur hub on a Tuesday morning. It hosts a start-up school, with the timetable including lessons  on marketing, branding and seeking funding, from the likes of venture capitalist Eileen Burbidge (who has four children) and Seedcamp investor Carlos Espinal.  But this course invites tots under 18 months too. There are changing mats at the back, baby toys and beanbags around the room, and a highchair for hungry babes. So far 160 parents have enrolled — about 85 per cent of them are mums, many on maternity leave from employers including 10 Downing Street, Amazon, investment banks, law firms, the BBC and John Lewis.  Derivatives lawyer Shruti Ajitsaria, 37, is halfway through the course. She’s working on a website where kids can write diaries about their holidays while learning about the history behind the locations.  She has two daughters aged six and four, but it was embarking on her third maternity leave with her baby son “that gave me the impetus to sign up [to Google Campus for Mums] to work on my idea.” Ajitsaria, who is now back at work part-time at a City law firm, explains. “It’s a relaxed environment — if your baby cries, people just talk louder. If a baby runs up to a high-profile speaker, they pick them up and continue presenting with someone else’s baby in their arms.  The kids are all right: Google Campus for mums, is a child-friendly space  “On the first day one woman gave this impressive presentation, while holding her week-old baby. I was in awe. I enjoyed studying in the evenings on maternity leave rather than sleeping — it felt good to do something different.” Campus for Mums was started in Tel Aviv by a “Googler” who had just returned from maternity leave. This gave Sarah Drinkwater, Google’s Head of Campus, the idea to bring it to London. “I thought the community in London — which at that time was very male-dominated — would benefit from a programme aimed at mums, business- focused, quite selective, but who often haven’t worked in the traditional tech scene,” she says. “The only thing they have in common is they’re all parents, and are all starting something new for the first time.”  Three years on, London’s Campus for Mums idea has spread to Google sites in Madrid, Tel Aviv, Warsaw, Seoul and São Paulo. In the capital, graduates of the course run a “parent tech” group of entrepreneurs solving problems faced by families. There’s a breast cancer surgeon who enrolled at Google Campus on maternity leave, unable to hyperlink an email. She’s now building an app to help patients cut through obfuscating medical language.  Green mother and baby changing bag products - in pictures 12 show all Green mother and baby changing bag products - in pictures 1/12 Pai Skincare Pomegranate & Pumpkin Seed Stretch Mark System, RRP £45 If Natalie Portman swears by it then we all should.

Available at Whole Foods, Lloyds Pharmacy, Holland & Barrett, Waitrose, Ocado paiskincare.com 2/12 Earth Friendly Baby Chamomile Shampoo & Body Wash, RRP £4.89 When it comes to bath time for the little one, you want something which does it all-in-one as gently as possible. Flip around many conventional washes and you’ll find Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) in the ingredients list, a proven potential skin irritant which makes products foam. Alternatively, this eco friendly option uses skin loving ingredients derived from coconuts to create suds and wash babies clean, whilst extracts of chamomile and lavender soothe. You’ll safely find no tears here. Available at Boots, Asda, Waitrose, Tesco, Mothercare and Superdrug earthfriendlybaby.co.uk 3/12 Lulu & Boo Organics Rose Soothing Baby Spray, RRP £16 In times of extra soothing, especially when it comes to the baby bottom area an organic aloe vera packed skin soother is just what is needed.

Take the natural approach with these cheap and cheerful wipes that don’t compromise on performance.

Available at Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Tesco, Boots, Lloyds Pharmacy, Mothercare and Whole Foods. naty.com 5/12 Naty Diapers The real deal in green diapers!

Naty went on a mission to perfect their eco-diaper without compromising performance and comfort for your little one. Naty diapers are completely bleach free, contain no fragrance, latex or TBT (tributylin - a biocide, a toxic form of which used to be used to prevent the growth of marine organisms on the hulls of large ships) are hypo-allergenic and come in various sizes.

With beeswax and lanolin, it also creates a natural barrier to keep that softness baby bottoms are so famous for! Available at Waitrose, Whole Foods and Planet Organic weleda.co.uk 8/12 Weleda Calendula Baby Oil, £9.50 There’s a general rule of thumb to go by when you’re combing through the ingredients on baby products, and that’s the less of them there are the better. It doesn't get purer than this Weleda oil which only contains two ingredients; sesame oil and the previously mentioned skin saviour calendula. As well as after bathing, it is perfect for a baby massage and will have the added bonus of leaving your own hands silky smooth. Nothing wrong with sharing the benefits is there? Available at Waitrose, Whole Foods and Planet Organic weleda.co.uk 9/12 Nom Nom Organics Relax Oil - Frankincense, Lavender, and Chamomile, £20 This is a special one for the mums.

What makes this solid coconut oil just a little bit more special is the lovely scent provided by the vanilla extract and the extra nourishment thanks to the addition of Vitamin E.

Available at Waitrose waitrose.com 12/12 Neal’s Yard Remedies Organic Baby Powder. RRP £5 Baby Powder has always been a hero product for parents.

Let’s not deny it, we’ve all been there! Amazingly, the organic gurus at Neal's Yard Remedies have a talc-free option which is just as effective and fragrance free - ideal for the delicate skin of newborns. Available at Neals Yard Remedies stores, Whole Foods, Planet Organic nealsyardremedies.com Another graduate, Adele Frejus, 35, attended one of the first courses when her son Cai was a toddler, before launching her baking business and website, BKD, which now sells hundreds of thousands of kits each year.  Many course attendees yearn to turn their start-up idea into a tech business that will fit more easily into their life as a parent. The 300,000 UK businesses currently run by mothers with young children generate £7 billion a year and thus tech firms are mindful that spending a bit of cash or time retaining their top talent when they become parents is a worthy investment.  So they offer generous time off — four months’ paid leave from Facebook, five from Twitter, for all new parents — fathers as well as mothers, and adoptive parents. They’re more flexible than Olympic gymnast Max Whitlock: there’s nothing unusual about the offering from Old Street social payments app Circle Pay, which gives staff unlimited holiday. European boss Marieke Flament says: “We’re not here to police when people get in the office and when they leave, or if they want to work from home. Family responsibilities are very much respected — happier individuals are better-performing individuals.” Read more Google Flights tells you the best time to buy an airline ticket It’s a philosophy that Rohan Silva, the brains behind Tech City and co-founder of the creative working space Second Home, reckons will help popularise Second Home’s second site in London Fields, which opens next June with a nursery and crèche (bilingual in English and Mandarin, obviously) on-site. “The goal is to create the most family-friendly working environment in the world, helping more parents to start businesses — and start-ups to hire people with young children,” he says. “It’s designed to support family-friendly working — breastfeeding areas, scooter parking for kids, rounded corners in the café.  “We don’t think it’s fair that only the likes of Google, Goldman Sachs and the Foreign Office should have the right to offer employees childcare facilities — it should be available to everyone.” The best mother and baby Instagram accounts 5 show all The best mother and baby Instagram accounts 1/5 The Yes Mum @theyesmummum 2/5 Tiba + Marl @tibaandmarl 3/5 Selfish Mother @selfishmother 4/5 Little Prints Clothing @littleprintskidsclothing 5/5 Don’t Buy Her Flowers @Steph_dontbuyherflowers While there are still pockets of male-dominated tech firms, many start-up founders are now thirtysomething parents with a child-friendly culture in mind. Take Sarah Wood, founder of Unruly, the video ad tech company bought by News Corp for up to £114 million last year. She bought her son into the office when he was sick — including on the day she met Rupert Murdoch to announce the deal when “he hung out in the sleep pod where I could go kiss him and make sure he was OK”. Unruly has flexible working hours and job-share options for parents, and Wood says the office’s lounge area and games room are available “to help parents who have children off school sick”. Drinkwater identifies a current crop of “parent founders” who from the outset are thinking about a culture that works for all employees — they might let staff set their own hours so they can leave for a school pick-up, or go back to their laptop later on. She explains: “The strength of London’s tech community is its diversity — spanning gender, parents, older entrepreneurs. Innovation by everyone, for everyone — that’s how it succeeds.” Follow Lucy Tobin on Twitter: @lucytobin  Lucy Tobin’s parenting blog is runoutofwomb.com More about: Childcare Google Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Home Industry Tech Google Television: Here’s how ‘Unplugged’ online TV for reluctant subscribers will hit cable networks Google Television: Here’s how ‘Unplugged’ online TV for reluctant subscribers will hit cable networks Alphabet Inc. started by Google founders has reportedly signed an agreement with CBS Corporation with an aim to introduce the network on the web television service planned by the company. By: FE Online | Updated: October 21, 2016 1:45 PM Google is said to be in advanced level talks with Viacom Inc., 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney to make them distribute their channels for web TV. (Representative Pic: Reuters) Alphabet Inc. started by Google founders has reportedly signed an agreement with CBS Corporation with an aim to introduce the network on the web television service planned by the company. The tech major is also said to be in advanced level talks with Viacom Inc., 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney to make them distribute their channels, a Reuters report said. The news earlier appeared on Wall Street Journal. This highly anticipated service by Google is to be a part of YouTube. According to sources cited by Reuters, the service will launch early next year and will contain all of CBS’s content which includes NFL games. This latest feature to be introduced by Google is termed as ‘Unplugged’ or ‘skinny bundle’, as it will have fewer channels than a normal dish connection, and will cost around $ 40 dollars per month. As of now, it is not clear which networks of Viacom and Fox will become a part of the Google service. The online TV market is already quite saturated. With Sony Corp and Dish Network Corp already having launched ‘skinny bundles’, it remains to be seen what strategy Google will apply to make its new feature appealing to viewers who hesitate to take up dish tv connections. In the next few months, even AT&T and Hulu and web Tv service by Time Warner Inc, Disney, Fox and Comcast Corp is expected to go live. Even general cable operators have started to bring out packages for consumers who do not want to pay for the expensive packages. The online TV service has reportedly been a plan by Google since a long time now, which had been shelved for some time. Even Apple had thought about bringing out this service but later thought against it and it never came to fruition. This war between Silicon Valley giants is only going to be great for consumers who do not like to pay too much for cable TV because of the pricing and inconvenience.

By mid-day online correspondent | Posted 20-Oct-2016 The first phone of Google, Pixel/Pixel XL, is going to enter the Indian market on October 25. With the introduction of Pixel, Google seems to end its Nexus segment and create a new chapter in its phone history. Let us now take a look at some of Pixel’s special features: Build and Design: Though Pixel resembles iPhone, yet on looking at it from close quarters, one can find its resemblance with HTC. The phone is available in three colour variants like Quite Black, Very Silver and Really Blue. The phone is sturdy, has a flat metal frame and rounded edges. The phone has a glass top which results in a better grip. Display: Pixel XL flaunts a 5.5-inch QuadHD display and a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. The AMOLED display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 coating and its black levels are quite good. Chipset, RAM, Storage: Both the phones run of Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 821 chipset. There are two kinds of storage- 32GB and 128GB. Camera: The phone comes with a 12.3MP rear camera having an f/2.0 aperture. It has a front camera of 8MP loaded with an aperture of f/2.4 and pixel size of 1.4 micron. Battery and Connectivity: Google Pixel XL is backed by 3450mAh Li-ion non-removable battery. The phone comes with 5V/3A or 9V/2A adapter which has a USB Type C input and it easily supports 4G. Operating System: Pixel runs Android 7.1 Nougat OS. Live wallpapers, notification shades and circular app icons are interesting additions to the phone. Price of the impressive Google Pixel starts from Rs 57,000 for the 32GB base model and the price of its higher verison 128GB Pixel XL goes up to Rs 76,000. Though the phone is made by HTC, Google has complete control over its hardware and software. So, we can expect this latest introduction by Google to provide the best Android experience.

That’s if you decide to go with 32GB of storage. If you opt for 128GB you’re looking at £699 for the Pixel and £819 for the Pixel XL.

This will allow readers to quickly validate or debunk online stories. Related fact-checking stories will appear on-screen underneath the main headline. The example Google uses shows a headline over passport checks for pregnant women, with a link to Full Fact’s analysis. Readers will be able to see if stories are fake or if claims in the headline are false or being exaggerated. Fact Check will initially be available in the UK and US through the Google News site as well as the News & Weather apps for both Android and iOS. Publishers who wish to become part of the new service can apply to have their sites included. “We're excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” the company said. Fact-checking has become common for online publishers. Organisations such as the International Fact-Checking Network, PolitFact and Full Fact analyse claims by politicians and other public speakers to determine if they are true or not. Facebook has struggled to prevent fake headlines appearing in its own trending news feature. After the company swopped human curators for an algorithm, a fake story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly being fired over allegiances to Hilary Clinton caused controversy. While Google doesn't name Donald Trump or Brexit explicitly, authors such as Ralph Keyes claim we now live in a “post-truth” era, where debates rarely focus on facts or policy, but on emotion and wild claims. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has often been found to make false or misleading statements. Politifact has rated 71 percent of his statements as false. This week he wrongly advised his supports to go out and vote on November 28, 20 days after the US elections are actually being held, on November 8. – The IndependentSHOW ALL Cape Times Eusebius McKaiser: Theft as economic transformation Fransman hits at Mantashe's 'regime change' 10-year-old commits ‘suicide’ Suspicion over bid to save stadium Warning issued over super supermoon Most Read Warning issued over super supermoon Eusebius McKaiser: Theft as economic transformation 10-year-old commits ‘suicide’ Fransman hits at Mantashe's 'regime change' Suspicion over bid to save stadium Advertisement MORE cape timesMenu News| Sport| Business| Opinion| Technology| Lifestyle| Arts Portal| Escape Times| Classifieds| cape timesMenu News| Sport| Business| Opinion| Technology| Lifestyle| Arts Portal| Escape Times| Classifieds| INFO About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather SITES BabyNet.co.za Glamour.co.za GQ.co.za Ilisolezwe Isolezwe IOL Jobs IOL Property IOL Sportzone Loot.co.za Classifieds WomanOnline SECTIONS News Business Sport Motoring Tonight Lifestyle Travel Scitech About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather

Britta O'Boyle20 October 2016Phones Google / Apple Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google's Pixel and Pixel XL replace the Nexus line-up with a couple of premium and desirable devices running pure Android. The Pixel is the smaller of the two smartphones and its price tag puts it in iPhone territory. The question is, how does it compare to Apple's latest model? Read on for the differences and similarities between the Google Pixel and Apple's iPhone 7. Google Pixel review Apple iPhone 7 review Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Design Both premium designs with fingerprint sensors iPhone 7 smaller, slimmer, lighter and waterproof  Pixel has headphone jack and USB Type-C The Google Pixel and Apple iPhone 7 look different as you would expect, but both offer stunning, premium, well-built designs. The Pixel opts for a combination of aluminium and glass, with a fingerprint sensor on the rear, while the iPhone 7 is all about aluminium and places its fingerprint sensor within the Home button on the front. The iPhone 7 is water and dust resistant to IP67, while the Pixel is only IP53, meaning it cannot be submerged. The headphone jack is removed on the iPhone 7 in favour of the Lightning only and stereo speakers, while the Pixel has down-firing speakers either side of the USB Type-C port, but it keeps the headphone jack intact at the top. There are no physical buttons on the front of Pixel. The Pixel measures 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.6mm and weighs 143g, while the iPhone 7 is smaller, lighter and slimmer, measuring 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm and weighing 138g. Google's phone comes in Very Silver, Quite Black and Really Blue, though the latter is not coming to the UK. Apple's phone comes in Rose Gold, Gold, Silver, Black and Jet Black. Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Display Pixel has larger, crisper display iPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionality Pixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCD The Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright. The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition. The iPhone 7 also has 3D Touch, which is Apple's version of a pressure sensitive display. Users will get access to different features and functions based on the force with which they press. Google Pixel XL vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus vs Samsung Galaxy Note 7: What's the difference? Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Camera Both have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperture Pixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider aperture iPhone 7 has optical image stabilisation The Google Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel rear camera offering an aperture of f/2.0 and 1.55µm pixels. There is video stabilisation, phase detection autofocus and laser detection autofocus all on board, along with a dual-LED flash. The Apple iPhone 7 also has a 12-megapixel rear camera with a slightly wider aperture of f/1.8. It has optical image stabilisation and phase detection autofocus, as well as a quad-LED flash. In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash. Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either. Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Hardware Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM support Both available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GB Pixel has bigger battery capacity The Google Pixel and the Apple iPhone 7 both feature a quad-core processor under their hoods. The Pixel opts for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 with 4GB of RAM support, while the iPhone 7 features Apple's A10 Fusion chip and embedded M10 motion coprocessor and there is 3GB of RAM support. The Pixel is available in 32GB and 128GB storage options and the iPhone 7 is available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB options. Neither device offers microSD storage expansion. In terms of battery, the Pixel has a 2770mAh capacity, while the iPhone 7 is thought to be significantly smaller at 1960mAh. In real world use, the iPhone 7's battery life isn't amazing, but the Pixel does perform well, delivering at least a day of use.  Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Software Pixel runs vanilla Android iPhone 7 runs iOS Both have personal assistants The Google Pixel runs on Android 7.1 Nougat and it features Google Assistant built-in, accessed via a long press of the home button in the new launcher. It's a pure Android experience so it doesn't feature software bloatware like a Samsung or Sony for example. It brings with it all the latest features Google has to offer through Android and for those of you who are Google users and have Google accounts, you'll get a seamless experience. The Apple iPhone 7 runs on iOS 10, which brings with it all the latest features Apple has to offer. In terms of personal assistant, you get Siri, who is accessed via a long press of the physical Home button on the front of the device. For those of you who have Macs or use other Apple devices, the iPhone 7 will deliver a seamless experience across all your devices. Google Pixel exclusive features explored: A cut above the rest of Android? Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Price Both start at £599 Both the Google Pixel and Apple iPhone 7 start at £599 for the 32GB model. Add another £100 and you'll be able to get your hands on a 128GB model of either.  The iPhone 7 is also then offered in a 256GB model, as we mentioned, which costs a further £100 for a price of £799. Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Conclusion The Google Pixel and Apple iPhone 7 are very closely matched in terms of specs and price. The Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options. Ultimately, the decision between these two devices will come down to which design you prefer and which platform you prefer. Both are solid in their builds, seamless in their performance and they both have brilliant cameras.

Different images are pulled from Google Earth, Google+ and partners like 500px. This app was initially a Pixel Phone exclusive, but you can now download it on any Android smartphone. Aside from picking out a static or live wallpaper there are a few options in this new app. You can have a new wallpaper posted to your phone each day and if you are using a device that is running Android N, you can set different images for your home screen and lock screen. Honestly, this app currently performs best if you have a Pixel smartphone. You can tap into the Live Data, Live Earth, and New elements categories. Live Earth is especially interesting because your wallpaper displays a real-time perspective of the globe and where the sun is hitting. The Live Data category features live wallpapers that change based on factors such as the amount of charge your phone has left, how busy your day is, or the weather. You can download Google Wallpapers from the Good e-Reader App Store. Michael Kozlowski (6639 Posts) Michael Kozlowski is the Editor in Chief of Good e-Reader.

Kathryn Lindsay, Refinery29 Thursday 20 October 2016 10:08 BST Uber already feels like the fastest way to get from place to place, but it just got even quicker for those who use Google. Both iPhone and Android users who have the Google App can request an Uber straight from the result page, reports The Next Web, saving some extra clicks. Let's say you use the app to Google directions to the airport. This new feature won't just show you directions, but will also show you the distance and estimated fair of the closest Uber. It then allows you to launch the ride-hailing app with your current and desired destinations already entered. Having everything pre-filled when you open the app means a car can be hailed in practically a second, which makes all the difference if your flight is taking off in under an hour. The Next Web confirmed that this was an international update, noticing that the feature appeared in both India, including their ride-hailing service called Ola, and The Netherlands. Don't have Uber, or your city's equivalent? Instead, Google's App will link you to the app store so you can download it. Read more Uber to trial self-driving cars from today At this rate, in a year an Uber will appear at your door before you even know you wanted to go somewhere. No complaints here.

Take a look at the top five new features included in the latest OS. By: Chakri Kudikala Published: Thursday, October 20, 2016, 15:00 [IST] As promised at the launch event of Google Pixel phones, the search giant released the Android Nougat 7.1 Developer Preview to the existing Nexus devices- Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, and Pixel C Tablet. The Android 7.1 update is not new as the Pixel phones are already running it. So, it is widely expected that the developer preview is highly usable as daily driver. SEE ALSO: Good News for Jio Users: Calls Will Remain Free for Life It is worth noticing that not all the features of Android 7.1 will be given to the existing Nexus devices, but most there are some noticeable changes. Here are the top five new features in the Android Nougat 7.1 Developer Preview. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! App Shortcuts! One of the best features introduced with Pixel phones. This feature functions same as the 3D Touch in Apple phones but is very different from the Apple's innovation. Apple built this technology based on the pressure sensitivity, however, Google is just embedding this feature into the OS. The user needs to long press an application in the home screen, which brings a pop up with several options. For example, long pressing the Google Play Music app shows you Recent Activity, My Library, and I'm Feeling lucky options. At this point of time, it is still unknown whether these options are customizable or not.   Restart Option Makes into Power Menu! Finally. The most asked feature by many Android lovers over the time. Google is finally hearing the voice of their audience. The Android Nougat 7.1 Developer Preview comes with a new restart option in the power menu, which is a great deal for many. New Gesture Moves The new developer preview brings the all new gesture features from the Google Pixel phones. These settings can be found under the Settings app. And there are three moves such as the 'Jump to Camera', 'Flip to Camera', and 'Lift to check phone'. All these gestures will work when your device is locked. New Support Tab in Settings App Google is betting hard on the Pixel phone's support as they promised 24/7 support at the launch event. Now, they are bringing the same feature to the Nexus phones as well, which is a great addition, but we haven't tested how it works. Revamped Quick Toggles In the Android Nougat 7.0 update, Google completely refreshed the notifications panel and quick settings and now, the company is slightly modifying the quick toggles department. There are six quick toggles in the notifications shade from the previous five toggles. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

The page reads, “Pixel phones get Android version updates for at least 2 years from when the device became available on the Google Store. After 2 years, we can’t guarantee additional updates.” Users who’ve bought Google’s new Pixel smartphones directly from Google Store will receive the updates within 2 weeks. However, updates may take longer to arrive on devices bought from a mobile carrier or somewhere else. As for security updates, Google will be pushing out updates on a regular basis and these will be automatically downloaded in the background. According to Google support page, the new Google Pixel smartphones will get security patches ‘for at least 3 years from when the device first became available, or at least 18 months from when the Google Store last sold the device, whichever is longer.’ This means that Google Pixel smartphones are expected to get security updates until 2019.

Image: AlexLMX/Shutterstock With the reveal of the Google Pixel a few weeks ago, Nougat became the OS everyone wanted to play with. But who else gets the upgrade? The Android OS is a little odd and quite a reflection of the disparate market it operates in, reaching some devices quickly and others far, far slower. With such interest in Nougat, all eyes are on the where and when. Android Nougat marks version 7.0 of the Google operating system. It was revealed to developers and the world at its latest I/O conference last May, before getting a grand unveiling the month after. Google claims there are more than 250 major features within the operating system, but a few of them definitely stand out. With beta developer versions already out in the wild (7.0 back in August, 7.1 this week), and the final release not due until December, when is your device due the upgrade? Or will it get the upgrade at all? Nexus Nexus was the second earliest in on the act, with beta versions for 7.0 back in August, and 7.1 this week. The Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and Android One will lead the way at each stage. The full upgrade is imminent, it seems. Sony Sony itself revealed that it would make Nougat available for: Xperia Z3+, Xperia Z4 Tablet, Xperia Z5, Xperia Z5 Compact, Xperia Z5 Premium, Xperia X, Xperia XA, Xperia XA Ultra, Xperia X Performance, Xperia XZ and Xperia X Compact. This could come as early as next week, though later this year is probably more likely. The Nougat 7.1 beta timeline is a little less clear, but it’s safe to say the above will be involved. Samsung Samsung’s Nougat relationship is a little spoiled at the moment, with the Galaxy Note7 originally released as a Nougat flagship before the flag burned and the ship sank. As Android Authority explains, due to the five-month delay between official release and Samsung adoption of the last major Android software update, January or February look to be the best bet. Other Samsung devices in line for both beta and full releases are the Galaxy S7/S7 Edge, Galaxy S6/S6 Edge, Note 5 and Note 4. Others in the J, A and S range rumoured to be getting Nougat updates are available here. HTC HTC is actually lined up for one of the earlier roll-outs of Nougat, after it was commissioned to help build this year’s Nexus devices. The inside look means HTC’s Nougat beta implementation is expected this month, with HTC One A9, HTC One M9 and HTC 10 expected to get in on the act as early as this December. So sweet.

The Mate 8 wasn’t upgraded to Marshmallow, but was released with it as basic, just weeks after the official reveal. Huawei moves so fast that a beta preview of Nougat for the Huawei P9 appeared a month before Google officially released it for Nexus devices, though little has moved since. OnePlus The popular OnePlus series – exclusively positioned in the premium market – has a future of Nougat ahead. Rumours are already growing that the OnePlus 4 will have Nougat 7.0 as built-in software, with the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 2 eventually getting an upgrade. As yet no date has emerged, though. Nougat.

By Nick Heath | October 20, 2016 -- 08:02 GMT (01:02 PDT) | Topic: Cloud The new tiers in Google Cloud Storage. Image: Google Google has refreshed its cloud storage offerings, introducing new tiers at a lower price. The Google Cloud Storage platform will now offer four types of storage: Multi-regional, Regional, Nearline and Coldline. Each offers availability and pricing aimed at different use cases, from streaming media to disaster recovery. Coldline is a new Google Cloud Storage tier, aimed at data accessed less than once per year. It is the lowest-priced offering, at 0.7 cents per GB per month with a five cent per GB access fee, and designed for disaster recovery and long-term archival. Google says it offers fast data access for a cold-storage option, describing it as offering access in milliseconds, the same as the other tiers. In terms of cold-storage pricing, the release of Coldline puts Google on a par with AWS, which already has Amazon Glacier at 0.7 cents per GB per month. Google retains its Nearline storage tier, which it describes as suited to data accessed infrequently, for example, for backup or rarely-accessed documents. Access costs one cent per GB per month. The Multi-Regional tier stores data in multiple regions worldwide, providing redundancy in case of a regional outage, as well as local caches of data to reduce latency when serving content to users spread across the globe. Storage costs $0.026 per GB per month and the option is available in the US, EU, and Asia. All existing Standard storage buckets in a multi-regional location have been converted to the Multi-Regional storage tier. Finally, Google Cloud Storage regional is designed for users who need storage to feed Google's cloud compute services, such as Google Compute Engine or Google Cloud Machine Learning, within a specific region. Google says it is suited to high-throughput workloads, such as data transcoding or big-data analytics. Storage costs $0.02 per GB per month. All existing Standard storage buckets in a regional location have been converted to the Regional storage tier, a change which Google says equates to a 23 percent price reduction, effective from November 1. API operations pricing will also be reduced from November 1 for Multi-Regional and Regional storage tiers, with class A operations costing $0.005 per 1,000 operations, a 50 percent reduction, and Class B costing $0.004 per 10,000 operations, a 60 percent reduction. These new storage classes will be integrated with offerings from various Google Cloud Storage partners, including Fastly, Veritas, Cloudian, Cloudberry Lab, Komprise, StorReduce, Cohesity and Sureline.

Automakers and Google raised a litany of concerns about California’s proposal at a hearing in Sacramento on Wednesday. They expressed opposition to the state proposal to require compliance with guidelines that federal regulators issued last month, but made voluntary. They questioned why California would require a new autonomous vehicle data recorder and what data they would be required to test, and they objected to a proposal they said would force a 12-month delay between testing a vehicle and deploying it on public roads. Automakers also questioned whether police should be able to get any self-driving data within 24 hours without seeking a warrant or subpoena. California regulatory policy is important to automakers and technology companies because of its impact on operations in the state, and because the policies enacted in the most populous U.S. state often influence what other states and other countries do. The proposed requirement that manufacturers generate a year of driverless testing data before applying for an operating permit drew objections from General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Honda Motor Co (7267.T), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and Google. The state’s approach “could greatly delay the benefits that self-driving vehicles can bring to safety and mobility for individuals,” said David Strickland, who heads the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets that includes Google, Ford, Lyft, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Volvo Car Group. Brian Soublet, deputy director of the California DMV, said Wednesday the department wants concrete suggestions to help improve its proposal. Soublet said the department will be considering potential changes over the next several months but he did not give a timetable for finalizing the rules. “The goal is making sure that we can get this life-saving technology out on the streets,” Soublet said. California’s proposal would allow for the absence of a human driver and a steering wheel in advanced self-driving cars. In December, California had proposed to require licensed drivers and controls in self-driving vehicles. Ron Medford, director of safety for Google’s self-driving car project, said California’s proposal to require manufacturers to obtain local approval is “unworkable.” The rule could prevent manufacturers from testing a vehicle that can travel from one area to another. Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog urged California to prohibit autonomous vehicles without a human driver until federal regulators enact enforceable standards.
