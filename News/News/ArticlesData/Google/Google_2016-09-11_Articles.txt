A new Google site prominently lists how many URLs Google has removed — 1.75 billion so far. Previously reporters had to compile such data themeselves. Watch Live You can also browse how few requests were actually denied. Around 40 million takedown requests were rejected, which is 2.1 percent of the total requests. Another 16 million requests were duplicates. These numbers are astronomical. It’s staggering how many requests Google has to process, and every request faces a four-step process: Copyright owners send takedown notices for “allegedly infringing material” Google reviews the request, and complies if there aren’t issues with it. Google sends a notification to the owner of the de-listed content. The owner can file a counter-notification, either by making an argument or removing the offending content. Google decides whether or not to add the page in question back to search results. Play around with the tool now; this isn’t a new feature, but it’s fascinating. You can, for example, see how many requests a given company has made. RIAA-member companies requested over 80 million URLs removed. You can also see how many requests companies have made for particular domains. ThePirateBay.se has faced over 4 million such requests, and that’s just in the short time the infamous pirate site used that particular domain name.

Back then we were still referring to the devices as Nexus devices because that’s what they’ve been called all these years, but more recently we found out that Google could actually be rebranding them to Pixel handsets. This is why it isn’t surprising to learn that according to Android ROM developer LlabTooFeR, Google has recently made some changes to the launcher and have renamed it from the Nexus Launcher to the Pixel Launcher (via Android Police), for reasons which we guess are pretty obvious since it looks like Google could be slowly doing away with the Nexus brand. Other than the name change, visually it does not appear to be too different from the previous version. It does sport a new icon and according to the version shown in the screenshot, it says that it is version 7.1, which coincidentally enough is also the version of Nougat that the Pixel phones are said to be launching with. In any case this is best taken with a grain of salt for now, but Google is rumored to make the phones (both the Pixel and Pixel XL) official on the 4th of October, so check back with us in the coming weeks for confirmation of the event.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Don’t Miss Out: How to Use Google’s New Mobile Testing Tool Mobile Search August 1, 2016 Mobile Search Amanda DiSilvestroAugust 1, 2016 VIP CONTRIBUTOR 820SHARES 2.1KREADS 820SHARES 2.1KREADS VIP CONTRIBUTORAmanda DiSilvestro 820SHARES 2.1KREADS Google’s original mobile testing tool came out in 2014, and two years in the land of technology might as well be a lifetime. It was about time they came out with an update, and I’m happy to say it was worth the wait. According to Google, “people are five times more likely to leave a mobile site that isn’t mobile-friendly,” and “nearly half of all visitors will leave a mobile site if the pages don’t load within 3 seconds.” In other, more blatant words, it’s imperative that business owners optimize their sites for mobile. Read below to find out how to use the newest version of Google’s mobile testing tool and make sure your website is meeting the needs of your mobile customers. How to Get the New Google Mobile Testing Tool First things first: you can access the tool from Google’s Search Console’s mobile usability report. Either way, once you’ve arrived at the tool, it’s as simple as entering your website’s URL into the search box, clicking “test now”, and waiting for the results. The home screen will look something like this: Then, once you enter a URL, your results page will look something like this: How to Interpret the Google Mobile Testing Tool Results So now you know how to access the tool (it’s pretty self-explanatory and easy to use, thanks to Google!). Next, you need to know what those results mean. A test is worthless if you can’t use the results to make positive improvements. In terms of the screenshot above, Google makes it pretty clear that the site is mobile friendly. The big green 99/100 rating for mobile friendliness is a pretty big giveaway. If you’re not looking for an in-depth analysis of your site, this might be just enough information to make you happy and send you on your way. However, you’d be missing out on some of the tool’s (not-so-hidden) features that could help improve your mobile site even more. You’ll notice in the shot above that next to the mobile friendliness rating are ratings for mobile and desktop speed. Although Express scored high in the overall rating, they didn’t fare so well when it came to speed. This is just one example of the added information you get with the newest version of this tool. If this was my site and my ratings, the first thing I’d work on fixing would be the speed of my site on both mobile and desktop. One of the big differences between the old version of the tool and the updated version is that you now have access to this added information; in the past, all the tool said was whether or not your site was mobile friendly. Now, users have much more detailed information in the form of a 0-100-scale rating that discusses mobile friendliness, but also mobile and desktop speed. Additional Features of the Google Mobile Testing Tool Besides the new rating scale and the fact that you can get all three scores on one screen, Google has made another big change; they give you the option to have a comprehensive report sent to you that you can share with your team. If you click that button, a screen will appear that looks something like this: Google is nice enough to give you some mobile tips in an easy-to-read, easy-to-understand format even before receiving your free report (which they promise will arrive within 24 hours). Here is a report that I had sent to me for amandadisilvestro.com: You can see that in the area where I scored poorly (mobile speed), Google tells me exactly what needs to be fixed. They even provide links that lead to technical support in case the team needs help fixing the problem. They’re pretty much taking the guesswork out of the whole thing, so truly optimizing a mobile site has never been this painless. Possible Critiques of the Google Mobile Testing Tool I do think it is interesting, and worth noting, that while there is a ton of information out there about how the tool works and how to use it, there isn’t a lot of information that explains the algorithm the tool uses in order to determine the three different ratings. All I was really able to determine was that it looks at things like CSS, HTML, scripts, and images and then evaluates how quickly (or slowly) it takes for your website to load. So how do they determine where your site falls on the rating scale? Perhaps by how long it takes for your site to load past the 3-second mark, which they claim is the attention span people have for waiting on mobile sites. (Ironically enough, it takes longer than three seconds for Google’s site to complete its test.) I became even more skeptical after coming across this article by Search Engine Watch. They did some more extensive tests and found that their site, along with Forbes, and many other sites, all received “poor” ratings for both mobile and desktop speed. In fact, the only site they could find that received good scores in all three categories was Google. When I did the test myself, I received the same results, as you can see below: I hate to be a skeptic and go around touting a conspiracy theory, but what’s up with that Google? Are all the other mobile sites out there really inferior to yours, or are you just trying to drum up business for your new tool? Regardless of the critiques or potential fishy-ness happening, the tool is easy to use and is something I would recommend. After all, it’s free, and if you truly don’t believe what you see, then you don’t have to make any changes. If nothing else, it gets you thinking. What do you think of Google’s new tool? Was your site able to score a “good” in more than one category?

I just get a big green ‘This page seems mobile-friendly’ like the one in the earlier SEJ article: https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-launches-new-mobile-friendly-testing-tool/164075/ Am I in the wrong place? You say access it from the Search Console Mobile Usability tool, but don’t give the final url. Is it https://search.google.com/search-console/mobile-friendly? As for the detailed analysis, I’ve traditionally got it from the Page Speed Insights tool. https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ So if anyone else is having issues, try that one.

The Chinese will add billions more to this pool. We are the third hottest start-up nation in the world—just behind the US and UK, with over 4,000 start-ups. Facebook, Google and WhatsApp are betting big on India. Our mobile penetration has crossed the billion mark. We’ve got 300 million smartphones, and growing. By all counts, we should be happily dreaming of multibillion-dollar initial public offerings and a vibrant exit system. Yet we are not. Look under the hood—you see a crisis of confidence today. Venture capitalists (VCs) have pulled back. Series A funding is at an all-time low and “consolidation” is the nickname for the desperate rescue of investors in dud start-ups, which are quietly euthanized a few months later. Across logistics, e-commerce, food tech and hyper-local services, several hyped-up Western clones have been decimated. A deadpool list puts the number at 800 but my hunch is that this could be double that. In excess of $2 billion has evaporated over the last 12 months—with nothing to show for it, except jobless techies, sales people, coordinators and courier boys. Over 10,000 pink slips have been issued in the last six months, not counting the losses at ancillary businesses that sprang up around them. Founders have realized that raising lots of money is not the recipe for success. In the last five years the exact opposite happened: mega-funding killed the innovation and hunger, the leanness and the sharpness. It created sprawling teams without focus. Investors were blinded by the growth story and did very little diligence on teams and their maturity to find product-market fit. Funding became the distraction. The biggest startups in India fell complacent by their own admission. Mega-funding rounds ended up attracting foreign strategic competitors like Amazon and Uber far earlier than planned. Flipkart and Snapdeal are estimated to have burnt through $3.5 billion so far to generate gross merchandise value of $5.5 billion this year. If you assume their “take rate” at about 8% (commission revenues they derive from a transaction on their marketplace) their generated revenue will be just about $400 million. This kind of capital inefficiency boggles the mind. So, here’s the moot point: Did something go terribly wrong at the confluence of young start-up founders, mega-round capital and proven business ideas? Or was the huge market potential in the Indian Internet space a chimera? There are two parts to this narrative: start-ups hitting a glass ceiling and the fallacy of “one” market. Let’s take them one by one. 1. The glass ceiling: A year ago e-commerce players realised that they had exhausted their “consumer runway”. There was a limit to the number of Indians who speak English, have money for data packs and have the personal disposable income to fill their closets with clothes they don’t need based on offers they can’t resist. The returns on customer acquisition and retention costs were negative, and splurging on ads did not expand the customer pool. This math was conveniently ignored because they had to show higher gross merchandise value to attract investors. But there were other troubling signs too. When they cut back discounts due to changes in government policy, e-commerce shipments tanked across the board. Smartphone growth, an indicator for the potential of our consumer Internet market, slowed to just 17%. Telecom operators reported slowing data pack growth for the first time in years. There is a growing realization that the Indian market is not as deep as they thought. Almost on cue, the narrative shifted from “India will be the next China” to “India is not China.”Does this mean the market is small? Not at all. 2. The fallacy of ‘one’ market: Google, Facebook, WhatsApp are huge, ubiquitous services with over 95% penetration in our market. They will soon reach a majority of our potentially billion-strong Internet users—most of these new users will rely on their smartphones for digital access. But these services are free. They make money from advertisers and not consumers. And their average revenue per user (ARPU) in India is a mere fraction of their global average. So it’s not that our market is small, but the way it is configured that trips up every player who tries to treat it as “one” market. The multinational companies and big-box retailers in India learnt these lessons the hard way a decade ago and now we are seeing the tech startups face up to the reality. The reason to worry is this: most Indians cannot afford a decent meal, let alone buying stuff online or hailing an on-demand cab. Let’s turn to the math. If you stacked up a 100 Indians, here’s how our income distribution looks: One Indian earns 30% of the total and makes over Rs1.5 lakh a month. Fourteen Indians earn 30% of the total and make around Rs20,000 a month each. The next 30 Indians earn 30% of the total and make Rs8,000 per month each. The poorest 55 Indians earn 10% of the total and make only Rs1,500 per month each. Mind you, this is total income. This is money they earn to spend on everything—roti, kapada and makaan, and of course, data. Most of this money is spent on food and groceries, and on things they “need”. Money left over to buy things they “want” is much lower as you go down the chain. The wealth statistics are even more damning: One Indian owns 53% of the wealth Nine Indians own 23% of the wealth Forty Indians own 20% of the wealth Fifty Indians at the bottom own only 4.1% of the total (Note: These are rough calculations and I abstain from using the phrase “Indian middle class”. There is just too much confusion around how big it is.) Simply put, we live in three countries: India One: Club the top two tiers above and you find that the top 15% of Indians, i.e. about 150-180 million, earning an average of Rs30,000 per month, are the ones who have money left over after buying necessities. These 15% of Indians control over half the spending power of the economy and almost its entire discretionary spending. They consume their data plans without thinking about the bills. They install the shiny new apps without bothering about the gigabytes they consume on their oversized and expensive smartphones. They have Wi-Fi at home and office, power generators at home and are connected 24x7. They are equivalent to a country with the population of Canada and live the lifestyle of a European nation (if you equate them on purchasing power parity, or PPP basis)—and with better lifestyle to boot. They have chauffeurs, maids, cooks, cleaners, peons to take care of onerous chores. And no, they won’t step out of their air-conditioned homes into our dirty streets and traffic—everything has to be served instantly, at home. Assisted living at the age of 20, I call it. India Two: This is the middle 30% or 400-odd million Indians, earning an average of Rs7,000 a month. This would be a country about three times the size of Bangladesh with a similar level of purchasing power. They are the ones who “service” the $1 trillion market (yes, read that again) that India One represents. That’s the money that trickles down to them. They have managed to change their fate and climb out of poverty over the last two decades by migrating from their tiny bits of non-arable land to the mega cities of India and taken up jobs to serve the needs of these markets. They work two shifts as Uber/Ola drivers or as cooks in our burgeoning restaurant chains, or set up small businesses—and send money back home to their families in the villages. Luckily for us, they still see hard work, family values and education as a ticket to a better future. Most save all their money to get their kids an education. Most of their income is spent on food and rent, and whatever little is left they use to try and escape from life in their smartphone screens by buying movies or songs on an SD card from the neighbourhood store. They buy second-hand smartphones and tiny sub-hundred rupee data packs to keep in touch. Of course, we report them as Internet consumers in our slick presentations on Startup India. India Three: These are the forgotten 650 million who subsist and don’t have the money to buy two square meals. Their incomes are on par with those of sub-Saharan Africa. Many of them did not leave our roadless, school-less, toilet-less, and powerless villages and instead chose to send a child or a sibling to work in the big cities. They live on the mercy of our monsoon and whatever little reaches them through our poverty alleviation programmes. They live on the periphery of our economy and for all practical purposes don’t participate in it. However, they are the ones who form our vote banks and determine the political future of our nation. These three Indias are not split geographically. The steady urbanization of our nation has seen to it that all three mingle together in our metropolises—from Dharavi to Dadar to Malabar Hill in a city like Mumbai. We share the same roads, air pollution, and same GSM spectrum from our favourite cellphone operator. What joins our existence at the hip is the cellphone and the constant fear of its battery running out. Failure of the smartphone proxy The failure to distinguish between “Internet users” (India Two) and “Internet consumers” (India One) has messed up every estimate of the market. This destroyed the Total Addressable Market (TAM) calculations that have driven most venture capital funding and valuations. TAM—of people who can afford to actually habitually spend on the current offerings of our Internet giants—is not 1 billion people, it is about 150 million people. This changes things. Let’s see how. E-commerce players talk about how their penetration levels are low and they have a huge upside. But the moment you redefine the addressable base—i.e. assume it’s not 250 million households but closer to 40-50 million with discretionary income—our online shopping penetration suddenly rivals the best markets in the world. It is obvious that with so much media blitzkrieg and mind-boggling discounting, most of the households that could afford to make online shopping a habit have converted. The market has saturated, and growth will slow. Quite simply, investors and founders who took our explosive mobile and smartphone growth as a proxy for the potential of our consumer Internet market are paying the price. The bubbles are not just in their valuations but in the business models that assumed a far larger addressable market than there is. So how does one look at the market today? First recognize that the smartphone is not an indicator of spending power, it is an instrument for survival. Almost 60% of Internet users in India don’t access it more than once a day. These are not Internet consumers, but just Internet users—they use it like a utility, with an eye on the data consumption. The addressable market for a start-up will now need to be tested for real. Someone will have to go and check on the ground whether the customer can actually afford it, repeatedly, or will it be a one-time sign-up driven by the incentive of a free Rs20 talktime recharge—something that sounds pretty good to someone living on a data plan of Rs100 a month. If anything this “reset” augurs well for our future. The golden moment for India’s Internet market is coming. VC dollars will now naturally get directed towards India Two and India Three. But they need a different mindset and solutions. They may not live up to the script of I-will-be-a-unicorn-in-24-months, but will have the potential to give birth to several “centaurs” for the next decade. What will aid them is the fact that the country is about to get data-charged. We will add 200 million smartphone customers as smartphone prices dip below Rs3,000. Reliance Jio’s entry will reset data prices in India. My guess is that entry-level data packs will cost a third of what they are sold for today—in just a few months. And wired broadband, which has been ignored far too long by our successive governments, will take off finally. A 10% increase in broadband penetration increases the per capita GDP by 1.38% in developing countries, according to the World Bank. India ranks No. 4 on smartphone ownership, but 122 on broadband. Access to cheap, good-quality bandwidth will make vernacular and video the accessible language of digital interaction. Data will be the new arterial network of India. Cheap Internet access and low-priced smartphones, combined with the public digital goods (the identity and trust layer provided by the India Stack) being built around Aadhaar, and a maturing startup ecosystem will create the next set of uniquely Indian technology start-ups. India Stack will craft a new friction-free, lower-transaction-cost highway that will be accessible on the mobiles of Indians regardless of their income and literacy. It will create a truly integrated market. A year ago, I had tweeted that there is a billion dollar opportunity in building your business on this platform. Though we pride ourselves as a country of entrepreneurs, we make a big mistake. Most of our self-employed in India are entrepreneurs by default for lack of other opportunities. They work in small shops and farms, often in poor conditions. They lack the capital and tools to grow and are forever stuck in the uncertainty of self-employment and the vagaries of the market and weather. These sub-scale firms that barely sustain the livelihood of one family are a drain on our economy and resources. We have to de-clog from millions of tiny businesses and get employment going. As India Two and India Three go online, the people who could not participate in the economy due to lack of physical and financial infrastructure, will turn into consumers and “micro-entrepreneurs”. The kind of entrepreneurs I am talking about will embrace technology and the connected ecosystem to scale their business, creating wealth and jobs. This is the Green Revolution, the Milk Revolution at 100x the scale and impact—something that has never been seen in any market in the world. So what does it mean for VCs and start-ups? The traditional VC model bets on a few winners and deep markets, which are quickly penetrated by access to mobile-connected audiences and are mega-funded to disrupt traditional markets. Indian VCs will need to balance a “nurture and grow” versus a “spray, burn and pray”. In China, Internet retailing grew 50x in the seven-year period 2007-2014 on the back of 7x growth in user adoption and 7x growth in annual spending on e-commerce. In 2014, China had 10x the number of middle-income households compared with India. We can’t catch up with that anytime soon. That kind of growth is still 10 years (or more?) away in India. So VCs need to recalibrate their thinking. Of course, you may find a startup with great product-market fit, but the viscosity and the shallowness of the Indian market will slow you down. So you have to have the patience to see it achieve scale. Start-ups will have to play the game very differently. First, they have to recognize that India One will remain hyper-competitive with the global players always ready to jump in. This market needs start-ups that tailor their offerings to these audiences who value convenience over economy. Here the challenge would be to drive both usage and ticket size. This will be a tough market to fight. There is an opportunity in India’s traditional businesses. Every sector has infirmities and yawning gaps that a start-up can drive a truck through. Most Indian old-economy companies are caught like deer in headlights—every CEO wants an app or a website but few have a clue on how to make it a real business. A quick glance at the websites of the offline retailers will tell you that even after they were hit by the online tsunami over three years ago, they’ve yet to put up a semblance of a fight. There’s a huge opportunity here. Winning here won’t guarantee that you will still be relevant in a few years’ time, since you’ll miss the benefits of scale if you ignore the India Two and India Three markets. We need a “Nirma moment” in our start-ups. And the Nirma moment does not strike you while you sit in the cozy quarters of Koramangala. The consumer Internet businesses for India Two and Three will have a different agenda—they will need to focus on reducing costs and friction, and not just on overloading the consumer with choice. So how can one frame the opportunities? While it’ll be most interesting to get the reader’s take on it, I’ve tried to bucket them into three types: 1. Bridging the divide: These are firms that would build the bridge between India One and India Two—that rework their offerings to match the aspirations and affordability of India Two. Who can refurbish goods, sell more affordable unbranded products, and communicate with the India Two consumers in their language. Group-buying platforms for consumers and small and medium enterprises, second-hand cars and two-wheelers are some examples. A player like ShopClues is the Indian dollar store or the flea market has made a dent here. 2. Create new markets: Start-ups need to learn how to “sachetise”—how to strip down ideas and services and match the affordability and aspirations of India Two. For instance, they need predictable and cheap transport. Can’t we create a bike-hailing service, like Go-Jek in Indonesia? 3. Inform, empower and entertain: India Three customers need start-ups that can disintermediate exploitative middlemen. For example, “direct to farmer” m-commerce platforms like AgroStar. They need apps that can make a village act as one and increase their collective bargaining power. They need information apps that can help them choose the right crop, do the right investment, take care of their health and fitness, lead a better life. These are lessons for founders: A big round of funding doesn’t translate to success. Ingenuity comes first. If you get that right, the funding ecosystem is now large and deep enough to back you as you scale. Get fascinated with India Two and Three for the next five years. You can create moats and stickiness in these markets. They are first-time Internet consumers. They need guidance and solutions that can transform their lives. You don’t have to go far to understand their needs; they live next door, in the chawls of your city. Learn from Patanjali as much as you learn from Amazon and maybe you’ll truly find the pot of gold beneath our pyramid. Every start-up doesn’t have to be a unicorn. No need to burn up like the legendary Icarus as he affixed wings made of wax which melted when he tried to embrace the Sun. I’d say, instead work on growing real wings and soaring—they take time to grow, and the journey is longer, but they won’t melt at the first sign of heat.

Photo: AP San Francisco: Chris Urmson, the mild-mannered robotics expert who ran Google’s self-driving car project, used to say that when his son reached driving age in 2019, the technology would be available so the teenager wouldn’t have to take a driving test. In August, less than a year after auto industry veteran John Krafcik took the helm of the project, Urmson left with much work remaining: Google has yet to launch an autonomous vehicle service for the public. Other top technologists have also departed and progress has been slow. Once considered a leader in the field, Google has lost its first-mover advantage to other companies pursuing more practical, less-ambitious self-driving car services, said former members of the project and other people familiar with the situation. They asked not to be identified because details of the effort are private. “They need a partner, a sales force, a strategy,” said Roger Lanctot, associate director of Strategy Analytics’ Global Automotive Practice. Google’s project started in 2009, long before car makers and most other companies seriously considered the technology. But when Singapore unveiled the first autonomous taxi service in August, Google wasn’t involved. Instead, a small start-up called nuTonomy provided the technology. Uber Technologies Inc., founded in 2009, will soon let users of its popular ride-sharing app hail autonomous Volvo SUVs in Pittsburgh. Google has driven more than 1.8 million miles in tests on public roads in a bid to perfect its software to handle difficult situations, such as driving in snow. Tesla Motors Inc. already offers partially autonomous features in more than 70,000 of its electric cars, and Otto, a start-up run by former Google car project members, is developing a self-driving system for trucks on highways, an easier technological challenge than the one Google faces. Uber acquired Otto in July. “Google still has an imperfect system and no clear path to go to market,” said Ajay Juneja, chief executive of Speak With Me Inc., which offers voice recognition and related technology for cars, watches and other connected devices. “How exactly would they have shipped something by now?” This is part of a broader challenge Google parent Alphabet Inc. faces turning research projects into profitable businesses. The company is more cautious about rolling out new technology early, after its Glass Internet-connected eyewear flopped, according to one of the people. There’s also a higher bar now for projects as chief financial officer Ruth Porat has said she requires clearer paths to profitability before approving more funding or expansion. Possibly the biggest drag on programme is the sheer scope of Google’s ambitions. Its aim is to revolutionize transportation through full autonomy. The software must be trained thoroughly to handle all eventualities. Meanwhile, there are already methods to make self-driving cars good, rather than perfect. That has helped companies including Uber, Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, Tesla and Volvo Car Group catch up with Google, Juneja said. Uber’s service, which is tied to the smartphones of drivers and passengers, can generate a lot more driving data, an essential ingredient to quickly train the artificial intelligence software needed to guide self-driving vehicles, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a recent research note. “Uber logs as many miles in 24 minutes as Google’s autonomous cars have logged in their existence,” they wrote. “While none of these miles are fully autonomous today, we just point out the scale of experience that can accelerate the development of the AI, mapping and learning for autonomous cars.” With thousands of Internet-connected cars on the road, Tesla has a similar data advantage, one former member of the Google car project said. The two main ways for Google to commercialize the technology are by including Chauffeur, the name for its self-driving software, in cars made in high volume by existing auto manufacturers, or through a popular ride-sharing service that could slowly replace a human-driven fleet with automated vehicles, industry experts said. Google has neither of these yet. It struck a deal in May with Fiat Chrysler, but only to put its software in 100 minivans. Talks with other car companies, such as Ford Motor Co., have yet to produce high-volume deals. And many car companies are pursuing their own self-driving strategies. General Motors Co. bought self-driving software start-up Cruise Automation in March and invested $500 million in ride-sharing service Lyft Inc., gaining two important ingredients for an autonomous vehicle service. A Google unit invested in Uber in 2013, sparking speculation its self-driving software would automate Uber rides. But Uber is building its own autonomous technology now. Google is planning to expand a ride-sharing service built around its Waze navigation app, however that will only be in San Francisco later this year, while Uber and Lyft cover most major US cities. “I think they would rather enable than do,” said Lanctot, of Strategy Analytics. “As enabler, they can work with all, rather than become a competitive target.” Slow progress caused frustration among some members of the Google car project, and that’s been exacerbated by early momentum of rivals that entered the race later, according to former members of the team and a person familiar with the situation. The team knew what it would take to deliver a fully-autonomous system, known in the industry as L4, but some Google executives didn’t understand the complexity, according to one former member. The person left to help run an active business with paying customers, something that’s missing from the car project. A Google spokesman declined to comment for this story.

Contrary to Coalition suggestion that they would find the crossbenchers easier to negotiate with, this coming together clears the way for Labor and the Coalition to do more deals down the track. You can argue over the specific policy items – such as cuts to Arena – but in my opinion the signs of compromise are a good thing. It breaks the deadlock on the shocking tribalism that inhabited the 43rd parliament under Tony Abbott as opposition leader. It clears the way for more centrist policies. It also is an acknowledgement that oppositions, present and future, can take part constructively in policy formulation. Labor thanked the Coalition. The Coalition thanked Labor. The future of the plebiscite remains in doubt, notwithstanding the Coalition cabinet and party room ticking off on public funding for the yes and no cases, a committee system to dole out the funding and a date: February 11. Labor still hasn’t said whether it will vote against the plebiscite legislation even though it doesn’t support the poll and said it could cause suicides. The Liberal senator Dean Smith has flagged he could not support the plebiscite bill. Late today, the parliament was arguing about the standing orders. These are the parliamentary rules. Labor has accused the Coalition of trying to change the rules after it lost the votes on September one. Christopher Pyne, leader of the house, says it is no such thing – the recommendations came from previous committee reports. I am going to have to leave it there ... Thanks to the brains trust Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy and Gareth Hutchens. Mikey Bowers, take a bow. Thanks to readers too for all your help. All the contributions are gratefully accepted.

The events of September 1 – as we call them on this side of the House – had no bearing on the changes to standing order 132. He first proposed them in August, says Pyne. All the way along I have tried to show my cooperation, says Pyne. Albo shouts: “your a saint!” It’s not often the member for Grayndler calls me a saint ... We want the 45th parliament to be good for Australia. Pyne is justifying the convention of “misadventure” for MPs who miss votes as part of the changes. This would make certain allowances if members miss a division. Pyne cites the example of a MP in the past who had got “stuck in facilities” in the parliament. He explains that the MP got stuck because he thought it was a “push-pull door” rather than a sliding door. The Speaker asked him to come to the point. Pyne admits to digressing. He suggests Albo often distracts him. (I do love these two and their parliamentary parrying. It’s worth remembering they are friends and Pyne recently attended the launch of Albo’s biography.)

I remember the group hug when Christopher Pyne on behalf of the opposition signed the agreement for a better parliament. Albo is pointing out the difference between the 43rd parliament and this one. We didn’t lose a vote in three years of a hung parliament, says Albo. This mob didn’t survive three days. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.56am EDT 02:56 You may remember all those hours ago, Tony Burke opposed some of these changes. Labor and the crossbenchers wrote to the government with some other changes but Pyne hangs out a carrot. He says he will do the government ones first and then afterwards, he will consider the non-government ones. These are the Labor/crossbench suggestions: Briefly, we propose the following amendments to the Standing Orders: 1) Returning the membership of the Selection Committee to five Government Members, three Labor Members, two crossbench Members and the Speaker (or Deputy Speaker)as Chair; 2) Returning the power of the Selection Committee to recommend items of Private Members’ Business to be voted on; 3) Returning supplementary questions to Question Time; 4) Adopting a 10-minute Responses to Ministers’ answers or a so-called ‘take note’ session following Question Time for any Member to respond to answers given during Question Time for a maximum of 90 seconds; 5) Allowing the crossbench question during Question Time to have a time limit of 45 seconds instead of 30 seconds; and 6) Other amendments consistent with previous Standing Orders. Opposition manager Tony Burke says Christopher Pyne is only trying to change the rules because the government’s MPs missed the vote in the last sitting week. The leader of the house had a humiliation last Thursday and he is trying to promise the prime minister it will not happen again.

Last year, Google partnered with Disney on a StarWars-themed virtual reality experience just for Google Cardboard. As if that wasn't cool enough, Google then gave its its Cardboard users a new camera app capable of capturing something called "VR photos". That app, called Cardboard Camera, can also record sound for VR photos, and it's now available for iPhone users too. Here's everything we know so far about the Android and iOS app. Google Cardboard: What is it? Google launched Cardboard in 2014. Cardboard gives you a rich virtual reality experience without the big price tag. It's basically a cardboard do-it-yourself kit that turns into a VR headset. Your iPhone or Android smartphone provides the headset with a display and processing power, as well as access to VR content from app stores. There are also Cardboard rivals available, and some are certified to work with Cardboard apps. Google Cardboard: What is Cardboard Camera? It is a new camera app for Android and iPhone, and it works specifically with Google Cardboard. The idea is that - with Cardboard Camera - your smartphone will turn into a virtual reality camera. Cardboard Camera can capture something called "VR photos", which are basically three-dimensional panoramas, with slightly different views for each eye. Google Cardboard: How do you take VR photos? Google Because VR photos are comprised of slightly different views for each eye, things will look both near and far away, thus creating a 3D-like effect. To take a VR photo: open the Cardboard Camera app, then tap the capture button, and hold out your phone. Be sure to move your phone around you in a circle to grab all sorts of angles. You can even record sound, adding another layer of dimension to the whole immersive experience. To capture a VR photo with Cardboard Camera, hold your phone vertically, tap record, then turn around as though you’re taking a panorama. Google Cardboard: How do you view VR photos? Google Slot your phone into the Cardboard headset in order to view the VR photo. The headset basically lets you explore the new type of image in all directions. Simples! Also, starting 12 September, you can also share your VR photos with friends and family on both iPhone and Android devices. Just select multiple photos to create a virtual photo album, tap the share icon, and Cardboard Camera will generate a link that can be emailed, messaged, or posted in apps and on the web, according to Google. Of course, your friends will need a Cardboard-certified viewer to see your VR photos. Google Cardboard: When will Cardboard Camera be out? Cardboard Camera is now available in Google Play Store and Apple's App Store. It's free to download and use. Google Cardboard: Does Cardboard Camera work with other VR headsets? Yes, it does. Here's a list of all the Cardboard-certified viewers available. Pocket-lint has this round-up of all the best Cardboard rivals, as well. Want to know more?

 Facebook just rubbed one of Google's biggest missed opportunities in its face Jillian D'Onfro Sep. 12, 2016, 5:39 PM 27,643 facebook linkedin twitter email print David Marcus Facebook Using Facebook Messenger instead of one of Google's chat apps is a "no-brainer," David Marcus, Facebook's VP of messaging products, said during a Q&A session at TechCrunch's Disrupt Conference on Monday.   While Facebook's chat app, Messenger, has more than 1 billion monthly users, Google lacks a super-popular messaging app and Marcus highlighted that missed opportunity on stage: "If you look at the SMS experience on Android for instance, it's kind of a no-brainer to want to use Messenger, because the experience is so much better than traditional SMS clients on Android — you can do so much more," Marcus said. He has a point. If you buy an Android phone, there's a chance it comes with one or all of a handful different messaging apps for SMS messaging: your carrier's custom chat app, your phone maker's custom app, Google Hangouts for GChats and SMS, and Google Messenger. Because Android is an open-source platform, Google doesn't have the same control over the default SMS app like Apple does with iMessage. Yet on top of that, neither the Android-only Messenger or the multi-platform Hangouts are showstoppers. iMessage and Facebook Messenger have had a well-publicized stream of new features, but these Google products haven't had any significant updates recently. Instead, Google decided to dedicate resources to launching two new messaging apps — Duo for video chatting and Allo, a "smart" chat app that should be hitting app stores soon. Allo integrates in-line suggestions (like for recipes or places to eat) and could stop the existential threat of bots and other smart assistants pulling people off Google search. But even if Allo is as amazing as Google hyped it to be in May, it won't be able to integrate SMS messages like Hangouts, a spokesperson tells us, which could make its adoption curve steeper. And Duo has already seen sagging rankings in both the iOS and Play Stores. Although Google is ostensibly still working on another messaging initiative (a next-generation SMS standard that requires carrier cooperation) that's still a ways-away. Meanwhile, Facebook Messenger has been trying to swoop in. Earlier this year, it started allowing Android users to get their SMS text messages through its app, in a bid to become the main way you text on Android phones.  The most important thing a messaging app needs to be successful, Marcus points out, is reach. Ideally, you'll be able to communicate with everyone you want in one place. Marcus's larger point was that Messenger will only truly succeed when it's on every smartphone but by dragging Google's messaging apps, he got a good burn in in the meantime. Plus, unless Allo becomes wildly popular when it launches in the next few weeks, he has a point about Messenger being the best option for cross-OS communication on Android.  SEE ALSO: Larry Page's grand plan for Google looks more like a mess than a success NOW WATCH: A mysterious cloud moving 700,000 mph is going to collide with our galaxy — here's what will happen Loading video...

Users have reported battery life issues with the latest Android build, with many pointing the finger at Google Play – Google's app store – and its persistent, almost obsessive need to check where you are. Amid complaints that Google Play is draining power supplies by repeatedly and unexpectedly using GPS, something more annoying is now clear: the app store is constantly tracking your whereabouts, and Google has made it impossible to switch this off unless you completely kill off location tracking for all applications. You can try to deny Google Play access to your handheld's location by opening the Settings app and digging through Apps -> Google Play Store -> Permissions, and flipping the switch for "location." But you'll be told you can't just shut out Google Play services: you have to switch off location services for all apps if you want to block the store from knowing your whereabouts. It's all or nothing, which isn't particularly nice. This is because Google Play services pass on your location to installed apps via an API. The store also sends your whereabouts to Google to process. Google doesn't want you to turn this off. It also encourages applications to become dependent on Google's closed-source Play services, rather than use the interfaces in the open-source Android, thus ensuring that people continue to run Google Play on their devices. It's a similar story over at Google Maps. Although it makes far more sense for Maps to have access to your location, the latest build doesn't give you a decent option of turning it off. If you do cut off Maps' access to your location, "basic features of your device may no longer function as intended," the operating system warns. Needless to say, this is not making some users very happy. Security researcher Mustafa Al-Bassam reported on Twitter that he "almost had a heart attack" when he walked into a McDonald's and was prompted on his phone to download the fast food restaurant's app. Al-Bassam dug into his phone's apps to figure out how that had happened, and was amazed to find that his suspected culprit – Google Maps – was not responsible. It was Google Play that had monitored his location thousands of times. Again, this is deliberate: Google is using your location to tout apps to you. If you wander into a pharmacy, you'll be offered software to print your photos, for example. If you're not keen on this, the options are not great: you can either delete Google Maps and/or Google Play, or you have to repeatedly turn your phone's location services on and off as required throughout the day, which is extremely irritating. "Kind of defeats the purpose of fine-grained privacy controls," Al-Bassam noted, adding: "Google is encouraging developers to use the Play location API instead of the native Android API, making an open OS dependent on proprietary software." Google was not available for comment. ® Update: Google says a bug was causing Play store services to access the GPS even when it shouldn't.

Read/post comments Google Photos Now Improves Live Photos -- The Google Photos app for iOS can now apply effects to Apple’s proprietary Harry Potter-like Live Photos and export them as videos or animated GIFs that others can play on any platform. You can also use Google Photos to smooth out shaky video in Live Photos or to create cinematic pans. Other tweaks in the Google Photos app include better album sorting options and the capability to choose a new thumbnail for faces in the People album. Live Photos can be taken only with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, the iPhone SE, 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and with the soon-to-be-released iPhone 7 models. Read/post comments Apple Tweaks iPad Configs and Pricing -- Even while focusing on the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2, Apple found time to tweak the iPad lineup’s configuration and pricing. The standard iPads — the iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, and iPad mini 2 — just became better deals. Prices remain the same, but for each price point, Apple doubled the base storage. You can now buy the iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 4 with either 32 GB ($399 for Wi-Fi or $529 for Wi-Fi plus cellular) or 128 GB ($499/$629), and the iPad mini 2 in just a 32 GB configuration ($269/$399). On the iPad Pro front, the storage options are unchanged for both the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models, but the 128 GB configurations dropped in price by $50, and the 256 GB configurations are now $100 cheaper. Our question is if this minor adjustment will be the only change to the iPad lineup that we’ll see for the rest of the year, or if Apple has new models up its sleeve. Read/post comments Why Apple Removed the iPhone Headphone Jack -- Many people were angered by Apple removing the standard 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, assuming that it was an intentional plan to increase wireless headphone sales for Apple subsidiary Beats. That fact may have played a role in the decision, but BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski offers a thorough and compelling narrative behind Apple’s decision: the company just ran out of space for it. “We’ve got this 50-year-old connector — just a hole filled with air — and it’s just sitting there taking up space, really valuable space,” said Dan Riccio, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering. “It was holding us back from a number of things we wanted to put into the iPhone. It was fighting for space with camera technologies and processors and battery life.” The camera systems in the iPhone 7 models are much larger than in previous models, and Apple engineers found that the easiest way to cram all the parts in was to remove the headphone jack. Removing it also helped with water resistance and allowed for larger batteries. Ultimately, it wasn’t Apple that killed the headphone jack, but simple math, and we’re willing to bet that most other smartphone manufacturers eventually follow suit.

Copyright corruption 13 September 2016 A week or so ago I read a rather funny story on the news wires. Apparently, Warner Brothers had issued complaint to Google about a site that contained its intellectual property. In most cases when this happens, Google is quick to pull the offending site from its index. In this case however, they refused to comply. Why? Because the site WB was complaining about was its own site! Yes, many copyright owners have outsourced the infringement-detection, complaint and prosecution roles and those companies undertaking such activities on behalf of the owner quite often simply rely on crappy programs running dodgy algorithms. In the case in question, the software obviously didn't have a "whitelist" of sites that were authorised to carry the "offending" content. Perhaps Google has its own whitelist which meant that WB didn't end up being highly embarrassed by the snafu but that whitelist will only be very small so it's not surprising that we have another story of a ludicrously false copyright strike hitting the news this morning. Now I'm sure that everyone reading this column knows what Ubuntu Linux is. You probably also know what an ISO file represents. With that in mind, you'll probably be as gobsmacked as me to learn that the bounty-hunters working for Paramount Studios issued a takedown notice for a torrent link that contained an Ubuntu ISO file and which, under no stretch of the imagination, could be mistaken for the "Transformers" movie they allege it was. Take a read of this report and review the evidence for your self. Google however, simply went ahead and acted on the DMCA takedown request without checking to see if it was valid. Is that fair? Of course not. Then again, as we know from bitter experience, Google's YouTube service regularly files its own false copyright strikes by way of the "Content ID" system used to check each and every upload for copyright infringements. This techdirt story is a perfect example of that. So Google goes out of their way to protect the nice people at WB from getting egg on their face but, at least on the face of it, don't give a shirt about an Ubuntu ISO being falsely submitted. Or is this whole story a bit of a beat-up? I haven't seen anywhere that someone has actually checked to see whether the allegedly innocent link actually is what it claims to be. After all, what better way to "hide" a pirated movie than to give it a bogus, innocent name so that (hopefully) the copyright bounty-hunters won't spot it? I also notice that the takedown notice calls this an "allegedly infringing URL" -- which indicates to me that they are placing the burden of verification on Google. If it's okay to "allege" that a URL is infringing and if there's no penalty for doing so, I would suggest that the DMCA system is so fatally flawed as to be useless. Any individual or company with a gripe against another could simply (and repeatedly) file DMCA takedown notices against their website and, since Google seems not to check and appears happy to act on mere "allegations", the results would be disastrous. However, I guess this is what happens when the very raison d'etre for copyright is abused and corrupted by the profit motive of large corporations. Please visit the sponsor!

Google has released more tools to help Microsoft .NET developers access and manipulate resources in Google's Cloud Platform environment. The company Sept. 12 announced a new set of Cloud Tools for PowerShell that is designed to let developers script, automate and manage Windows workloads on Google's cloud platform. According to Google, the new Cloud Tools allow developers to use the PowerShell command line to control Windows resources, automate common tasks, run scripts for analyzing data and generate reports without having to write custom applications for each task. The PowerShell update is available free of charge for customers of Google Cloud Platform and can be used to script and automate Windows resources in Google's Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL and Cloud DNS environments, said Mete Atamel, developer advocate at Google. Writing in Google's Cloud Platform blog, Atamel offered some examples of the kind of things developers will be able to do with the new PowerShell tools in each of the different environments. For example, against a Google Compute Engine instance, the new PowerShell tools allow developers to create a virtual machine (VM) instance on Compute Engine and to start, stop or restart a VM instance. Similarly, it lets developers add or remove firewall rules and create snapshots of the disk. With Cloud Storage, the new tools enable developers to create storage buckets on Google Cloud via the PowerShell command line. It lets them list all the storage buckets for a project and the contents of each bucket, as well as add or delete the content in a storage bucket. The tools enable similar benefits in Google Cloud SQL by, among other things, letting developers establish Cloud SQL instances, and creating failover replicas from the PowerShell interface. Meanwhile, with Cloud DNS, the PowerShell tools enable capabilities like creating managed zones for DNS domains, adding and removing resources, and creating resource record sets, Google said. Cloud Tools for PowerShell is part of a ramped-up effort by Google to help developers move and manage Windows workloads on the company's cloud infrastructure. In recent weeks and months, Google has made several other similar announcements. Only earlier this month, for instance, the company released new functionality for managing cloud platform resources from Visual Studio. The company described the tools as enabling a development environment for building and deploying .NET and Windows applications and deploying them to Google Cloud Platform. The company has also released new editions of SQL Server for Google Compute Engine that are designed specifically to handle production workloads in Google's cloud infrastructure. Google has previously noted that it wants to make ASP.Net applications "first-class citizens" on its Cloud Platform. The company has said that the support for Windows Server and SQL Server that is currently available on Compute Engine allows enterprises to move their application and SQL Server data more easily to the cloud. Google has also partnered with cloud migration and disaster recovery provider CloudEndure to help organizations migrate their Windows applications and data to the cloud without having to set up and configure new machines first.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   Google, Facebook Move To Curb Ads On 'Fake News' Sites Microsoft Outlook Customer Manager Helps SMBs Track Tasks, Contacts Facebook Unveils Messenger Group Chat in Canada, Australia How the Internet Came of Age as a Campaign Tool in 2016 Election Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Activate “Leverage Browser Caching” for the Google Analytics Script. Often, this alert is to be blamed when a website doesn’t reach the infamous 100 of 100 PageSpeed points. That’s exactly where the problem is, because how can you cache a file that is not on your server? Today, we’ll show you three solutions. Google Analytics is a good thing and still the tool of choice for every user that wants to take a close look at their website’s traffic. However, the script can also cause quite a headache when the goal is to optimize your website to achieve the famous 100 points from GooglePage Speed. One problem is that some of the aspects desired and recommended by Google will not accelerate your blog, so they are not recommendable. For example, when you implement your entire CSS (often multiple files, including the plugin stylesheets) in the HTML inline, Google will congratulate you for making this decision. However, when you only have a small perfectly cacheable stylesheet in the header, and the rest of the CSS in the footer, Google will try to tell you that this will slow your website down. Of course, the opposite is the case. The same applies for the Google Analytics error. The script will be cached by Google for two hours. However, Google wants to have a longer period. This doesn’t increase your website’s speed either. Google criticizes the short caching of the Analytics script, and thus, it only shows a maximum of 99 out of the 100 points. To solve this, there are multiple options. Three of which I’ll introduce you to today. Before We Start: Make Sure To Use Browser Caching If you’re still not using a code for a caching in your .htacess file, it’s about time. A simple browser caching combined with a compression of files already causes a significant speed boost. Here, you’ll find the necessary code, add it into the .htaccess in your blog’s main index. View the code on Gist. Solution 1: Host the Analytics Script Locally Host the script on your server. This solution is ambivalent. On one hand, it immediately removes the error, and you’ll easily get the 100 points. On the contrary, it is quite troublesome, as you have to make sure that the script is getting updated. To me, this solution seems to be good, as firstly, the script is delivered faster on my server, and secondly, with a little effort, it can also be updated automatically if you can start the proper cronjob on your hosting package. Step 1: Downloading Analytics.js Download the script used in the Google Analytics code. The URL is the following: https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js Load the script into the WordPress main index. The new path to the file could look like this: https://yourwebsite.com/analytics.js Now, search for your Google Analytics code in the theme or your plugins. If you happen to use a plugin that adds your Analytics code to the theme, deactivate the automatic addition to your theme. Otherwise, look in the header.php or the footer.php. You might also find it in your theme’s functions.php. Replace the Original URL With Your URL. View Script: View the code on Gist. Add the edited code into your theme’s footer – in the footer.php above or below of wp_footer();. Subsequently, upload the file into your theme folder. Step 2: Create a Script That Keeps Your Local Script Up to Date Create an empty file and name it analytics-update.php. Implement the following code into the file. View the code on Gist. Now, you need to extend this update file by the absolute path to your Google Analytics file. To do so, line 6 of the PHP file has to be added. To transmit the absolute path, create an empty file called dir.php and enter the following code: View the code on Gist. Copy this file into your WordPress’ main index and call up the file in the browser: http://yourwebsite/dir.php The lower path is correct, copy it, and replace the information in the analytics-update.php in line 6 with it. Afterward, delete the dir.php from your server, as it poses a security risk. Now make sure that both files on your server are writable. The file rights CHMOD 755 should be okay and work. Now, all you need to do is create a cronjob that calls up the analytics-update.php once a week. This works differently for each host and operating system so that I won’t post a code for this job. If your server doesn’t allow for Cronjobs, use an external service like cronjob.de. More Information: HowTo: Add Jobs To cron Under Linux or UNIX? The Final Result of Our Efforts By hosting it on our server, the file can be moved into the cache, and GooglePage Speed Insights now shows the desired 100/100 points. Solution 2: Use ga-lite.js Instead of Google-Analytics.js Ga-Lite is a slim version of the Google Analytics script. It was developed and optimized to have the best speed and optimal browser caching. It works perfectly and records the basic functions of the original code by Google Analytics. Another advantage: the ga-lite.js script loads much faster than the original. When you don’t just want to trick Google, but want to do something for the performance of your website, ga-lite is the right choice. However, it does have downsides at the moment. Custom quotations can not be used. The bounce rate can not be adjusted, and links can not be tracked. By now, the IPs can be marked up anonymously, however. The Installation of ga-lite: Implement the following code into the footer.php of your theme, above or below of wp_footer(). View the code on Gist. ga-lite will also get you to the desired result at GooglePage Speed. Solution 3: We Outsmart Google You’re using an adjusted Analytics code, and both solutions are out of the question? You want to keep everything the way it is, but you still want the 100 points for your ego? No problem, we also got an ego-solution to offer. For that, we use a small PHP function that simply makes the Google Analytics code “invisible” for PageSpeed Insights. This way, the Analytics.js works perfectly fine everywhere, except for the page of Google PageSpeed. Extend the Analytics Code With the Following: View the code on Gist. This code also gets you to the 100 points, but won’t speed up your website. This code is only there for your ego and lets you reach the 100 points without any significant modifications. Conclusion: The first solution seems to be the best to me but is not recommended by Google. It can only be used with a cronjob that always keeps the local file updated. Without this update step, the first solution is not recommendable at all. The second one is ideal when you have not made any changes to the Google Analytics code yet, and only use the analysis software’s default functions. You’ll still have access to them without any issues, and your website will be sped up at the same time. The third solution also works, but I don’t recommend it. Personally, I would prefer living with 99 points or less. The main thing is that my websites load in much less than a second.

Humans know that. But in a future world where cars drive themselves, how will the machine know what to do? Google has an idea and it's moving to patent technology that will detect an emergency vehicle's flashing lights and respond correctly. Google's patent application was published September 1. The feature would allow an autonomous vehicle to see and interpret flashing lights and their colors, specifically red, blue, and a potential third color, which is a common scheme of emergency lights. Google's plans call for computing systems and filters to allow an autonomous car to understand the difference between an ambulance and a traffic light. The systems would also allow the car to determine what kind of emergency vehicle is approaching. Google's patent documents say the feature could use cameras and sensors to execute the detection. It will also account for glare and colors not linked to emergency vehicles. Additionally, Google's idea considers the need to communicate with vehicle systems like the navigation, acceleration, steering, braking, and others.

Sanofi said last year it was working on a partnership with Google in diabetes. "The company will leverage Verily's experience in miniaturised electronics, analytics, and consumer software development, with Sanofi's clinical expertise and experience in bringing innovative treatments to people living with diabetes," the two companies said in a statement. The Sanofi deal comes after British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Verily - formerly Google Life Sciences (GOOGL.O) - created a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Verily is also working on development of a smart contact lens in partnership with Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.S) that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes. Diabetes is an illness that involves keeping track of blood sugar levels, diet, multiple medications and other health issues, noted Verily Chief Medical Officer Jessica Mega. "It's an area where we think new tools and sensors will be incredibly helpful," Mega said in a telephone interview. "The idea is creating best-in-class biocompatible small sensors" that could, for example, monitor blood glucose, she said. "We want to ... figure out the right mechanisms to get information to patients. Over time we hope to get information to people that is actionable," Mega said. Nearly 400 million people worldwide have diabetes, with type 2 accounting for more than 90 percent of cases. Without proper treatment, it can lead to a wide variety of serious health complications. The JV, called Onduo, "will initially focus on the type 2 diabetes community, specifically on developing solutions that could help people make better decisions about their day-to-day health, ranging from improved medication management to improved habits and goals," the companies said. A spokeswoman for Sanofi said products on sale would include connected objects such as insulin pens and online services. She said Sanofi had invested $248 million in the joint venture, in which the French group controls a 50 percent stake. Sanofi is working hard to revive declining sales in its diabetes division, hurt by sustained pricing pressure in the United States, the world's largest health market.

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-09-12 Print               The tablet would include 4GB of memory, but few other details are known at this time, according to a report by a well-known tipster. Google is planning a 7-inch tablet computer that will be built by Huawei and offered for sale by the end of 2016, according to a Twitter post by well-known IT tipster Evan Blass. "Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year," Blass wrote in the recent post, which lacked any additional details. Google's last 7-inch Android tablet was the Nexus 7. Blass' Twitter handle is @evleaks. The rumored machine could be announced by Google in October, when several other announcements are expected, including the first Google Daydream VR headset, a new Chromecast dongle and two new smartphones that have also been the subject of rumors. The two smartphone models, which are apparently being designed by Google itself rather than by third-party manufacturers, have been rumored since June, according to an earlier eWEEK story. By directly designing the devices, Google could have more control and oversight of its hugely popular Android mobile operating system, which could help it take on Apple more directly in the smartphone wars, the story reported. Google has offered Android handsets in the past through arrangements with manufacturers such as HTC, Huawei and others, but those handsets were designed by those companies and carried Google Nexus nameplates, without Google's own designs. Google has not previously designed and built its own phones. Earlier in September, Google suspended one of its other recent smartphone initiatives, its Project Ara smartphone effort, which began in 2013 with the concept of designing a phone platform that would incorporate a wide array of camera, audio and other modules as desired by users. Project Ara was ended as part of an effort to streamline the company's hardware efforts, even after its progress was touted at Google's I/O developer conference earlier this year. The company had said at that time that is expected to ship a developer edition of Project Ara this fall. The Ara phones centered on a baseplate or frame that incorporated a display, CPU, graphics processing unit, sensors and all the functionality of a standard smartphone. Google was scheduled to release a preview version of Ara this fall in a bid to spur developer interest in the technology and ensure that modules for a wide range of applications would be available for the smartphone at launch. Organizations that were working with Google in developing modules for Ara included Samsung and Sony. Among the modules that Google was working on was one that would integrate the functions of a glucometer so people with diabetes could measure their glucose levels using their smartphones. In March, a Google Nexus handset, the Nexus 5X, debuted as the second phone being sold for use with Google's Project Fi mobile phone services, which start at $20 a month. The Nexus 5X smartphone is made by LG for use with Google's Project Fi inexpensive monthly wireless service plans. The Nexus 5X is priced at $349 for a 16GB model or $399 for a 32GB model. Project Fi is Google's inexpensive mobile phone service that came out in April 2014 under what was then an invitation-only system. Project Fi phone services recently opened to all users who buy or provide a compatible Nexus smartphone that will work with the service. So far, the Nexus 6P by Huawei, the new Nexus 5X and the earlier Nexus 6 are the only three smartphones that will work with Project Fi's network. Users pay $20 per month for cellular access, plus data fees of $10 per GB only for the data that is consumed each month. The monthly access fee also includes unlimited talk and texting, WiFi tethering and international coverage in more than 120 countries.             LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google renames Nexus Launcher to Pixel Launcher – Imminent rebranding confirmed It has been rumoured that the new smartphones from Google this year will no longer be called Nexus but will take the Pixel sub-branding instead. We now have evidence to support this theory in the form of a launcher. Google’s Nexus launcher has just been renamed to Pixel launcher. Visually, it looks identical to the previous Nexus launcher apart from a new version number and icon. So this renaming more or less confirms the fact that Google will be renaming its Nexus range of smartphones to Pixel which is surprising considering that the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P did really well and the Pixel C didn’t do that well. The Pixel Launcher has a software version 7.1.xxxx which is also a possible indication that the new phones will come with Android Nougat 7.1 out of the box. While the V20 from LG did claim the title to being the first smartphone to come with Android Nougat out of the box, the Pixel phones will come with 7.1 while the V20 will be released with 7.0. Nonetheless, we assume Google has a grand plan in mind and we should be seeing the Pixel X and Pixel X smartphones being announced in October and will be running Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box. You can download and check out Pixel Launcher here. Pixel Launcher does overwrite and install itself over Nexus Launcher so it is indeed the same software that has been renamed.

Now iOS users get to join the fun. Google is bringing its Cardboard Camera 360-degree photo app to iOS, where users can snap and share virtual reality scenes. First released last fall for Android, Cardboard Camera is a complement to Google's Cardboard VR headset, which enables pretty much any smartphone to offer a taste of what VR can offer. And what better way to encourage casual VR experimenting, Google says, than making it easy for people to create content themselves? Cardboard Camera for iOS outputs 3D panoramic photos using the familiar technique found in Apple's native Camera app. You hold your phone vertically, tap record, then turn around as though you're taking a panorama. As an added twist, the Cardboard Camera app also captures a bit of the ambient sound from wherever it is you're taking your photo. //Related Articles Take VR Pictures With Google's Cardboard Camera App The first version of the app was lacking in sharing options: friends would have to borrow your phone and shove it into their Google Cardboard setup in order to view your creations. The iOS app eliminates that cumbersome process. You can now select multiple Cardboard-produced photos to create a virtual album, tap the new share icon, and the app will generate a link that can be emailed, messaged, or posted on the Web. The sharing feature is also available for Android, though your friends will of course still need a Google Cardboard headset or other VR viewer of their own to view your work. Google says more than 5 million photos have been captured with Cardboard Camera on Android. That number will certainly jump now that it has added iOS to the party. Even though there are far fewer iOS devices than those running Android, Apple's phones have more powerful cameras than many Android models, so they should provide a more satisfying do-it-yourself VR experience.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Remember the unofficial release of that Nexus Launcher, said to come stock on Google’s upcoming Marlin and Sailfish devices? Well, a new update, courtesy of LlabTooFeR, reveals the launcher’s name has been changed. I’ll give you one guess why. Following rumors that Google would release two “Pixel” devices this fall, the Nexus Launcher’s name has been changed to reflect Google’s new preference. Now, the unreleased launcher is simply known as the Pixel Launcher, adding more evidence to the report that the Nexus name is being retired. As for the update to the Pixel Launcher, there don’t appear to be any major new features. However, the latest version is up to 7.1-xxxx, so it would seem Google’s upcoming handset could indeed launch with Android 7.1 Nougat. We did a brief hands-on with the Nexus Launcher last month, which ditches the app drawer icon in favor of a drawer that slides up from the bottom. Additionally, there’s a Google tab that quickly pulls up search rather than a persistent bar always sitting on your home screen. Google is reportedly going to introduce its new Pixel devices early next month, so it shouldn’t be long until we know more.

Google's new camera app, originally launched for Android last December, works specifically with Google Cardboard-certified viewers. The idea is that - with Cardboard Camera - your iPhone can turn into a VR camera. Cardboard Camera captures something called "VR photos", which are basically three-dimensional panoramas with slightly different views for each eye.  You can even record sound, adding another layer of dimension to the whole immersive experience. Afterward, slot your iPhone into a Cardboard-certified viewer to see your new VR photo. The headset basically lets you explore this new type of image in all directions. Also, starting Monday, you can also share your VR photos with friends and family on both iPhone and Android devices. All you have to do is select multiple photos to create a virtual photo album, then tap the share icon, and Cardboard Camera will generate a link that can be emailed, messaged, or posted in apps and on the web, according to Google. Of course, your friends will need a Cardboard-certified VR viewer like Google Cardboard to actually see your VR photos. Check out Pocket-lint's Cardboard Camera guide for more information about how the app works. Cardboard Camera is free to download and use. Also, here's a list of all the Cardboard-certified viewers available. Pocket-lint has this round-up of all the best Cardboard rivals available, as well.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Google to Ramp Up Warnings for Sites That Use HTTP Dell, HPE CEOs Debate the Merits of Their Strategies Trick 3D Uses VR to Let Potential Buyers Virtually Tour Properties Government Surveillance Poses Cyber-security Threats, ISPs Say       Today's topics include Google's intention to start shaming websites that fail to use the more secure HTTPS internet protocol, How Dell and HPE are taking diametrically opposed approaches to rebuilding their businesses to stay competitive in the IT infrastructure market, Trick 3D's launch of its Floorplan Revolution real estate VR service, and why internet and managed service providers in the UK fear that government surveillance will only weaken network security. As a self-appointed watchdog of network security, Google will soon start publicly shaming websites that fail to use the HTTPS protocol for transmitting passwords and other sensitive data. Google will mark their websites as "non-secure" so users know clearly that their personal data is not being protected adequately. Website owners have until Jan. 1, 2017, to implement HTTPS for transmitting sensitive data. Google's new site labeling policy will go into effect after that date. The move is part of an ongoing effort by the company to get website owners to start using HTTPS, long considered a much safer alternative to HTTP. Eventually, Google will start marking all HTTP sites as non-secure and not just when they fail to use HTTPS to handle sensitive data. The diametrically opposed strategies that Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are taking to navigate their way through a rapidly changing tech industry were on full display the same day last week, giving executives for both the chance to make their cases. Dell CEO Michael Dell and his HPE counterpart, Meg Whitman, not only argued why they made the moves they did, but also why they believe their respective strategies put their company in a better position to manage the industry's shift to the cloud and the broad range of emerging technologies, including the fast-growing internet of things, the proliferation of mobile devices, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and software-defined everything. At the CTIA Super Mobility 2016 conference in Las Vegas, vendor Trick 3D was showing off its Floorplan Revolution cloud-based real estate visualization services, which were launched in March after some eight years of development and refinement. Part of the delay in bringing the product out was due to the real estate slowdown, particularly involving high-end properties, since the 2008 recession, Chad Eikhoff, the founder and creative director of the virtual studio company, told eWEEK. Floorplan Revolution allows prospective buyers to virtually tour a property using a VR visualization based on the 2D floor plans envisioned by developers. The VR images can be viewed using any device, including a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop or a desktop computer, or can be viewed in more detail using a VR headset and a custom app for the HTC Hive, Samsung Gear VR or Google Cardboard viewers. While most internet and managed service providers see cyber-attacks on a weekly basis, the most common concern among these companies is that government surveillance will weaken network security and make providers a more inviting target for cyber-attackers, according to a report released by the UK Internet Services Providers Association. The report, released Sept. 6, found that 54 percent of respondents were attacked every week. Currently, denial-of-service attacks and SQL injection attacks are the main types of cyber-threats internet and managed service providers face, with 91 percent of respondents suffering a denial-of-service attack, 64 percent an SQL injection attack and 36 percent a phishing attack.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

This includes bioelectronics, ‘smart’ contact lenses, robotic surgery and software platforms. With the new venture the idea is that Verily brings expertise in software and technology and Sanofi bring their experience of medicine and drug treatments. The two companies will form a new company called Onduo ($500 million venture). The mission statement will be to enable those with diabetes to lead a better quality of life, harnessing hardware and software to enable this to happen. The immediate focus will be with type 2 diabetes (the ‘lifestyle condition’); eventually resources will be directed towards type 1 diabetes (the condition that some people are born with). The newly appointed chief executive of Onduo is Dr. Joshua Riff. Speaking with the website Pharma Phorum, Riff said why the company’s mission statement was important: “My experience as a physician and in leading consumer health initiatives has shown me the daily burden of living with diabetes.” He also explained the challenges faced by those with diabetes: “From monitoring food intake to testing glucose levels to actively seeking medical care, the challenges both on the physical and mental well-being of a person living with diabetes are incredibly difficult.” He then went on to explain the technological drivers: “We want to develop solutions that allow people living with diabetes to focus on the things they love and enjoy in life by providing tools to make dealing with their diabetes less burdensome.” The ideas being considered include collecting data about patients and using this as a collective support forum; producing connected insulin pens; and in developing monitoring devices. The forum will take the form of a complex support platform. The new company has promised to work with patient advocacy groups in putting the final package together.

It's all "inside baseball" and our traffic patterns suggest that our audience isn't terribly interested in inside baseball unless it's a really big deal. Well, within the API economy, you'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger deal than Google acquiring API management solution provider Apigee. On the one hand, no one I know saw this coming. On the other, we might have anticipated it. Hindsight is, of course 20/20.  So, how did we get to this point in the API economy's history? First and foremost, some interesting numbers: Apigee went public in April 2015 at $17 per share and it's been a bit of a rocky ride ever since. On the day of its IPO, it briefly rose to $20 per share before closing on the downside at $16.68. Google has agreed to acquire Apigee for $625M which works out to be about $17.40 per share. During Apigee's outing as a public company, some pundits were mistakenly bullish. In 2014, on the eve of Apigee's IPO, SeekingAlpha's Don Dion called it the "Tech Buy of the Week." In September 2015, Zacks Equity Research called Apigee "a great momentum stock." I have no insight into whether Apigee's investors got what they hoped for (sometimes they take the money and run at the IPO, other times not). But I know enough to know that most public companies do not view an acquisition at 40 cents north of their IPO price to be a stellar outcome. For Google though, it was a good deal. Maybe not as good as it would have been had it tried to make the buy in February when the company was trading at its 52-week low of $5.35. In its coverage of the deal, Recode said that "sources in the industry applauded the deal as smart (and thrifty) for Google." While I'm sure no one at Google sneezed at the deal, perhaps it helps to put it into financial perspective: Google's total value (its market cap) typically fluctates on a daily basis by more than 10x the price it paid for Apigee. Google's acquisition of Apigee is the third such acquisition of an API management pure play in the last year (give or take a few days). By "API management pure play," I mean a solution provider that focuses exclusively on the management of the API lifecycle. In August 2015, Tibco, a company more traditionally know for solutions that dealt with enterprise integration and the business logic-driven hosting and choreography of event-driven workflows, acquired Mashery from Intel. Intel had previously acquired Mashery in April 2013 for about $180 million.  Then, in June of this year, Red Hat, another company with strengths in integration and business logic, announced it would be acquiring API management pure-play 3Scale. And now, Google is acquiring Apigee.  To the untrained eye, the pattern isn't so clear. But to just about anybody that keeps an eye on the integration and API management sectors, it should be obvious. Back in the old days of XML-RPC styled Web services (which are not very old) and beyond, the art of meshing large often dissimilar software systems involved a fair amount of business logic that lived at the heart of what would become known as an integration platform. Deep inside, often driven by Java source code that mirrored an enterprise's business processes, these platforms could support the sort of workflows whereby data flowing from one foreign system to another could be transformed and massaged for suitability to the recipient. And just some data's sudden arrival into one of these workflows was treated as an event that might trigger some other business process that was hosted by the same platform. Typically, wiring these platforms up to the various enterprise systems like those from Oracle or SAP required bespoke software connectors; essentially compatability shims that lived between the integration platform and the softwares that were being pulled into the integration mix. If you were to diagram it, the brains (to handle the business logic) were in the middle with the connectors on the edge, living in the seams between the business logic and the foreign systems. Then, Web APIs came along and, to make a long story short, due to their reliance on existing HTTP standards (HTTP is the standard protocol that makes the Web tick), they started to take a lot of the bespokeness out of the bespoke connectors. Though very different architecturally from their predecessors, fundamentally, APIs didn't change the arrangement of the diagram. Where APIs were replacing connectors (and continue to do so), they were still pretty much at the edge, dealing with the seam. As the world began its shift to Web APIs at the edge, there developed a need for products and services to manage their sprawl and lifecycle which in turn gave rise to API management startups.  One API management pure play -- Mashery -- was probably the first to act on the opportunity. Back in 2006, when I founded Mashup Camp -- the industry's first event to focus exclusively on Web APIs -- one of the event's first sponsors to get in line to talk about what he was up to was Oren Michels; then the founder of Mashery. Clearly a visionary, Michels was talking about the need to manage Web APIs before most people knew what a Web API even was. So new was his startup that he was emailing me from his inbox at mit.edu instead of mashery.com. As a side note (and for those of you who like to connect the dots), the first Mashup Camp in February 2006 at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View is where I met and became great friends with John Musser who had just founded ProgrammableWeb. As the API economy blossomed and the need for API management became more apparent, other pure-plays raced to help tame the edge. One of those was Apigee whose flagship offering is not surprisingly named Apigee Edge. The race included others like Layer 7 and 3Scale. But, as strong as these pure-plays were at what they did, they lacked a part of the diagram that was still important to enterprises; a platform of any sort to deal with business logic (be that for integration or even for a regular business application). As it turned out for their investors, this omission would serve them pretty well because as pure plays, they could be paired with platform providers who one-day woke up to the reality that they had better get hitched to an API management solution. While Web APIs were becoming all the rage at the edge and guys like Oren Michels were right about the need to manage them, enterprises' need to accomodate the business logic part of the diagram was showing no signs of slowing down. Back in the integration world, a small handful of vendors -- Akana (formerly SOA Software), MuleSoft, and WSO2 -- who had found success in providing the logic platforms and connectors looked at the API onslaught and saw the opportunity for a natural marriage to offer what many customers wanted; a single throat to choke for both integration and API management. The result? In the 2012-2013 timeframe, they scrambled their engineering teams to add API management into their product and service portfolios; endeavors that all continue to this day (disclosure: MuleSoft acquired ProgrammableWeb in 2013). Despite routine derision of this marriage by the pure plays as a part of their competitive messaging, the trend that led us up to this week's acquisition of Apigee by Google clearly validates the early thinking that customers are better served by solutions that that can simultaneously deal with both business logic and API management.  While Akana, MuleSoft, and WSO2 chose to engineer their way to such diversification, the first integration vendor to buy its way into a marriage with API management was probably Axway when it acquired Vordel in late 2012.  That was followed by the first acquisition of Mashery by Intel and CA's acquisition of Layer 7 in April 2013. In October of that year, Microsoft saw the potential in the marriage of platform and APIs and acquired Apiphany. In a bit of reporting for ProgrammableWeb that was eerily clairvoyant when it came to Amazon and Google, Michael Vizard wrote: Microsoft immediately turned off the API management service; at least in terms of signing up new customers. Given that the acquisition of Apihany was led by the Microsoft Azure group the expectation is that the Apiphany technology will one day reemerge as a service on Azure. In fact, Microsoft’s end game appears to be an effort to develop an API ecosystem around Azure that will attract enough applications to give the cloud platform the critical mass it needs to compete with rival public cloud services from Amazon and Google. As cloud computing and the API economy increasing converge, major cloud platform providers are trying to ensure their long term viability by creating zones they can dominate within the larger API economy. Google and Amazon have both famously tied the knot between their platforms and API management (although Amazon is still very early in its journey). But not before Intel realized it didn't own a real spouse for Mashery and set about finding one in Tibco, who, as more of a traditional integration company, lacked the prescience in the 2012/2013 timeframe to diversify by building or buying. Likewise, Red Hat may have waited too long to recognize the importance of API management to the customers of its various platforms (especially the Java-driven JBOSS). It dipped its toe in the water with an open source API management solution called APIMAN but ultimately resorted to buying its way into the business with its acquisition of 3Scale. APIMAN is being sunsetted and any of Red Hat's customers looking for ongoing support when it comes to API management will have to transition to the 3Scale technology. Such surprises can be painful and speak to the need to interrogate your solution providers to make sure they (a) have a very clear vision when it comes to the future and (b) are committed to that vision.  Meanwhile, Red Hat wasted no time in drawing attention to the kind of success that's produced when a single vendor can cover a customer for both platform and API management when it announced that Norwegian airport express train operator Flytoget signed up as a customer of both Red Hat's JBoss Fuse and 3Scale's API management technology "as part of an initiative to digitise and automate the company's key value chain." Then, over the course of the last couple of years and in their efforts to marry their development platforms to API management, Amazon, IBM (Bluemix), and Microsoft (Azure) have signficantly ramped their API management capabilities (partially fulfilling Vizard's prohecy regarding Microsoft's acquisition of Apiphany). Earlier this week, when I was at the Government API meetup in Washington, DC (a great meetup if you can ever make it), a group of us were talking about the pattern of API pure plays getting married-off to platform vendors as we tried to answer the question of who would propose to Apigee (it has been no secret that Apigee was looking for a buyer). We ran down the list of possibilities. SAP? Oracle? Both could benefit from a marriage to API management. Perhaps Microsoft or IBM? While they have pre-existing technologies, both are keen to gain more customers and have proven willing to do it through acquisition. The exercise was mainly one of looking for a platform provider of any type that was missing the API management puzzle piece. Never did we guess Google.  But in hindsight, we should have. Google practically gave birth to the API economy when it launched the first Web API (Google Maps) in 2005. Very few companies understand APIs, and invests in them, the way Google does. Not just in providing them the way many other API providers do. But also in advancing the technology behind them. For example, gRPC and Protocol Buffers; both of which could shape the future of APIs. It was just last week that ProgrammableWeb wrote about Google getting serious about API management with the launch of its beta of Google Cloud Endpoints; a solution that can churn out an API for anything you've built on any of the Google Cloud Platform offerings (App Engine, Container Engine and Compute Engine). Applications? Microservices? It doesn't matter. They all need logic. So, very clearly, Google is positioning its solutions to be very prolific providers of APIs. But, whereas Google Cloud Endpoints primarily handles the development and provisioning part, what about the rest of the API lifecycle? Those APIs would have to be managed. So here again, much the same way that Akana, Axway, CA, MuleSoft, and WSO2 set themselves on a strategic course to marry platform with API management nearly four years ago (and others since), Google has recognized the strategic importance of a similar union.  Moving forward however, the acquisition raises several interesting questions and possibilities. For example, Apigee has previously partnered with Amazon to show how to use Apigee for AWS-powered applications. Given that Google Cloud Platform and Amazon AWS are now such fierce competitors in the cloud, will Google be so willing to partner with Amazon (or vice versa) on such endeavors in the future and where does that leave customers of the AWS-specific reference architecture offered by Apigee? [updated after original publication:] Another question, posed in one of the comments below is what this means long-term for Apigee's on-premise solutions given how Google's cloud positioning pretty much eschews anything on-prem. In response, another commenter pointed out how Google senior vice president Diane Greene mentioned in her announcement that Google remains committed to supporting an on-prem solution. Additionally, one of Apigee's strengths was its independence. Most companies could do business with Apigee and remain relatively assured that Apigee would not go into competition with them. Given the many business sectors that Google currently competes in (or may venture into), there's now a stronger possibility that some of Apigee's existing customers and prospects could view Apigee as a foe rather than a friend. What then? What do you think about the acquisition and the long term trend? Is this the end or are there more acquisitions on the way? Feel free to comment below and I'll be sure to respond.

I am been following Apigee since the Sonoa days and believe the acquisition makes a lot of sense, especially to help Google drive into the enterprise space. 2 questions: 1) Would it put a question mark behin Apigee's on-premise offering? Google is know to not believe anything not in the cloud. 2) Would Oracle acquiring Amberpoint back in 2010 qualify as an early version of the trend you cite? david_berlind 8:26 AM Sep. 10 2016 reply Hi @spacelord and thanks so much for replying. In answer to your questions,  1. I think that's just another question worth asking at this point. I am trying to think of an on-premise solution offered by Google and I cannot think of one. That doesn't mean that one doesn't exist. It's just that one doesn't come to mind at the moment.  2. The question you're really asking is whether the acquisition of an older SOA governance solution like Amberpoint qualifies and I just think that depends on your point if view. There's a POV that Services Oriented Infrastructure (SOA) is synonomous with RPC-styled Web services and that Web APIs are something so entirely different that they can barely be discussed in the same breath. It's no surprise that SOA Software changed its name (to Akana). It didn't want the SOA stereotype to sully it's positioning in the API space. If this is your POV, then I'd say the answer is "no" because you've already drawn a line in the sand and one doesn't necessarily carry over into the other. But, my personal POV (and I'm sure I'll get some grief for this) is that Web APIs and the older XML-based APIs are both APIs and that the general architectural concept works off the idea that a software component can be turned into a networkable service to which other software can outsource their tasks. To me, they both fall under the rubric of service-orientation and a lot of people get hung up on semantics. "SOA" turned into a label that it should never have turned into because as a concept, I think Web APIs do a better job of capturing the spirit of service orientation then the older XML-RPC styled APIs do. One need only look at the microservices discussion to agree. Ultimately, microservices are services. Most of them are abstracted by RESTful Web APIs. Are we to suggest that is NOT a services oriented architecture? This is one reason ProgrammableWeb's data model is agnostic to these sorts of semantics.  So, back to Oracle, if acquiring Amberpoint also helped the company to set itself on a strategic path to manage APIs of any feather, to govern service regardless of type, then I'd say yes, it fits into the trend. For example, though we don't hear much about it, Oracle actually has an API management solution. I haven't looked closely, but I'll bet that while it can stand independently, it's also pretty well tuned to Oracle's other solutions. Check out the path in the URL for its home page: http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/soa/api-management/overview... LOL! It's under "SOA." So, what I don't know is how or if Oracle's acquisition of Amberpoint is connected to Oracle's launch of it's API management product (Oct 2015). If they're connected, then absolutely, I think one could say that Amberpoint deserves to be on the timeline because it put Oracle on the path to where it is today.  michels 5:52 PM Sep. 10 2016 reply On the "on premise" solution - there's the Google Search Appliance, but my understanding is that it is being sunsetted. michels 5:48 PM Sep. 10 2016 reply Thanks for the very, very kind words, David. And, as always, your insight into how the pieces are arranging themselves.  When we started Mashery I had a bit of an idea of what we needed to do, but a big part of my "vision" was formed by the amazing people I talked to during our early years. Some of them invested, some joined the Mashery team, and others became customers. But two who were in neither camp stand out. The first is John Musser, who you mention. Rafer and I had previously founded a directory business, so we understood the value of a comprehensive directory to a developing ecosystem, and expected to build one as part of Mashery. But then I found out about programmableweb and this John Musser guy and reached out to him. My first trip on Mashery's dime was to Seattle to see John, who generously offered to meet with me and answer all of my questions even though our respective visions had no shortage of overlap.I quickly realized that Mashery and the entire market would be well served by leaving the directory business to John, and over the years we built a wonderful friendship (and I learned something every time I talked to him). The second, of course, is some guy who had enough vision to start doing events around APIs and founded Mashup Camp, which spawned thousands upon thousands of hackathons in every corner of the globe. For someone new to the API world, it was amazing to be able to attend an event where likeminded people coming at the API concept from all different directions could compare notes and learn from each other. Cheers to you! david_berlind 9:24 AM Sep. 12 2016 reply Hey Oren (@michels), Thanks for writing in here. On the Google Search Appliance, I considered that.... but then I recalled reading that it was being withdrawn from market (as you suggested). Then again, as pointed out by another commenter (@Nick), Diane Greene said that Google is committed to supporting on prem "as always."   Thanks for your kind words too. I agree on John and am thankful to have had the torch passed to me as we take ProgrammableWeb to the next level. So much has changed since those days. We have much work to do and a lot of it is at the foundational level. For example, we've been very busy building out our understanding and record of SDKs that go with all the APIs and we're tuned in like we've never been before to all the API versioning that's happening. So long as there are multiple versions of an API available to developers (not just older versions, but newer pre-release ones too), it changes the idea of having a single record for the closest-production API. So, we're modernizing our data model to reflect the maturity of the API lifecycle.  I'm not sure that we spawned thousands upon thousands of hackathons ... but those sure were the early days of hackathons and I can't be thankful enough for the number of enduring friendships with brilliant people that came as a result of that work. And, had we never done that, I would not be here today at ProgrammableWeb.  It's crazy how one decision (thanks to an after-hours conversation with Google and Flickr) can change your entire life. monohusche 11:18 PM Sep. 11 2016 reply Regarding question 1, not so sure that the picture is that black-and-white. First of all, Google seems to understand that for many enterprises (and that's where Google has to catch up), hybrid cloud is there to stay (at least for now). Hence their increasing involvement with OpenStack which is the main open source private cloud play. Besides, their strategy to world domination is not to exclude other architecture options than public cloud, but just making it easier with their own solutions. So for instance for container orchestration, they have successfully managed to make Kubernetes the main contender, partially by embracing other platforms than just Google Cloud. Of course hoping that a large percentage of potential customer still uses GCP as their public cloud choice, Given the clear synergies of API Mgmt and container orchestration/service discovery, they have announced that they will integrate Kubernetes and Apigee while making it work both in the public cloud and on-prem. see below. From the google blog: "Looking ahead, Kubernetes will be integrated to help enterprises get better control and visibility into how their internal systems talk to one another, an additional part of deploying services. As always, we'll make sure that these capabilities are available in the public clouds and can also be used on-premises." Nick david_berlind 9:03 AM Sep. 12 2016 reply @Nick, thanks so much for writing in with these great points and thanks for pointing out Greene's statement regarding on prem solutions (I've updated the post accordingly!). Although I'd point out that Greene wrote "As always, we'll make sure that these capabilities are available in the public clouds and can also be used on-premises."  On the one hand, "as always?" or is it really more recently in recognition of your point regarding the enterprise need for hybrid cloud support?  That said, she did say "public clouds" which leads you to believe that, at least in this case, she intends to remain cloud agnostic (as should be the case when Kubernetes is involved, right?).  On the "black and white" issue, I don't think I meant to imply that it's strictly a black and white question to the exclusion of all other questions. There are of course many more permutations and possibilities when you consider the great many situations where API management naturally fits like a puzzle piece to a much larger picture that's ultimately more complicated than the one I painted. But, the question still remains given the long-term trend of API management companies getting married off to one platform provider or another.  Today in APIsLatest news about the API economy and newest APIs, delivered daily: Subscribe Leave this field blank API University FOR API PROVIDERS What Are APIs and How Do They Work?8 Real World API Strategies and the Keys to Their SuccessHow To Find a Rockstar API Product Manager More for API Providers  › FOR DEVELOPERS How To Implement Deep Linking in iOSHow To Get Started With Twitter's FabricHow To Develop An Android Wear App More for Developers  › Advertisement   Additional Resources API Growth Charts, Industry Research & More Developer How-to's & Live Presentations Meet The Editors David Berlind Editor in Chief @dberlind Articles Wendell Santos Editor wendell78 Articles Advertisement     Directories & Listings API Directory Mashups and Applications SDKs & Libraries How To's, Source Code Resources About ProgrammableWeb Advertise FAQ Contributed Content Guidelines Get Paid to Write for ProgrammableWeb Contact Us Business & Legal Site Terms of Service Privacy Policy Subscribe Rss Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn

At the time, the Nexus Launcher name made sense, but in the weeks since we’ve heard a lot of new information about Google’s upcoming devices and odds are, the company won’t keep the Nexus branding… At this point, it’s all but confirmed that Google’s 2016 smartphones will adopt the Pixel brand, to be named the Pixel and Pixel XL. Now LlabTooFeR has given us even further confirmation of the new branding, showing us the newly-renamed “Pixel Launcher,” previously known as the Nexus Launcher. As far we can see in these screenshots, the Pixel Launcher brings no major changes feature-wise compared to the Nexus Launcher — just a new name and a new version number. That new version number also helps to confirm what version of Android the Pixel devices will ship with. It was previously reported that these devices would ship with Android 7.1, and these new screenshots corroborate that showing 7.1-32xx. Google is expected to host an event on October 4th to unveil the new Pixel smartphones, so we should learn more very soon. No APKs are available yet for the Pixel Launcher, but if this is anything like the Nexus Launcher, one will probably drop sooner or later. (via LlabTooFeR on Twitter) Update: Just like clockwork, the Pixel Launcher APKs are here straight from LlabTooFeR himself. Head over to his site (which is currently getting hammered with downloads, alternate links below) to grab the APK for yourself. If you already have the Nexus Launcher installed, this will install as an update to the app. Keep in mind that we are not the origin of this APK and cannot guarantee that the files are safe, so install at your own risk.

Google Advertisement Chris Urmson, the mild-mannered robotics expert who ran Google’s self-driving car project, used to say that when his son reached driving age in 2019 the technology would be available so the teenager wouldn’t have to take a driving test. In August, less than a year after auto industry veteran John Krafcik took the helm of the project, Urmson left with much work remaining: Google has yet to launch an autonomous vehicle service for the public. Other top technologists have also departed and progress has been slow. Once considered a leader in the field, Google has lost its first-mover advantage to other companies pursuing more practical, less-ambitious self-driving car services, said former members of the project and other people familiar with the situation. They asked not to be identified because details of the effort are private. “They need a partner, a sales force, a strategy,” said Roger Lanctot, associate director of Strategy Analytics’ Global Automotive Practice. Popular Now More 'Must Have' Metrics to Drive Continuous Improvement Trump is Right on Trade, But He Doesn’t Know Why Accelerating Manufacturing Business Growth | New Technologies for New Times Google’s project started in 2009, long before carmakers and most other companies seriously considered the technology. But when Singapore unveiled the first autonomous taxi service in August, Google wasn’t involved. Instead, a small startup called nuTonomy provided the technology. Uber Technologies Inc., founded in 2009, will soon let users of its popular ride-sharing app hail autonomous Volvo SUVs in Pittsburgh. Google has driven more than 1.8 million miles in tests on public roads in a bid to perfect its software to handle difficult situations, such as driving in snow. Tesla Motors Inc. already offers partially autonomous features in more than 70,000 of its electric cars, and Otto, a startup run by former Google car project members, is developing a self-driving system for trucks on highways, an easier technological challenge than the one Google faces. Uber acquired Otto in July. “Google still has an imperfect system and no clear path to go to market,” said Ajay Juneja, chief executive officer of Speak With Me Inc., which offers voice recognition and related technology for cars, watches and other connected devices. “How exactly would they have shipped something by now?” Broader Challenge » 1 2 3 Next Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Related Stories The Commune in Ethiopia Where Feminism is the Law The Bonkers Real-Life Plan to Drain the Mediterranean and Merge Africa and Europe The Illustrated Map of America's Worst Utopias An award-winning playground. (Photo: Jack Goodman) New York City has many glorious and terrible attributes. One thing it generally isn’t, though, is utopian. One fifth of the population live below the poverty line, yet it has the highest cost of living in the U.S., with few of the egalitarian living arrangements typical of utopian communities. Yet there is one place in the sprawling metropolis, however, that is literally a Utopia.  Utopia, Queens, is a tiny neighborhood surrounded by Jamaica Estates, Fresh Meadows, and Flushing.  It purportedly got its name from the Utopia Land Company, which in 1903, tried to re-house Jewish families living in Manhattan’s squalid Lower East Side. The plan never came to fruition, but the name lived on in the form of the Utopia Parkway, which influenced the naming of the nearby Utopia playground, and of course the neighborhood itself. You’re wrong, Google. This is not Utopia. (Photo: (c) 2016 Google) Exploring Utopia, getting a sense of how “utopian” it is, and speaking to people who live there, it turns out, is not straightforward. Figuring out if the neighborhood bears any relation to paradise depends who you ask and where you look. Some people there will even claim it doesn’t exist. Google Maps, however, is certain that it does, so I set off to find it. According to Google, the quickest way to get to Utopia from Manhattan’s Upper West Side is via the F train to 169th Street, and then the Q30 or 31 bus. The route seemed simple enough, even if I never thought I’d enter any kind of utopia on a city bus. But as the bus meandered along the final leg of the journey through Flushing, it was exciting to watch the blue map dot move closer to the area designated “UTOPIA”. I rang the bell to exit the bus at Utopia Playground, a nearly three-acre green space replete with a climbing wall, tennis and basketball courts, and a rainbow fence. The park “lives up to its name,” said Parks and Recreation Commissioner Adrian Benepe, who bestowed it with the honor of “Park of the Month” in December 2009. Impressive. The tree that wrongly marks Utopia. (Photo: Jack Goodman) The geographic heart of Utopia, according to Google Maps, was off Utopia Parkway on 67th Avenue and 180th Street. An attractive tree marked the spot: here was Utopia. The area has a distinctly suburban feel. The lawns in front of the two-story detached houses are neatly trimmed, and the flower beds well-tended.  This part of Queens is well-off. Donald J. Trump grew up round the corner in Jamaica Estates. The mean household income is $80,000, house prices in the area keep going up, and more people have college degrees than the city average. The quiet, tree-lined streets give off the impression, in accordance with the statistics, that this is a nice place to live. A few houses down 180th Street from the exact location of Utopia, a man sat at a desk under his garage roof, filing what looked like newspaper clippings. When asked, he was adamant that this area was not Utopia. He’d never heard of a neighborhood called Utopia, only the street called Utopia Parkway. This was Flushing, he said. Was Google wrong? Well, maybe just confused. The layout of Utopia, according to Community Board 8. (Photo: (c) 2016 Google) Turns out, it was foolish to follow Google so blindly. According to the Community Board 8 website, Utopia has a clearly defined geography, south of where it is marked on Google Maps. The demarcated area runs from Utopia Parkway and Union Turnpike to 188th street and up to 73rd Avenue. I headed to a stretch on Union Turnpike, where Jewish delis coexist with Chinese supermarkets and Mexican taquerias.  “Truth of the matter is, there is no utopia in any place unfortunately. We just try to maintain sanity and goodness as much as you can,” says Tami Hirsch, sipping a cappuccino inside Lulu’s Bakery, an Italian-American bakery on Union Turnpike. Hirsch has lived in Utopia for 50 years, and speaks in glowing terms about a friendly, prosperous and family-oriented place; a hidden jewel in New York City. She knows the area better than most people, as she is the president of the Civic Association of Utopia Estates. Tami Hirsch, president of the Civic Association of Utopia Estates. (Photo: Jack Goodman) The Civic Association’s motto “We Are Our Neighbors Keepers”, has a distinct air of utopianism. The group meets four times a year and, says Hirsch, regularly lobbies local politicians on behalf of its residents. Whereas the fortunes of some parts of New York City rise and fall, Utopia has remained consistently pleasant, she says. It isn’t clear how the Utopia neighborhood came into existence. Unlike the Utopia Parkway, the neighborhood was never officially named. The district manager of the Community Board, Marie Adam-Ovide, says it is more of a sub-section of the Fresh Meadows neighborhood. And Tami Hirsch’s Civic Association, says Adam-Ovide, probably has a lot to do with the fact Utopia even exists at all. Utopia, Queens, doesn’t appear on business addresses. Charles Tola, the owner of Lulu’s Bakery, says he knows some people call the area Utopia, but he’s only ever used Fresh Meadows for business purposes. Other nearby establishments and homes are listed as Fresh Meadows or Flushing. To confuse matters further, Wikimapia, Google Maps, the New York City census map, Community Board 8 and locality.nyc all provide different boundaries for Utopia.  The post office along Union Turnpike. (Photo: Jack Goodman) Although it seems like an appealing designation for real estate purposes, too—who wouldn’t prefer to live in a neighborhood named Utopia?—local agents are more pragmatic. “No one has ever referred to it as Utopia,” says David Yudell, a real estate agent for Exit Realty, based in the area. When described over the phone, Yudell says that area is really Fresh Meadows, or part of Flushing.  Yet Utopia, Queens, clearly does exist, at least to the people who are aware they live in it. As the area changes and more people move in and out, it may be up to idealistic civic associations like Tami Hirsch’s to make sure neighborhoods as small as Utopia have a future. We all deserve our own piece of paradise, well-defined or not. #utopias#new york city#utopia week Read Next Watch a Clip from the Glory Days of the Pageant Swimsuit Competition Recent Stories North Korean Officials Had No Idea What Their Hostages Were Signaling in This Photo The story of 83 American captives and the "Digit Affair."

However, Google's best app for VR content creation has been been an Android exclusive for quite some time. That all changes today as Cardboard Camera, which makes it easy to take 360 degree images complete with sound, is now available for iPhone. “VR photos taken with Cardboard Camera are three-dimensional panoramas that can transport you right back to the moment,” Google writes in a blog post. “Near things look near and far things look far. You can look around to explore the image in all directions, and even hear sound recorded while you took the photo to hear the moment exactly as it happened.” Related: Great Google Cardboard apps you should download The process of capturing a VR photos is more akin to shooting a video on the phone. Users must hold the phone vertically and then simply turn around as if they’re taking a panorama photo. The resulting images can then be viewed with a Google Cardboard VR headset. Google is also boosting the ability to share these images on both Android and iOS. Users can create their own virtual photo album and easily post to friends and family via emails, messages or by posting them on the web. Google says 5 million ‘moments’ have already been captured on Android.

This app had previously been released for Android devices only – now with an update to the Android app and a release to iOS, it’s available for iPhone and iPad too. Users will be able to quickly take spherical photos with their iPhone or iPad, piece by piece, then upload them to the internet with Google’s Cardboard Camera system. Google’s Cardboard Camera works with photos captured from all angles. SEE TOO: Pokemon GO for Google Cardboard (VR) confirmed The person capturing the photo takes one photo to begin – that photo is set in place according to the phone’s sensors in one section of a sphere. The user is encouraged to move around themselves in this sphere (visualized in the camera app), and fill out the entirety of said sphere. The end product is a visualization of a location. The user saves the image and can share with the world – or just one friend – so that they might also visit that location. This app also acts as a connection to Google Cardboard – the VR headset. Users can open this app, tap the Cardboard headset button, put their phone in the headset, and view a collection of spherical locations. This app captures and visualizes the locations – all in one – so that the experience can be made as simple as possible for the end user. This is the latest in Google’s collection of VR initiatives, most recently touching down on the brand Google Daydream. This is the next-gen slightly higher-up vision from the same group that brought on Google Cardboard.

With the launch of iOS 10, Apple adds RAW support to select iOS devices with DNG (iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, SE, 7, 7 Plus, and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro), the same file format many Android users have had access to since the launch of Lollipop 5.0 over a year ago. But what exactly is RAW photography and DNG anyway – and what’s the big deal? Smartphones traditionally snap the very familiar JPEG file that’s easily (and instantly) shareable. JPEGs are automatically edited and adjusted by the software built into the camera or smartphone so they’re ready to go. The downside is that JPEGs are heavily compressed. RAW file types, such as DNG, on the other hand, are untouched by that automatic software, leaving more of the photo’s data intact. The untouched RAW file, whether opened on a desktop program or a mobile photo editor, offers more flexibility in retouching than a JPEG that’s already been processed. As you might suspect, the tradeoff is that RAW files tend to be very large. Please enable Javascript to watch this video The iOS 10 update, slated for release on September 13, will allow users to swap between the traditional JPEG and a DNG RAW file in third-party apps (Apple’s native camera app, however, won’t shoot in RAW). Several Android cameras (largely high-end options released since Lollipop 5.0) offer the option of RAW shooting in the native app or through third-party apps. Since DNG files are larger than JPEGs, the user will have the option to turn the feature on and off. “RAW photography means you don’t actually have to make all of the choices when you are taking a photograph.” While DNG may sound complex, the original idea behind the untouched file type is actually the opposite. Thomas Knoll, Photoshop’s original co-creator who worked with Adobe to develop DNG in 2004, says that the goal of DNG is actually to make photography easier. “[RAW photography] means you don’t actually have to make all of the choices when you are taking a photograph,” said Knoll, a self-proclaimed amateur photographer himself. “If you make a mistake on how you set up the camera, often, it’s trivial to fix when you are processing the RAW file afterward. I’ve always thought that RAW formats, compared to JPEG, make photography easier to do.” Related: Google code hints of RAW + JPEG capture in Android camera app With a JPEG, the camera automatically sets in information like the white balance and applies a sharpening algorithm. And while even a RAW file can’t recover from extreme exposure errors, the untouched file type is more forgiving, giving the photographer more control, by allowing the parameters that the computer automatically sets for a JPEG to be adjusted manually in a number of different desktop and mobile applications. White balance errors are particularly easy to adjust, while RAW files also allow for fine-tuning the exposure by enhancing the darks and lights of the image separately.

DNG support also allows mobile photographers to edit RAW files while on the go. In the past, working photographers would need to either download and edit the files on a desktop later, or carry a laptop with them. With RAW support in Adobe Lightroom Mobile running on powerful tablet like the iPad Pro, a photographer could edit photos remotely without carrying a laptop, or waiting until he or she gets back to a studio. And when using Adobe’s Creative Sync platform, any changes made to a photo are reflected across devices. “RAW means you don’t actually have to make all of the choices when you are taking a photograph.” There are a few downsides to working with RAW, like the larger file sizes that can slow down the camera. RAW files also have to be edited and saved as a JPEG before sharing online. But the editing flexibility is often considered worth the extra hassle, especially for images that be later edited anyway. So if RAW photography is more forgiving, why did RAW build a reputation as a complex process? Part of that stems from accessibility issues, Knoll said. Different brands have different types of RAW files – Nikon users will see a NEF after the file name, for example, while Canon shooters will see a CR2. When new cameras are released, sometimes the manufacturer adjusts just how those files are processed, which means those new files are no longer accessible by programs older than the camera. The compatibility issue was a big complaint among consumers – and one that Knoll himself had when he purchased a camera with a RAW format that Photoshop didn’t yet support in 2002. That’s when Knoll decided to work on developing Adobe Camera RAW, a software that takes different RAW file types and converts them into a universal format so that they can still be opened in older versions of the software. That’s when DNG was born. Colby Brown/Adobe Unedited RAW photo from a Nexus 6P, by Colby Brown. Colby Brown/Adobe Edited RAW photo from a Nexus 6P, by Colby Brown. DNG is a standard RAW file that’s universally accessible. Unlike brand-specific RAW formats, DNG is publicly documented so manufacturers and software engineers can utilize the format. That allowed camera manufacturers like Leica – and now Android and Apple – to easily incorporate RAW capability. Some brands may use different compression methods to create a smaller file or handle the data in slightly different ways, but on an image quality level, Knoll explained, there isn’t a difference between NEF, CR2, and DNG. When a new camera is released, Knoll and the team at Adobe works to break down the file type into data about the camera’s physical characteristics and the image’s metadata, then add the conversion into Adobe Camera RAW. The RAW converter acts as a go-between to solve compatibility issues between different RAW types and software, often with programs that haven’t yet been updated to include the new camera model. While many brands still choose to use their own RAW format, DNG provides a standard benchmark and allows users of new cameras to convert their files for use in older software programs. Different brands may use different compression methods in their files, but as an Adobe-developed file type, DNG’s structure includes Fast Load Preview data that allows for faster editing inside Lightroom and Adobe Camera RAW. The DNG format is also considered safer for archival photographs – as a standard, it’s likely that software programs 20 years down the road will still be able to access those files. The basic structure behind a DNG file has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in 2004, although advances now allow for working with high dynamic range and panorama stitching. DNG’s universal use is the main reason why smartphone manufacturers are choosing to use that format, Knoll said. If Google and Apple had decided to develop their own RAW format, app developers would need to release an update for every new smartphone upgrade in order to maintain compatibility with images from that model. Adobe Photoshop Co-Creator, Thomas Knoll “The whole vision of DNG was to avoid the Tower of Babel issue where every new camera that comes out requires a change in the format and a new software update on every reader of that format,” Knoll said. “As the number of cameras increase and the number of software applications that process RAW format increase, it becomes a geometric explosion, whereas if you have a standard format, both programs can be used literally without any complexity problems.” Smartphone photography’s move into RAW could open up more possibilities for why the medium exploded in the first place. While smartphones made photo editing quick, DNG now also makes editing apps more capable. And while smartphones have made photography simpler and more accessible, Knoll said that access to the untouched data through RAW makes correcting some novice mistakes possible in ways that JPEGs couldn’t achieve. “[The availability of DNG] will improve the ease of use for smartphone camera technology in producing quality results,” Knoll said.

Resend activation e-mail Cars Technica / All things automotive Trouble ahead for Google’s and Apple’s car projects? Google is yet to find a partner, and Apple is letting go of engineers. by Jonathan M. Gitlin - Sep 12, 2016 6:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 151 Aurich Lawson That Apple and Google would have an interest in cars is not surprising; the automobile of 2016 is as much a tech product as it is a vehicle. That trend is only accelerating as self-driving technology continues to mature. But over the past few days, we've seen a flurry of speculation over the automotive projects at two of the world's biggest tech companies. Let's start with Google. The Mountain View-based search giant has been working on its autonomous transport project since 2009—which may as well be forever in tech years. It started with modified Toyotas and Lexuses, then more recently with electric vehicles of its own design. The high-profile nature of Google (and therefore its car project) has arguably helped get people to take the prospect of autonomous driving more seriously than they otherwise might have. In 2012 when Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law legislation in California to allow testing of autonomous vehicles on the road, he did so at Google's HQ. But it has not been smooth sailing for Google's car project; at various times it has been linked to partnerships with Uber, Ford, General Motors, and Fiat-Chrysler. However, only the last of those collaborators has panned out; Ford is going at it alone to build an autonomous ride-sharing vehicle in 2021, and Uber is working with Volvo on a similar vehicle (and with a similar time frame). Despite having seven years of experience—and 1.5 million miles—under its belt, it's possible that Tesla's approach of using fleet learning that leverages tens of thousands of vehicles has given the young upstart a big advantage. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that Google's car project is beset by frustration and a lack of focus as it loses "its first-mover advantage to other companies pursuing more practical, less-ambitious self-driving car services." Several long-time veterans have moved on recently, possibly after butting heads with John Krafcik, who was brought in as CEO of the car project last year. Meanwhile, we've written very little about Apple's possible car plans here at Ars, but the idea of an Apple Car wasn't actually as outlandish as it might seem. The company has enormous cash reserves that need something to do, and outsourcing production to a firm like Steyr or Valmet is something that even long-time automakers like Porsche have done in the past. Unlike Google's well-publicized automotive adventure, though, concrete details about Apple's "Project Titan" are extremely hard to come by. Last February, we heard that Apple had several hundred people working on the project, and battery maker A123 sued Apple for poaching some of its staff. Elon Musk even referred to Apple as the "Tesla Graveyard" when asked whether he was scared of Cupertino muscling in on his turf. Beyond that, there have been plenty of rumors about Apple's plans but nothing concrete. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Project Titan is in trouble, however, as there are engineering layoffs and a scaling back of the project's scope. According to the Times, Apple is no longer considering building its own car, perhaps intending to partner with an existing automaker instead. We shall have to watch this space to see if that approach works better in Cupertino than it has in Mountain View. Expand full story Reader comments 151 You must login or create an account to comment.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Uber buys Otto, folks leave Google, Ford goes big, Tesla dumps MobilEye Submitted by brad on Thu, 2016-08-18 15:18. Robocars The past period has seen some very big robocar news. Real news, not the constant “X is partnering with Y” press releases that fill the airwaves some times. Uber has made a deal to purchase Otto, a self-driving truck company I wrote about earlier founded by several friends of mine from Google. The rumoured terms of the deal as astronomical — possibly 1% of Uber’s highly valued stock (which means almost $700M) and other performance rewards. I have no other information yet on the terms, but it’s safe to say Otto was just getting started with ambitious goals and would not have sold for less than an impressive amount. For a company only 6 months old, the rumoured terms surpass even the amazing valuation stories of Cruise and Zoox. While Otto has been working on self-driving technology for trucks, any such technology can also move into cars. Uber already has an active lab in Pittsburgh, but up to now has not been involved in long haul trucking. (It does do local deliveries in some places.) There are many startups out there calling themselves the “Uber for Trucks” and Otto has revealed it was also working on shipping management platform tools, so this will strike some fear into those startups. Because of my friendship with Otto’s team, I will do more commentary when more details become public. In other Uber news, Uber has announced it will sell randomly assigned Uber rides in their self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh. If your ride request is picked at random (and because it’s in the right place) Uber will send one of their own cars to drive you on your ride, and will make the ride free, to boot. Of course, there will be an Uber safety driver in the vehicle monitoring it and ready to take over in any problem or complex situation. So the rides are a gimmick to some extent, but if they were not free, it would be a sign of another way to get customers to pay for the cost of testing and verifying self-driving cars. The free rides, however, will probably actually cause more people to take Uber rides hoping they will win the lottery and get not simply the free ride but the self-driving ride. GM announced a similar program for Lyft — but not until next year. Ford also goes all-in, but with a later date Ford has announced it wants to commit to making unmanned capable taxi vehicles, the same thing Uber, Google, Cruise/GM, Zoox and most non-car companies want to make. For many years I have outlined the difference between the usual car company approaches, which are evolutionary and involve taking cars and improving their computers and the approaches of the non-car companies which bypass all legacy thinking (mostly around ADAS) to go directly to the final target. I call that “taking a computer and putting wheels on it.” It’s a big and bold move for Ford to switch to the other camp, and a good sign for them. They have said they will have a fleet of such vehicles as soon as 2021. Other companies have announced plans to go for unmanned capable taxi vehicles, particularly Daimler and BMW, but they still maintain active “evolutionary” projects which hope to build on their prior ADAS work. Velodyne The other big news is that Ford, together with Baidu have made a $150M investment in Velodyne. Velodyne has been for a decade the primary supplier of LIDARs for robocar research projects, but their LIDARs are research instruments, high performance at high cost. In the meantime, other companies (such as Quanergy, for whom I am an advisor) have been pushing to make better priced LIDARs for real production. The Velodynes have been the right choice, because it is smart to research with what’s expensive today, knowing it will get cheap in the future. Baidu’s test cars have had Velodynes on them, but there were recent rumours of Baidu experimenting with alternatives to LIDAR, but this investment may counter those rumours. This investment will move Velodyne more to a lower cost production unit, though at present at a higher cost than the solid-state plans of Quanergy and some others. Google Departures Otto included a few people from Google’s car team. It was also recently revealed that Chris Urmson, who had run the team for most of its existence and was moved to “CTO” after the arrival of John Krafcik, has departed. I worked for Chris but he has not told me his reason for departure. In general, Google’s car team has gotten huge, and the recently departed people are mostly folks who were among the first 20 on the team. This may simply be a sign of massive expansion, I have not heard much to credit the idea that there is some sort of internal chaos. In addition, deals like the Otto deal will certainly cause people to consider if they want to work for a big corporation or break out on their own. MobilEye A few weeks ago, MobilEye issued a press release that they would not be supplying the next generation of their EyeQ chips to Tesla. The EyeQ4 is a great deal more sophisticated than the EyeQ3 that Telsa uses, and Tesla even uses an older version with a more limited set of features — including, most famously, the inability to detect things like cross traffic. Since MobilEye announced it, it seems like it was their decision (You don’t usually issue a press release to say you have been dumped by a smaller customer.) It caused their stock to take a quick big hit (Disclaimer, I own a small amount) on the day of the announcement, but it recovered reasonably well. Tesla’s stock was not affected. Tesla folks have always claimed that they only made minimal use of ME’s functionality, and that the real special sauce was theirs. ME folks have claimed the opposite. This break-up will settle that question, and presumably Tesla has been working on alternatives for a while as they don’t seem to be in much panic about it. Tesla has made announcements of plans for their new hardware and those plans look very similar to the EyeQ4, so they must have had their own parallel research underway. » brad's blog Question Submitted by Bill D (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 16:41. Brad, Any thoughts about the MIT / DARPA announcement they might be able to design lidars on a chip to be priced at around $10 each Does that seem feasible to you? Significant? http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/optoelectronics/mit-li... » reply Solid state Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-08-19 00:24. This project is attempting to do a solid state LIDAR, which is also the goal of Quanergy. Quanergy is much further along, and others hope to do the same thing. The $10 price point is when you are making many millions of the chip, and yes, anything that can go on one chip in those quantities can get a cost that low, though usually you add a few other things beyond the chip. Whether it is this, or Quanergy, or other companies working on it, low cost LIDAR is definitely coming, and will be used on all robocars, I predict, even Tesla (though Elon has sworn otherwise.) Or at least it will until there is some remarkable breakthrough in computer vision. Which is not impossible, but not here yet. I expect the cheap lidars are sooner. But if you have cheap lidar and cheap camera you use both, of course, at least for the first decade. » reply Current cost of lidar Submitted by Bo Nordlin (not verified) on Fri, 2016-08-19 03:13. Brad, I highly appreciate your writing. What are the current cost of lidars in an autonomous vehicle, and what has been the typical yearly price reduction so far? » reply Current cost Submitted by brad on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:09. There is no standard LIDAR. Velodyne makes several products ranging from $8,000 to $75,000. Valeo sells a simple 4 plane designed by Ibeo for $250 but it’s not really suitable for self-driving. Quanergy has a $1,000 8 laser unit being tested by some automakers. There are a few other research ones out there. Many companies have this in development, they only just figured it out a while ago. It is reasonable to expect that suitable LIDARs will be under $250, perhaps far under, but you may need more than one. » reply Quanergy et al chip based LiDAR RANGE Submitted by Rutt Bridges (not verified) on Sun, 2016-08-21 18:59. Brad, While I have seen multiple stories about chip-based LiDAR (mostly re: Quanergy), the one thing I haven't see is a spec on range. While the cost-effectiveness of these units could be a real breakthrough for driverless vehicles, if the range is under 100 feet their application will be quite limited. Have you seen or heard any quotes on range? » reply Range Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-08-22 03:25. Range for LIDARs is more a function of their light frequency and eye safety rules. You can’t emit so much power that it would be dangerous to the eye. At that maximum power, you can go about 100m on a dark object and still be seen coming back (against the sun.) You can go further on brighter objects, and most objects are brighter, but you have to focus on that minimum range. » reply More sensitive lidar Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:33. Brad, there's an Israeli company working on more sensitive lidar sensors with a better range. » reply That is true Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-10-28 16:40. They are in my queue to write about » reply Don't forget the poaching of Apple's talent Submitted by Mario Herger (not verified) on Thu, 2016-08-18 19:41.

Then the billboards all over highway 101 about the nano-degree in self-driving by Sebastian Thrun's Udacity It's astonishing the tempo that this has taken and accelerating... » reply ... but Apple also picked up an entire company's worth of PhDs Submitted by David Rostcheck (not verified) on Mon, 2016-08-22 08:52. Apple just bought Turi (nee Dato, nee GraphLab). In doing so they acquired the GraphLab Create and Turi Distributed platforms, nice toolkits that accelerate common Machine Learning tasks. However, those don't seem to fit with Apple's product portfolio at all. However they also acquired 50+ data scientists, most with PhDs. To me it looks like perhaps it's an acqui-hire, so they can use those resources on their internal ML projects (cough-self-driving-car-cough). Disclaimer: I'm an evangelist for Turi (i.e. a run a users' group for them, for which I get no cash compensation but do get the occasional perk like a conference ticket). However, I have no special knowledge about their business internals and this is speculation on my part. » reply Tesla & maps Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sat, 2016-08-20 11:22. Hi, have you heard any news on tesla negotiating with a global mapmaker? I heard it here (webinar on high definition maps) http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation/automot... » reply Taxi model Submitted by Bejoy (not verified) on Mon, 2016-09-12 02:45. Hi Brad Given the pace at which taxi firms are trying to develop autonomous cars and autonomous car developers are increasingly foreseeing a car-on-demand model for the SDC operations, it remains to be seen how car owners/operators will prevent people from misusing the cars - Misusing meaning everything from pure vandalism and dirtying the car to outright car jacking/ using as a self-guided ballistic missile? Would you know if these firms have something in mind to prevent such incidents? » reply Rental cars Submitted by brad on Mon, 2016-09-12 11:12. Are these issues different from the issues with rental cars (Hertz) or carshare (Zipcar)? If they don’t have a wheel, you can’t use them as a missile (unless you physically alter the car, which again you can do with any rental car.) » reply You are right! Autonomous Submitted by Bejoy John (not verified) on Fri, 2016-09-16 02:45. You are right! Autonomous cars as missiles seem to be less of a threat. But when it comes to rental cars or car share, at the end of the day, the guy who takes it out has to face the owner of the car when handing it back. That leaves them kind of "obliged" to take care of the car in their custody, which is what prevents people from vandalizing the vehicle. Even a contract to take care of the car is useless if the car owner isn't around to track vandalism and take defaulters to task. Compare that to public toilets where no one is watching you use it and you don't have to face the owner(the govt., public utility cos). So people do not care so much and just use and leave it as they feel. Even facing another user doesn't seem to have the same effect as facing the owner. I see an analog in current business models of autonomous cars - nobody is watching you use it and the car just goes to the next guy who wants to use it. That made me wonder if such consumer behavior is already factored in (but maybe not announced) by autonomous car companies or is it that measures to counter such behavior need to be developed. » reply I have a number of articles on this topic Submitted by brad on Fri, 2016-09-16 10:36. Mostly related to the privacy problems because taxi owners will indeed want cameras to stop damage (mostly accidental) to cars as well as people leaving their stuff in them. My current model is as you leave (to stop the meter running) you flip the lever on the camera’s cover, it takes a photo after you are out, and compares it to the photo before you got in, and if there’s a difference, it is examined. In most cases it’s, “You left your bag in the car” but sometimes it’s “You spilled your drink or puked” and the car goes to the car wash and you get the bill. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

There’s no question that images boost visibility, engagement and click-through rates. A study on Google+ concluded that posts with images were shared three times more than those without images. Likewise, Socialbakers reported that of the top 10 percent most engaging Facebook posts (likes, shares, comments), 93 percent of them were photos. And a study by BrightLocal found that 60 percent of consumers agreed that local results with images grab their attention and influence decision-making. The opposite is also true: A lack of images hurts. Indeed, Expedia has used the threat of pulling images to gain leverage in business deals with hotel chains. It’s a practice called “dimming” that reduces a property’s visibility and marketability in hotel listings served to users of the online site. Expedia is trying to stop hotel chains from offering lower rates on their own branded websites than they give to the online booking services. Pulling images from listings makes those hotels less attractive to a consumer and more likely that he or she will select a different hotel. Huffington Post quotes Christine Compo-Martin, a retired teacher, as saying, “Honestly, if there aren’t pictures, I don’t even begin to consider it.” If enough consumers pass over the dimmed listings, Expedia hopes the hotels will be pressured to accommodate their pricing demands. With such importance placed on images, it is somewhat surprising that search has lagged in adoption of images as part of the search result. The major US search engines, Google and Bing, generally return text-based results. Many directory listings like the BBB are traditionally NAP+ information-based (with NAP standing for name, address, phone number) or require a premium before images may be included, like the print Yellow Pages. That appears to be changing as Google and Bing are challenged by newer or vertical specific search platforms. Yelp has profile pictures for virtually all of its listings. In response, Google started using logos or images in its local search “snack pack” results last year. Currently, images are included in listings or search results in a variety of ways and without any real consistency across different platforms. Below is a summary of how and when images appear based on my personal search results over this past week: Google local search snack pack — desktop and mobile: Images are displayed in search results only for certain categories such as food and beverage, ballet schools, hotels and entertainment (not a complete list). Examples of listings with no images: dance studios, plumbers, clothing/fashion, pool supplies, attorneys. Google Maps — desktop: All listings contain images. Google Maps — mobile: Images are included only for those categories with images in snack pack results. Google mobile app — Android: Knowledge graph with image when location intent expressed (e.g., “Twisted Root, Plano”). Google mobile app — iOS: Thumbnail pic with listing for very specific searches with single result matches (e.g., “Stanley Cleaners Frisco”). Search for “Twisted Root, Plano” resulted in multiple listings without pics, even though there was only one location in Plano. Of course, pictures always appear when your business is selected from search results and the business profile or knowledge graph is displayed. But as you can see, it’s not easy to understand the reasoning behind why some images are displayed in local search listings. For instance, why do images display in search results for ballet schools and not dance studios? Nevertheless, we’re likely in the middle of a transition process, and chances are, images will only be used more frequently, not less. Even with the unpredictability of Google’s image selection, there are some good practices you can adapt to make sure you get the most out of your images in local search listings. The following eight tips will pay off in the long term and even make a difference in the near term. 1. Don’t default to Google’s image selection Even if you don’t claim your Google My Business profile or upload a photo, Google can still assign a picture to your business’s listing. It might be something as simple as a Google Street View image of the outside of your business, which can be something of a crapshoot. Sometimes, those images include an identifying store sign or a picture of your storefront. Other times, the picture may be of a brick wall next to your property or an unflattering angle of the strip mall where your store is located. Google also has “local guides,” registered users incentivized to take pictures of stores, venues and places by a points-based rewards system. These local guides snap photos, upload them and tag businesses to them. The general public can also post pictures directly to a business’s Google listing with just a few clicks on their phone. Often times, these are pictures of favorite dishes or fancy drinks or a great band playing at your venue. But they can also upload undesirable images. Advice Local first spotted the prank photo below, taken inside a store and uploaded by a user to the business’s Google listing. Google bots selected the photo as the profile image. Not exactly what you want your customers to see. Google Profile Image Fail Take control of your own destiny, and don’t let a Google bot decide what works best for your business. 2. Set your profile image in Google My Business Google allows you to select a profile photo, logo and cover photo, as well as additional interior and exterior shots of your business, your team, work in action and others when logged into your Google My Business account. Note that Google reserves the right to determine which photo is shown first, despite your selection. Google doesn’t disclose the algorithm it uses to select photos for you, but it does give a few tips as to some factors it considers. Google will determine how well the photo represents your business’s service or product and uses pictures of food as an example of what works well for restaurants. Other factors include the format, size, resolution and quality of the picture. Uploading photos you believe are the best representation of your business (and your products and services) lays the foundation for an attractive and compelling profile image that appears in search results. 3. Change it up if you don’t get the image you want displayed If you’re having trouble getting the picture you select to appear as your profile pic, try mixing it up. I toyed around with Local Search Association’s Google profile and used a cropped logo as the profile pic. Google didn’t like that; instead it selected a goofy Christmas pic of our staff that I’d uploaded to team photos. When I deleted that picture, Google then (given the limited options) restored the original cropped logo pic as our profile pic. So try different things like uploading higher-resolution pics, cropping them differently, placing them in a different order, uploading other angles of the same shot, brightening the contrast or whatever other tinkering you can do, as it might make Google change its bot brain and give you what you want. The Bed Bath & Beyond store mentioned in tip #1 above uploaded a couple of new pics and was successful in getting Google to switch profile pics just last week. Pizzeria Testa (below) has an ugly picture of the back side of the restaurant as its profile. It needs to work to get its much nicer storefront (or any of the other images) set as its profile by trying a few changes. Google Profile Image — Better options available 4. Check back frequently Google is forever tinkering with making its product better for consumers, which means that you should expect constant change. Two weeks ago, I looked at the Google listing for my daughter’s ballet school, Chamberlain School of Ballet, and the profile pic displayed was an interior shot of one of the studios. Last week, the image was changed to the school’s logo. Both photos were uploaded in 2013 and no new pics have been added recently, so it isn’t a change resulting from new activity. This change is consistent with online reports about profile pics being switched unexpectedly and without input from the profile owner. Make sure to check your profile images on all platforms and devices frequently for changes that may not be what you want. Alternately, make sure all the pictures you upload are at least acceptable as a profile pic. Then, no matter which image Google selects — or whenever it initiates changes — those other images will work, at least until you can make adjustments. 5. Use a high-quality image Google isn’t the only one that values high-quality images. Consumers do, too. The National Retail Federation reports that 67 percent of consumers say that the quality of a product image is very important in selecting and purchasing products online. This number is almost 15 percentage points higher than the number of consumers who believe ratings and reviews are very important in selecting a product or business in that same report. So if you are using a picture of your product or service as your profile image, it will directly impact consumer sentiment about your business.  And it affects both the perception of your product quality and the trustworthiness of your business.  A study by Stanford showed that over 46 percent of consumers felt website design was the top criterion for deciding whether a company is credible or not. With the abundance of information being contained within listings today, many consumers are not making the leap to a business website anymore. The enhanced listings become a de facto “web page” of the business, and with images playing such a big part in illustrating a business’s identity, it is important that its profile image reflect well. Google will also crop and blow up cropped photos to fit different sized displays (see below), so make sure your photo is of high enough quality to not become pixelated when manipulated. 6. Ensure the image is framed to display properly in various sizes and formats Even the best professional photo won’t work if it is not properly formatted or cropped or framed. Make sure the subject of your photos is centered, and anticipate that it will be framed in thumbnail portraits for mobile listings, cropped square for snack pack listings and formatted for landscape cover photos in full map listings. I’ll let the below pictures do the talking in illustrating what can happen to even the best photos if you don’t plan ahead on how they might be framed or cropped. Professional photos for Google Profile Image   Google Profile Images – failure to properly frame photo 7. Be cautious about using stock images Some stock images are beautifully shot and have an artistic flair that I’ll never capture myself. I used a stock image from picjumbo as a header in a LinkedIn post about one of my other articles. But often times, stock images are easy to spot. Sometimes, it is the result of overuse of a particular image; other times, it’s the lighting that makes it look like a screen shot from a soap opera. Whatever it is, when consumers detect or suspect that an image isn’t real, it hurts the local business’s reputation of authenticity. Being genuine and trustworthy are among the local business’s strongest assets. A picture that might have a few flaws but that shows your true and local identity is better than a perfect picture that everyone knows isn’t real. 8. Don’t forget about images in non-Google listings Whether it be local listings in broad directories such as YellowPages.com and Yelp or vertical specific listings such as Avvo or OpenTable, all offer accounts for you to manage your online profile and include images. Don’t “dim” yourself out of these sites that can deliver significant traffic to your local business. Examples of self-dimmed profile images on YP.com, OpenTable, Avvo and Yelp Final thoughts In closing, images are critical to conveying information about your business and in forming your online reputation and identity as consumers search for local products and services. Yet it is surprising how many businesses fail to manage and monitor images that are associated with their store or service. Images may be one of the most effective ways you can distinguish yourself from the competition. Just make sure you create a positive impression and not a negative one. Keep these tips in mind, and you should vastly improve the way potential customers see you.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Over the past few months, seemingly every detail of HTC’s “Sailfish, said to be part of Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone lineup, has leaked out. From the device’s specs to its alleged design; the handset isn’t exactly a mystery, which means we’re simply waiting for Google to officially unveil it. Ahead of that official unveiling, Android Authority has provided yet another look at the device, this time in the form of a 360-degree render. As far as Nexus devices go, it’s not the most attractive design we’ve ever seen; no better or worse than the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P duo. As the previous leaked photos revealed, the handset is fairly plain, save for the piece of glass on the rear panel. Because these are just renders, the final design of Sailfish could be different by the time Google unveils the device, reportedly on Oct. 4. According to previous leaks, the handset will sport a 5-inch Full HD display, Snapdragon 820 chip, USB-C, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, 2,700mAh battery, and a 12-megapixel camera.

The latest in a line of tech giants who showed their interest in the fashion industry launched a special search feature this week. Google provides updates throughout Fashion Month.   With the help of former Maxim editor Kate Lanphear (The New York Times called her the Eva Chen of Google) the company built a unique search feature that will last the duration of fashion month, WWD reported. If you search “fashion week” or “designer + fashion week” you’ll be welcomed with up-to-the-second news and information from designers and brands, plus a calendar of shows, so you’ll know what to check and when. Users will even be able to shop looks from brands like Burberry and Tom Ford as they walk down the runway, WWD reported. Google’s feature debuted just before the new Style.com (Condé Nast’s new luxury e-commerce site), which was re-introduced to the fashion world on Friday, The Cut reported. Pre-Vogue Runway the site was the place to go for runway reports and images. Now Style.com is promising to be the best in online shopping, but there’s a catch – for now the new site is only available in the UK. .@styledotcom's new luxury e-commerce site is live. Fashion Director @yasminsewell discusses the site's mission: https://t.co/aZqpIKJFyU — Vogue Magazine (@voguemagazine) September 2, 2016 Sounds like Google stepped in at the right moment. With so many bloggers, social media stars and brands now devoted to live-streaming shows there is sure to be nothing less than a whirlwind of information available on whatever collection interests you.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Pokemon Go App Update With Buddy Pokemon Roll Out Slowed Posted: Sep 12 2016, 11:43am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Sep 12 2016, 11:51am CDT, in News | Technology News   Pokemon Go app 0.37.0 for Android and Pokemon Go App 1.7.0 for iOS   The new Pokemon Go app update has been announced on Saturday. Niantic announced Pokemon Go app 0.37.0 for Android and Pokemon Go App 1.7.0 for iOS on Saturday. Many Android users reported that they can download the new Pokemon Go app with Buddy Pokemon from the Google Play store. There are though now many comments in social media of Android users in the US, Europe and elsewhere that they still can't get the Pokemon Go app 0.37.0. It appears the roll out as slowed down or even stopped. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock Google Play is rolling out gradually to Google Play users, not necessarily by region. The Pokemon Go 1.7.0 update for iOS is not yet released at all.  Android users have the venue of installing the Pokemon Go 0.37.0 APK directly. The file has been made available on APK mirror sites right after the release. iOS users are stuck waiting for the iTunes store to release the 1.7.0 release. It reason for the slow roll out could be bugs. We just do not know at this point. Niantic has a bad start with communications. Now they are updating the trainer community regularly with updates on upcoming features. What is missing now is guidance on specific release times. This might not be as easy, as Niantic depends on Google and Apple to get the update live in the respective app store. If the new Pokemon Go updates are not fully rolling out today, Niantic needs to act and update the trainer community. Those who can use the new Pokemon Go Buddy feature have already discovered an Easter egg. Walking Pikachu for 10km makes him change from the ground to your shoulder. There might be more Easter eggs hidden in the new Pokemon Buddy feature.  There is another "dark" feature in the new Pokemon Go app release. Niantic prevents the new Pokemon App to run on rooted or jailbroken devices. This has raised a shit storm in the huge rooted Android community. There are though several work arounds available to run the new Pokemon Go app on rooted Android devices.  Using the Xposed Framework with the RootCloak Module appears to be the easiest method. The new Pokemon Go update also supports the Pokemon Go Plus device, that will be released on Friday. Despite the decreasing hype, the Pokemon Go game has been downloaded 500 million times so far. The AR game is the fastest mobile game ever to reach that milestone. The story of Pokemon Go has just begun.

Robert Epstein estimated that biased suggestions could shift up to three million votes in the upcoming November election in an article explaining his findings for Sputnik News. Epstein said his research followed up claims in a viral video released by Sourcefed in June, which alleged the tech giant was tinkering with its search suggestions to cast Clinton in a positive light. The video, narrated by Matt Lieberman, used numerous examples to demonstrate that various searches related to Clinton appeared to yield only positive suggestions – despite Google Trends showing negative searches were common. This occurred despite other search engines, including Bing and Yahoo, giving both positive and negative searches. Scroll down for video  A research psychologist has detailed the results of an investigation which he says shows how Google is manipulating its results to favor Hillary Clinton (above) Google responded by insisting that the company favors no candidate or cause – but admitted searches are censored. In a blog post in June, the company said: ‘The autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person’s name with terms that are offensive or disparaging. ‘This filter operates according to the same rules no matter who the person is.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next She's phoning it in!

Share this article Share 516 shares But notably, Lieberman found that Google showed autocomplete did produce negative results for Bernie Sanders - Clinton’s opponent for the Democratic nomination – and Donald Trump. Since then, Epstein and his colleagues at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology – which he explained is a non-profit and non-partisan organization – investigated Lierberman’s claims and found their results supported his, but clarified that the research is ongoing. Robert Epstein found that Google only gave positive results such as 'winning' and 'awesome' compared to Yahoo and Bing which yielded both positive and negative suggestions This is despite 'Hillary Clinton is a liar' proving to be a much more popular search term on Google Trends Google explained that it removes negative search suggestions, but searching for 'Donald Trump is' gave one bizarre option suggesting the GOP candidate is dead Epstein said he and his colleagues tested hundreds of election-related search terms. To ensure that searches were not customized to their personal search history by using proxy servers and the Tor network and clearing cache and cookies ‘fairly obsessively.’ But for Clinton, they appear to be withheld even when those same terms are proven to be extremely popular in Google Trends – thus disproving the company’s claim that autocomplete shows the most popular terms people are searching for. He also refuted Google’s explanation that this is because negative searches are universally withheld because his research found that they appear to be suppressed selectively. For example, Epstein showed screenshots of the results when he searched the term ‘Hillary Clinton is’ leaving a space after ‘is’ on August 3. Bing and Yahoo offered numerous negative suggestions to finish the phrase including liar, criminal and evil. But Google only gave two: ‘Hillary Clinton is winning’ and ‘Hillary Clinton is awesome.’ He also showed a Google Trends screenshot which showed that ‘Hillary Clinton is a liar’ was a far more popular search that either of the other two choices Google provided with autocomplete. However, as Google claims this is because it roots out negative results, then Epstein conducted the same search using Trump’s name – and found it gave two choices again. After Donald Trump dubbed Clinton 'Crooked Hillary,' searches for the term soared  But typing crooked into Google resulted in no suggestions for Clinton, whereas on Yahoo and Bing, 'Crooked Hillary' was in the top two results One was ‘Donald Trump is awesome’ but the other result was ‘Donald Trump is dead,’ which he suggests should have been filtered. Epstein showed how Google’s bias appears to extend to her running mate Tim Kaine. After Trump dubbed the Virginia senator ‘Corrupt Kaine’ – the term saw a massive surge in popularity on Google, proven by a screenshot from Google Trends on June 27 that Epstein provided. Despite this, when Epstein tried to conduct an autocomplete search for ‘Corrupt Ka’ – there were no results at all about Kaine. Epstein showed Google’s bias appears to extend to running mate Tim Kaine. Above, Google Trends showed searches for 'Corrupt Kaine' soared after Trump gave him the nickname Searching 'Corrupt Ka' on Google gives nothing about Kaine, but on Yahoo, just typing corrupt leads to a result about the Virginia senator A search on Yahoo, meanwhile, for simply the world ‘corrupt’ gave ‘Corrupt Kaine’ as the second suggested search. Similarly, Epstein says that the word ‘crooked’ generated no suggestions for Clinton in numerous searches in June and July even though the term ‘Crooked Hillary’ was popular due to Trump’s nickname for his rival. He said had to type ‘Crooked H-I-L-L-A’ before Google suggested to get a result for Clinton and even then, the suggested term was ‘Crooked Hillary Bernie.’ Both Bing and Yahoo, however, listed ‘Crooked Hilalry’ near the top of their suggestions lists. Epstein said that he found that Google searches were not always pro-Clinton and anti-Trump. SEARCHES RELATED TO HILLARY CLINTON'S HEALTH Searching for ‘Hillary Clinton hea’ on Google gives no indication that the candidate’s health issues are frequently searched Only typing 'h' after Clinton's name gives 'health' and 'health issues' as the top suggestions on Bing On Yahoo, only typing 'hill' is sufficient to give a number of searches about Clinton's health Google Trends shows that searches for 'Hillary Clinton health' have risen drastically since May But what he discovered was that Google allegedly mask their bias by suppressing only the most popular of the negative search terms. For instance, a search on August 2 generated no suggestions for ‘anti Hillary’ but did for ‘anti Clinton’ and ‘anti Hillary Clinton’ did. GOOGLE AND THE WHITE HOUSE The Obama administration has maintained a close relationship with Google over the years. In fact, numerous executives left the tech giant to land jobs in the White House. They include Megan Smith, is now the country’s chief technology officer, while Andrew McLaughlin, formerly Google’s head of global public policy, spent two years as the administration’s deputy chief technology officer. Other former employees who have spent time working for the government include Nicole Wong, who worked as deputy chief technology officer after leaving her role as vice president and deputy general counsel at Google. Meanwhile, former CEO Eric Schmidt who is now the chairman of Alphabet Inc, reportedly advised Obama’s 2008 campaign and acted as an informal adviser in 2012. And data released earlier this year showed the tech giant’s employees and affiliates have attended meetings at the White House more than once a week on average since President Barack Obama took office. The figures – based from Obama’s first week in office until October 2015 - showed 169 of the tech giant’s employees have met with 182 government officials in the White House. ‘Anti Trump’ however gave four results, including ‘anti Trump cartoon’ and ‘anti Trump song.’ ‘Anti Hillary’ consisted generated no results, he said, and found that the term was drawing much more traffic according to Google Trends than the others. ‘Google, it seems, is playing this game both consistently and slyly,’ Epstein writes. ‘It is saving its bias for the most valuable real estate — trending, high-value terms — and eliminating signs of bias for terms that have lost their value.’ Epstein also used a very recent example to demonstrate Google’s apparent bias. Questions surrounding Clinton’s health have dominated the news cycle recently – but Google autocomplete choices would suggest otherwise. Searching for ‘Hillary Clinton hea’ gives no indication that the candidate’s health is a frequently searched term – instead offering searches for health care, headquarters, hearing and headquarters chicago. Bing, on the other hand, gives health as a result even after only typing the letter ‘h’ after Clinton’s name as well as the term ‘health issues.’ Yahoo shows how dominant the issue is by giving the options ‘Hillary Clinton illness’ and ‘Hillary Clinton health issues’ after just typing ‘hill.’ A search conducted by DailyMail.com on Google today for the term ‘Hillary Clinton h’ yields nothing related to health – giving the choices ‘height, headquarters, hamilton and house’ instead. And for the record, Epstein notes that he supports Hillary Clinton for president. But he added: ‘I do not believe, however, that it would be right for her to win the presidency because of the invisible, large-scale manipulations of a private company. ‘That would make democracy meaningless, and that is why I am trying to keep the public informed about my research findings.’   Read more: SPUTNIK EXCLUSIVE: Research Proves Google Manipulates Millions to Favor Clinton Inside Search: Google Search Autocomplete Share or comment on this article e-mail 516 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

And in the realm of real-life tech, Google’s AI focus in recent years has similarly been to make computers sound more like us. And they’re getting much better at it. The latest development to come out of Google’s Deepmind AI is called WaveNet and it samples different parts of human speech and models its own waveforms after the way they sound. It’s not perfect yet, but we’re definitely getting closer to voices that sound like they come from a person’s mouth, rather than from a computer’s speaker. While it still sounds strange, the new AI speech certainly flows better than the kinds of responses you’ll get from Siri or Cortana, which chop up human speech and paste it back together in a way that makes individual pronunciations correct, but the flow of the speech is completely off. (That technique is known as concatenative text to speech, just so you know.) Related: Report: Digital assistants held back by poor microphone technology The WaveNet option flows much better because it uses something called parametric text to speech, which generates it from scratch. Where it differs from traditional uses of that technique though is that Google’s AI models its audio on the waveforms of real human voices. That’s difficult, because typically there are around 16,000 potential voice samples to be taken with every second of speech — that takes a lot of processing power to handle. To cut back on that, WaveNet uses a prediction engine to estimate what sample should come next in natural speech, using everything that has gone before as a guide. The results are impressive. To give you a comparison, here’s a classic concatenative text-to-speech system: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/us-english/parametric-1.wav That sounds like the sort of digital assistant voices we’re become used to in recent years. But here’s the new WaveNet system that Google has developed: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/us-english/wavenet-1.wav The cadence of the speech is much more realistic and though there is a general fuzziness to the audio, it’s not hard to imagine that being cleaned up post development. The process can even be used to simulate different kinds of voices, for example, male and female: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/knowing-what-to-say/second-list/speaker-1.wav https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/knowing-what-to-say/second-list/speaker-4.wav The only problem now is that even though its predictions reduce the amount of required processing for this technique, it still takes too much processing to imagine standard smartphone hardware being capable of doing it in real time. At least for now. For more information on these techniques, Google’s blog post offers a lot more detail and samples and it even posted a couple of papers on it here.

Truckers Say: Hit the Brakes Tweet  Print This   Otto SAN FRANCISCO — Walt Martin spent a decade as a longhaul truck driver, logging as many as 200,000 miles a year on the road. Now he’s back on the highway in the driver’s seat of a Volvo big rig, cruising the 280 freeway just south of town. Only he’s not driving — that task is being handled by self-driving truck technology built by Martin’s new employer, Otto. The 8-month-old start-up founded by Google Car veterans was just bought by ride-hailing giant Uber for $670 million. “Fully developed, this tech will allow truck drivers to add more hours and more runs to their schedule,” Otto test driver Martin said. “Any type of efficiencies will help.” But trucking professionals aren’t so sure. For reasons ranging from highway speeds to varying cargo requirements, trucking experts literally burst out laughing when asked about the notion of a driver sleeping while his truck barrels across a lonely state. “Is this all intriguing and promising? Yes,” says Sean McNally, spokesman for American Trucking Associations. “But are we skeptical? Yes.” RELATED: When self-driving vehicles take to the road, impact on jobs is uncertain Much is being written about the push to develop self-driving automobiles, with tech companies and automakers alike pumping human and financial capital into the quest while promising such transportation robots by 2021. But by focusing on automating trucks, Otto has vaulted from unknown to key player seemingly overnight. One co-founder, Anthony Levandowski, was tapped by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to oversee the $67 billion company’s self-driving efforts. Clearly, Kalanick saw the potential for Uber to own a piece of the massive U.S. trucking industry, which in 2015 brought in $726 billion in revenue and accounted for 81% of all freight transport, according to American Trucking Associations. Otto’s mission is as simple as its tech is complex. Sometime in the coming few years, it hopes to produce an aftermarket self-driving kit consisting of radar, laser radar, cameras and computers that can be added to existing big rig cabs. There’s no price yet, but Cruise Automation, which GM just bought for $1 billion, was charging $10,000 to add its autonomous-driving sensors to automobiles. Once on board, all this gadgetry would bring so-called Level 4 autonomy to a truck — in other words, the driver could sleep in the back while the truck drives itself on highways. All city driving would be handled by humans. “Often there are two questions for drivers," says Otto co-founder Lior Ron who, like Levandowski, used to work at Google. “Do you want to be safe, or do you want to make more money? And sometimes those two answers don’t add up.” Drivers are limited in terms of the number of consecutive hours they can drive. So a parked truck is a truck not making a delivery, not earning its keep. By enabling the vehicle to theoretically hit the road all night while the driver sleeps in the cab “could get the driver to his next destination, or home to his family, faster,” Ron said. Ford, Uber, Google and others are promising that same autonomy (Level 4 under the Department of Transportation's designations) — often in vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals — but for ride-hailing fleets plying dense urban centers. Trucks, however, pose unique challenges. “A truck driver has to be 100% engaged in the act of driving, scanning the horizon for that SUV that’s changing a tire on the shoulder or some idiot doing something dumb, and anything less isn’t something I want to deal with, ever,” said Scott Grenerth, regulatory affairs director for the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. The association represents the estimated 350,000 owner-operators nationwide. Grenerth, who as a trucker logged a million accident-free miles, said he welcomes any technology that enhances the safety and comfort of the trucking experience for drivers. But, he added, "I don't see computers being able to account for every situation a trucker might experience.” ATA spokesman McNally stressed that, depending on the type of cargo that’s being hauled, a driver might be required to constantly monitor his load’s safety. That would make going to sleep impossible. He also added that a regulatory framework that applies to all 50 states would be critical to making interstate self-driving trucking a reality. And then there’s the issue of jobs. “You talk about automated trucks and the topic of that being a job killer does come up with drivers,” McNally said. “We’d like to think you’ll always need a driver.” Otto’s Ron insisted that getting rid of truck drivers is not the company’s mission. “Remember, this technology works exit to exit, not really in a city, so you’ll need the driver,” he said. Nevertheless, Ron said Otto is unabashedly focusing on Level 4 autonomy because “handing control back to the driver at the last minute in case of an emergency will not work.” Automakers such as Ford have come to the same conclusion, pushing for full autonomy because there’s a danger in providing so much self-driving assistance that the driver is lulled into complacency and can’t retake control of the vehicle quickly. Federal officials are investigating a May crash in Florida that involved an Autopilot-equipped Tesla Model S, which slammed into the side of a truck that had cut in front of the electric sedan. In the coming weeks, Otto’s half-dozen $140,000 Volvo VNL 780 cabs, which are capable of pulling 53-foot trailers, will fan out across a few states for open-road testing. Hours will be logged to dial in the various fender, wheel and roof-mounted gear. The advantages of working on trucks include the fact that there’s more room to store the various computer componentry. Conversely, the extreme bumpiness of a truck’s ride means that those systems need to be better isolated from road harshness than their automotive counterparts. During USA Today’s short test drive, a couple of advantages over self-driving cars immediately surfaced. For one, a self-driving car’s tendency to drive like an elderly grandparent is annoying on city streets, but the same behavior in a truck on a highway doesn't give motorists fits. While Martin’s rig stayed in its lane at a steady 55 mph, most cars simply chose to pass us. And second, given that self-driving trucks may often find themselves virtually alone on an open highway, a system that serves as a super-sophisticated cruise control could take away some of the monotony of the driving chore. But ultimately it's difficult to make mental the leap from driver-monitored to driver-napping trucking. Simply put, the issue of a tractor cab (weighing around 15,000 to 20,000 pounds) and its trailer (from 30,000 to 60,000) barreling down the road at 70 mph with a computer at the helm is likely to worry truckers and regular drivers alike for some time. “I realize we are setting the bar high,” Ron said with a smile. “Once the technology is safer than driving a truck is on average, we will deploy. We understand it’s also about educating people and creating a dialog about what we’re doing. Initially it might be baby steps, but eventually, we think we’ll get there.” By Marco della Cava USA Today   Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

The interactive VR photography app is called Cardboard Camera and in addition to capturing 360-degree images, it also lets you share VR photos online and enjoy them in virtual reality with Google’s Cardboard and similar accessories along with VR photos taken by other people. “VR photos let you experience scenery and sound in every direction and in 3D, making near things look near, and far things look far,” says Google. “From vacation travels to family get-togethers, capture the moment with Cardboard Camera and relive it in VR.” To take a VR photo, hold the device in portrait orientation, tap the record button and turn around slowly as though you’re taking a panorama in the stock Camera app. After the image has been captured, tap the share icon and the app will generate a link that can be emailed, messaged, or posted in apps and on the web. You can even select multiple photos to create a virtual photo album. The app originally debuted on Android, with more than five million VR moments having been captured with Cardboard Camera on Android. With today’s release, iOS users can now capture VR photos and “relive those moments as if they were there,” too. More information is available at the Google VR website.

AI might be able to make Siri's voice sound a little more human (Photo: Getty)  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Google's DeepMind have revealed a new speech synthesis generator that will be used to help computer voices, like Siri and Cortana, sound more human. Named WaveNet, the model works with raw audio waveforms to make our robotic assistants sound, err, less robotic . WaveNet doesn't control what the computer is saying, instead it uses AI to make it sound more like a person, adding breathing noises, emotion and different emphasis into senteneces. Generating speech with computers is called text-to-speech (TTS) and up until now has worked by piecing together short pre-recorded syllables and sound fragments to form words. "Siri", voice-activated assistant technology, on an Apple iPhone As the words are taken from a database of speech fragments, it's very difficult to modify the voice, so adding things like intonation and emphasis is almost impossible. This is why robotic voices often sound monotonous and decidedly different from humans. WaveNet however overcomes this problem, by using its neural network models to build an audio signal from the ground up, one sample at a time. In 2014 Google bought DeepMind for £242m (Photo: Rex) During training the DeepMind team gave WaveNet real waveforms recorded from human speakers to learn from. Using a type of AI called a neural network, the program then learns from these, much in the same way a human brain does. The result was that the WaveNet learned the characteristics of different voices, could make non-speech sounds, such as breathing and mouth movements, and say the same thing in different voices. Despite the exciting advancement, the system still requires a huge amount of processing power, which means it will be a while before the technology appears in the likes of Siri. DeepMind's AlphaGo AI system that beat the world’s top ranked human player in the strategy game Go this year Google's machine learning unit DeepMind is based in the UK and have previously made headlines when their computer beat the Go World champion earlier this year. Using deep neural networks to create 16kHz audio seems to be just the tip of the iceberg as to what to machine learning can be applied to.

Two critical Android vulnerabilities were recently disclosed and patched on Nexus devices via an over-the-air security update. The first, discovered by Google Project Zero researcher Mark Brand, allows an attacker to remotely execute malware or escalate local privileges on exposed phones. Despite its "straightforward" nature, the bug is "extremely serious" and can be spread in a variety of ways, Brand wrote in a blog post. "It's interesting that it's been undiscovered for so long," he said. Brand's exploit works only on an undisclosed subset of Nexus handsets, and could not "be used in real-world attacks without substantial modification and even further research," Google told Ars Technica. Still, Brand suggested it is present in a number of recent releases. "The provided exploit performs this on several recent Android versions for the Nexus 5x, and is both reliable and fast in my testing," he said. According to September's Android security bulletin, Google has not yet received any reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly reported issues. Still, the company encourages all customers to update their devices when they can. //Related Articles Google Pays Out $550,000 to Android Bug Hunters The same update patches a second vulnerability similar to Stagefright. As reported by Ars, the bug is exploited by hiding malicious code in embedded JPEG image data, then sending the picture via Gmail or Google Talk. The unsuspecting target doesn't need to click on or open any links to become compromised. These vulnerabilities were made public around the same time that security firm Checkpoint disclosed two sets of malware planted in Google Play apps. Unveiled in late August, DressCode was allegedly used to spoof ad clicks and generate revenue for the attacker, but can also be applied to breach private internal networks. CallJam, meanwhile, was concealed inside the game Gems Chest for Clash Royale, and includes a premium dialer to generate fraudulent phone calls—but only after receiving permission from the device owner. Google did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. Back to top Previous : Zero-Day Hunters Offer $500K For iOS Bugs Can You Hack Nexus 6P, 5X?

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Mobile World FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Google Pixel XL to Carry a Price Tag of $649 in the US GO The smartphone could be announced on October 4 Sep 12, 2016 16:54 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google and HTC are working together on two upcoming smartphones which, until recently, were known as the Nexus Sailfish and Marlin. However, it seems that Google will ditch the Nexus branding and go with Pixel and Pixel XL instead. And now the price of one of the smartphones has leaked. David Ruddock from AndroidPolice has revealed that the price of the upcoming Pixel XL will reach $649 in the US, but that remains to be seen. David’s previous leaks have been quite accurate, but the price of a device is difficult to predict, since it could change at any moment before the release. He also mentions that he’s uncertain if the price is for the 32GB or 128GB version of the device, implying that we won’t be seeing a 64GB variant of the Pixel XL. Late last month, the price of the two upcoming Google devices leaked, suggesting that Pixel, known as Nexus Sailfish back then, would be sold for $449, while Pixel XL would carry a price tag of $599 for the variant with 32GB of internal storage. Just recently, David Ruddock revealed that the two smartphones would come with Snapdragon 821 SoC, being the first two devices in the US to incorporate the latest processor model from Qualcomm. If so, the price hike from $599 to $649 for the Pixel XL would be justified. Pixel XL might carry the same price as last year’s Nexus 6P Last year’s Nexus 6P was launched in the US with a price tag of $649 for the version with 128GB of internal storage, which could suggest that the rumored price tag for the Pixel XL could actually be for the variant with larger internal storage capacity. Pixel XL is rumored to boast a 5.5-inch display with 1440 x 2560 pixel resolution and 4GB of RAM, as well as a 12MP rear camera and an 8MP camera in the front. The smartphone is said to run Android 7.1 Nougat, the latest version which might also come with the Nexus Launcher and Google Assistant. Google will also offer Project Fi financing for the purchase of this smartphone. This one is more hearsay: price point being thrown around for Pixel XL is $649. Not clear if that's 32GB or 128GB. — David Ruddock (@RDR0b11) September 11, 2016 #Google#HTC#Pixel#Pixel XL#Android 7.1 Nougat subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Pixel XL Leaks in New Clear Case Renders Google Pixel (Nexus Sailfish) Leaks in 360-Degree Video and Press Renders Google's Two Upcoming Phones Will Arrive on October 4 as Pixel and Pixel XL Android 7.1 Nougat to Bring Nexus Launcher and Google Assistant Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

It wants you to take 3D 360-degree virtual reality photos and it has now released an app that lets you do just that. The Cardboard Camera app has been released today by Google and it’s available now for both iOS and Android users. Like the Google Cardboard VR viewer, the app works with the phone you already have, so no new hardware is required to use this app. Google’s Cardboard Camera app enables users to take virtual reality photos that are three-dimensional panoramas. It captures striking detail so things that are near in real life look near in the photo and things that are far, look far. Simply look around to explore the image in all directions and even hear the sound recorded when you were taking the photo to relive that moment exactly how it happened. Capturing a VR photo using this app is easy, just hold your phone vertically, tap record, and then turn around as though you are capturing a panorama. VR photos captured with this app can easily be shared with friends and family, the app itself will generate a link which can be emailed, texted, or posted in online apps. Viewers will need to have a Cardboard VR to get the intended immersive experience from these photos. The Google Cardboard Camera app is available as a free download for iOS and Android.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Tue, Sep 13, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Alphabet plans diabetes co-venture Bloomberg Google parent Alphabet Inc and French drugmaker Sanofi plan to invest about US$500 million in a joint venture to tackle diabetes amid forecasts for the number of people with the disease to surge. Sanofi is betting the partnership with Alphabet’s Verily Life Sciences LLC will spur advancements in the way diabetes is monitored and treated and help it navigate an increasingly competitive market. The venture, Onduo, plans to combine devices, software and medicine, according to a statement yesterday from Sanofi and Verily, previously known as Google Life Sciences. “The beauty of the joint venture in a way is that we don’t rely on the typical 10-year development cycle of a pharmaceutical asset,” Stefan Oelrich, senior vice president and head of the global diabetes franchise at Sanofi, said in an interview. “We start to innovate today.” Sanofi expects increased competition in the diabetes market to remain as cheaper copies of biotech drugs known as biosimilars are rolled out. It plans to distinguish itself from rivals with programs like the Verily venture, unveiled last year, Oelrich said. Sanofi is investing US$248 million in cash and Verily is committing an “equivalent” amount, he said. “With more market entrants and as the space gets more crowded, it will be more difficult to maintain your stance from a contracting and commercial standpoint,” Oelrich said. “There’s increased competition on price. I think it’s here to stay.” The drugmaker has been reshaping its diabetes portfolio after cutting its three-year sales forecast for the business last year because of a slump in demand for its best-selling medicine, Lantus. Sanofi is relying on new treatments including its Toujeo insulin to help make up for the Lantus revenue shortfall. The company plans to step up efforts to convince purchasers that its drugs are better than rivals’ treatments, Oelrich said. Lantus last month was replaced on CVS Health Corp’s 2017 list of covered drugs by Eli Lilly & Co’s Basaglar, a cheaper version of the insulin that is scheduled to be sold in the US starting in December. Given Sanofi’s reliance on Lantus, it will be hard for the company to escape near-term pressure as such biosimilars are introduced, according to a Sept. 7 report from Berenberg Bank analysts in London. Sanofi is carrying out “the biggest real-world evidence” program ever for Toujeo to highlight to payers the differences between the treatments, Oelrich said. “It’s our job to make sure that we have a convincing value story behind that because not all these products are the same,” he said. The results of the program, which involve more than 4,500 patients in the US and Europe through three studies, will assess the efficacy of the once-a-day insulin, with results expected next year. The Sanofi and Verily venture will focus on developing ways to improve medication management and habits for patients and will be led by Joshua Riff as chief executive officer. The company will take advantage of Verily’s experience in miniaturized electronics, analytics and consumer software, according to the statement. This story has been viewed 1436 times.

Google has been working on their own way for users to read articles or topics at a later time, and has introduced the feature within the Chrome Beta and Chrome Dev applications. Whenever Google wants to test out a new feature, these two applications are where the initial testing begins, and the same rings true this time around. In order to access the new Read It Later feature, you’ll need to tap the three-dot overflow menu and select “Read it later in Chrome” if you’re using Chrome Dev. If you’re using the Chrome Beta application, everything functions the same, but the prompt reads “Keep tab in Chrome”. Image courtesy of Android Police There is a bit of hitch, however, if you want to use this feature within the Chrome Beta application as you’ll need to enable it. Here are the steps you need to take: Navigate to chrome://flags Scroll to “Enable read it later in app menu.” Toggle the drop down menu and select “Enable” Once selected the app will restart, and you should be able to see the option to save webpages directly from within the Chrome application. Luckily, the Chrome Dev version already sees this new feature enabled, so there’s no extra tinkering that needs to be done. I’m super excited for this functionality to be built-into Chrome, as I’ve never been a huge fan of saving to another application. As long as everything goes according to play, we can hope to see this new feature rolled out to the stable version of Chrome sometime in October. The update is available today, so you can head over to the Play Store and download either the Chrome Dev or Chrome Beta application. Keep in mind, not all of the features that are included in these applications are ready for prime-time, so you may experience some crashing or other issues while using the app. Download on Google Play: Chrome Dev Download on Google Play: Chrome Beta [Android Police] local_offer    Google   Google Chrome   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (3) stars Further Reading OnePlus 3T charging proves solid Allo gets themes, emoji suggestions, and more Google and Facebook are challenging bogus websites Google WiFi preorders launch Free Daydream Views now available stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

The APK can be found here.   Google’s upcoming Pixel phones are expected to come with a new-look launcher, too, and today some alleged screenshots of that launcher have leaked. The images come to us from @LlabTooFeR, a well-known HTC leaker. These screenshots look similar to the ones that surfaced back in early August, showing a new “G” tab for launching Google search and a calendar widget that shows the date and day of the week. At the bottom of the display is the new dock, which swaps out the app drawer icon found on Google’s current launch for an arrow that sits above the dock. Tapping the arrow or swiping up on the dock will bring up the new app drawer. Also of note is that when your home screen is turned sideways, the dock arrow moves over to the lower left corner of the display. As with most leaks, this Pixel Launcher isn’t official until Google says it is, so it’s possible that we could see some differences between the launcher shown in today’s leak and the one that arrives with Google’s new Pixel phones. This Pixel Launcher looks like a nice update to Google’s existing launcher, though. The “G” tab lets you see more of your wallpaper, and the refreshed dock that’s swapped out its app drawer icon for an arrow gives you an extra spot in your dock for quick access to another of your favorite apps. Google is expected to officially take the wraps off of its new Pixel phones (and presumably this Pixel Launcher) on Oct. 4.

The Galaxy Note 7 and iPhone 7 are already official, with the former dealing with a massive recall and the latter nearing its in-store launch. But Google’s 2016 Nexus devices that will not have Nexus branding are still in the works and should launch next month. New reports indicate the Pixel and Pixel XL may be the fastest Android phones in town, but there's also some bad news in store. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 preorders: We have entered a parallel universe The Pixel (Sailfish) and Pixel XL (Marlin) might be the only Android handsets to ship with the updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor on board in the US. The news comes from Android Police’s David Ruddock, who took to Twitter to explain Google’s thinking behind the Pixel line. https://twitter.com/RDR0b11/status/775004127717765121 “By the way, as far as I can tell, the Pixels will by the first US devices with Snapdragon 821 by a long shot. No one else is using it,” he said. "Pixel phones will have exclusive Google support, exclusive software features, and exclusive financing options," he also noted. "Google is going for it." "So, if you're the person who wanted Google to 'really get out there and market their phones,' you may finally see your wish granted," Ruddock added. As for prices, Google “is getting out of the ‘cheap phone’ business at this point,” he said. “This one is more hearsay: price point being thrown around for Pixel XL is $649. Not clear if that's 32GB or 128GB.” https://twitter.com/RDR0b11/status/774999884915060737 But these aren’t the only Pixel leaks we have for you today. AndroidPure has a Google Pixel XL leak as well. The phone, complete with its ugly rear design, was shown in what appears to be a case leak. The images were posted on Weibo initially, showing a phone that’s similar to what we’ve seen in other leaks. And yes, there’s Google branding on the back, rather than Nexus. google-pixel-nexus-2016-case-leak-1More Finally, Android Authority has a video that supposedly shows the HTC-made Google Pixel in a 360-degree video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIQZ1K0G8uM Trending right now: Tim Cook hints the MacBook Pro update we want is on the way Galaxy Note 7 explodes in the hands of a 6-year-old Apple gave an iPhone 7 Plus to an NFL photographer and the results are stunning See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Tech CEO who vowed to murder Donald Trump with a sniper rifle forced to resign BGR News WhatsApp video calling is finally here Yahoo Tech Forget Black Friday, Sam’s Club has a serious one-day sales event this Saturday BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Best Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed BGR News New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time BGR News This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Google use to show the address of the local listing in the snippets on the left hand side but now, it seems Google has removed the full addresses from the Google Maps listing snippets completely. They still do show in the local pack in the web results but they do not show in the Google Maps listings view. Here are before and after screen shots from the Local Search Forums: Before (showing addresses): After (addresses removed): Forum discussion at Local Search Forums. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Google AdWords Keyword Planner Modifying Your Keywords   Comments: O Rly 09/12/2016 12:43 pm Addresses still show on purple labeled ads. It seems like if there is a paid listing for a business, their organic result is un-naturally low in the listings? Michael 09/12/2016 01:33 pm Surely a bad thing for most companies. But there are some who don't want their address to be publicly viewable, so this may make them sign up for a listing now. This is people who work from home like psychotherapists. Michael Martinez 09/12/2016 02:12 pm When you click on the map icons the left panel populates with information about the businesses. On mobile this becomes an information overlay. Mambo Man 09/12/2016 03:01 pm Horrible USER EXPERIENCE w/ this format. The local/maps listings format has always been run by Clowns! Alex - New Frontiers Marketing 09/12/2016 07:51 pm I'm not a fan of this change myself. Not yet anyway - perhaps the positive effects will become clearer in time. vipinnayar 09/13/2016 12:08 am This update is for any new Google's paid update Bhuvan Sagar Basireddy 09/13/2016 05:41 am May be Google is updating local map results. BMCInternetMarketing 09/13/2016 06:15 am Well it started a while ago with not showing the city in the address. Not seeing these changes in The Netherlands, Germany, Candada.... Amit 09/13/2016 08:17 am Why google hide the addresses..? Bob L 09/13/2016 12:27 pm Can not stand when the information needed (often timely) is obfuscated to generate more ad clicks. jeffhopp 09/13/2016 04:55 pm Service area businesses have been able to choose to have their address not displayed for quite a while. Brandon Prettyman 09/13/2016 08:39 pm Google still displays the full street address in Maps if you click the 'More places' from the local 3-pack. Otherwise, the exact address is hidden if you search directly from Maps. Rohit Sharma 09/14/2016 09:56 am Yes Google still displays the full street address in Maps if you search more places from the local 3-pack. but if Google has removed the full addresses from the Google Maps listing snippets completely then it will effect in business leads.

This is part of Google's AMP series this week. But in that blog post, Google also said that AMP pages will give you "expanded exposure" in the mobile search results. Here is the quote: Later this year, all types of sites that create AMP pages will have expanded exposure across the entire Google Mobile Search results page, like e-commerce, entertainment, travel, recipe sites and many more. Google specifically linked the expanded exposure phrase to the August 2nd announcement. Of course, some SEOs are pulling that line out as a bit unusual. "Later this year, all types of sites that create AMP pages will have expanded exposure in the Google Mobile SERPs" https://t.co/6141GWabkq— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) September 12, 2016 It is not typical and Google is being careful how they say it but at the same time, it seems Google is using those words to really encourage webmasters to go forward with making AMP pages. Google isn't specifically promising better rankings, just "expanded exposure" which would come through the carousels. But for that you need the structured markup on top of the AMP.

So if you enter in [search engine optimization] Google will show you at the top the phrase [seo] instead. I received a bunch of notifications about this over the weekend. Here is one on Twitter from Jack Stonehouse who wrote "odd happenings with the keyword planner, seems to be showing the most searched for variant." He shared this screen shot: RankRanger posted a deep dive on this today going through this change. They said "Google's keyword research tool is now altering search queries, presenting results that don't exactly match the initial phrase. As a result, Keyword Planner is at times showing results that not only don't match the query exactly, but seriously deviate from the possible intent behind it." I recommend you check out their blog post to understand how serious this can be for some keywords. I do not see any feedback from Google on this yet but we are on the case. This has come after Google restricted access to the keyword planner tool to many and truth is, they expanded that restricted access over the past week or so. Update: This supposedly started back in July but now they are being more "transparent" about it. Forum discussion at Twitter. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Google Tests "Helpful" Button In Google Reviews   Comments: O Rly 09/12/2016 12:47 pm Google has hit a plateau. Their search volume has leveled off, so now they need to obscure any sources that outsiders may use to see how MSVs are doing. The past 2-3 years mobile's growth hid the fact that desktop growth was flat or actually declining, but once mobile (and its cheaper CPCs, although offset by higher CTRs) hits that same wall, they're going to start being a whole lot more evil than they already have been. The end goal is no exact match, no phrase match. Just give Google a budget and let them spend as they see fit. Michael 09/12/2016 01:29 pm I have been in touch with the Adwords team on Facebook today. They replied with a link explaining that lower spend campaigns will get less information compared to high spenders. Then I asked about this specific question and they aren't replying to this one. Are people with sizeable spending campaigns still getting alternative words? Guy W Lecky-Thompson 09/12/2016 03:15 pm There's also an issue around what constitutes a 'high spender'. For example, if you operate in a niche that has lower ad CTR's, then your burn rate is going to be lower than someone who operates in a high-volume, high-CTR niche, where the advert CPC the same as someone else's entire monthly AdWord spend. I'm sure that the Googlers are on the case, and have worked out a fair way to establish who to penalize/reward, but still I worry what advice to be giving out at this point: choose a high-value AdWord to up your campaign spend, mixed in with the lower-order ones, or trust that AdWords staff have it under control? Any thoughts form those more experienced and better-informed than I? LJ 09/12/2016 04:07 pm I would advise to not resort to paying throught the nose for a worthless keyword JUST for the purpose to get full access to the Keyword Planner... Travis Causey 09/12/2016 06:36 pm I'm seeing different results on different accounts but don't really trust any of it yet. My larger account have spend close to $10,000/month and showing minimal results. You can quickly figure out search volume by seeing what keywords run up clicks. Guest 09/12/2016 06:45 pm if customer is paying then he do not need fake traffic. in present, Google advertisement lost its faith because of these fake traffic. if Google is not responsible for it ? then Google should take action against it because adwords is a investment in which businessmen want to get some return but when Adwords do not convert then it is the failure of faith upon Google Adwords. May be, in present Google is earning good amount and do not want to take a look upon these but this ignorance will make big loss to Google in future. Alex - New Frontiers Marketing 09/12/2016 08:04 pm Wow, what is going on at Google HQ right now? I would be seriously worried by these changes if I was an Adwords customer. I think this all signals the importance of mastering several different traffic sources; that way, if one changes in a way that goes against your needs, then you've still got others you can use. Bhuvan Sagar Basireddy 09/13/2016 05:42 am I think Old Google keyword research tool was more than new one. Josoft Technologies Pvt Ltd 09/13/2016 06:13 am Helpful information and thanks Barry for sharing this with us, yes I think it's going to be more difficult for webmaster and AdWords managers. Kano 09/13/2016 07:09 am To gain more revenue to Google company :) Shaun Friedlander 09/13/2016 08:40 am Can you share the link he sent you? essmeier 09/13/2016 10:05 pm Google: Don't be evil. Rohit Sharma 09/14/2016 10:24 am I do not see any feedback from Google on this yet but we are on the case. as well as if you there will be any changes then it will effect the search quarry and navigation. Simon 09/21/2016 09:59 am Really bad news for SEO folks. I don't run AdWords campaigns but do of course need keyword data for SEO purposes. Luckily I found a great cheap Keyword Research tool.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Biotech Firm With Great Potential Biotech Firm With Great Potential Posted on September 12, 2016 by ACR Communication, LLC in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer LAS VEGAS, NV / ACCESSWIRE / September 12, 2016 / Early last month GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) announced a major new joint venture with Verily — once Google Life Sciences — with the hope of creating the first generation of bioelectronic medicines for chronic diseases. The company committed to investing $715 million over the next 7 years into a Joint Venture with Verily focused on building devices targeting arthritis, diabetes and asthma. Verily, a part of Alphabet ($GOOG), emerged from its secretive Google X division and has recently become its own unit focused on big data and devices, such as a “smart” contact lens and surgical robots. This venture will be called Galvani Bioelectronics (named after the Italian 18th century pioneer in the field of bioelectricity Luigi Aloisio Galvani), will be 55% owned by GSK and 45% by Verily. The main goal of this venture will be to produce an implantable bioelectronic device. Bioelectronic medicine essentially works like this: many of the processes of the human body are controlled by electrical signals firing between the nervous system and the body’s organs, which may become distorted in many chronic diseases. Bioelectronic medicine’s vision is to employ the latest advances in biology and technology to interpret this electrical conversation and to correct the irregular patterns found in disease states, using miniaturized devices attached to individual nerves. If successful, this approach offers the potential for a new therapeutic modality alongside traditional medicines and vaccines. If you’re looking to invest in bioelectronic medicine, however, this joint venture may not be the best route as a company already has a product targeting inflammation like this joint venture seeks to achieve and it’s also NON INVASIVE! That company is Endonovo Therapeutics, Inc. (ENDV). ENDV is developing bioelectronic medicines targeting unmet needs in inflammatory conditions in vital organs. One of Endonovo’s lead programs is its Immunotronics platform, a non-invasive, non-implantable device for treating and/or preventing vital organ failure, which can result from an out of control inflammatory response to injury and infection. The initial focus of the company is to use the Immunotronics platform to treat acute and chronic inflammatory conditions of the liver, such as liver injury and possibly Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). Here are a few highlights we believe make ENDV a better option in bioelectronics than GSK: Endonovo Immunotronics and Cytotronics platforms are built upon technology discovered at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ENDV’s technology has been shown to be a potent non-invasive anti-inflammatory device in a pharmaceutical “gold standard” model of acute inflammation. Non-invasive technology targets cells and organs directly rather than relying on vagus nerve stimulation used by implantable devices. Possible Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) pathway for treating acute liver failure is a potential gateway indication for Endonovo’s platform. There is also the possibility that this new GSK joint venture may find that ENDV‘s product is better than what they come up with, and actually decide to acquire the company which could be a major boon for ENDV investors. This week is a great time to consider taking a long look at ENDV. Here’s a few other biotechs in the news: Geron Corporation (GERN) company has made a really nice uptick over the course of the last week. Keep an eye on this one for another possible breakout! Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. (ESPR) this stock is down considerably from just a few months back, put this one on your watchlist for a possible swing trade. Galena Biopharma, Inc. (GALE) had a number of Reuters analysts recently comment on the stock. Currently the company has earned ‘Buy’ from 1 equity analyst. 0 analysts hold a ‘Sell’ rating for the stock. 2 analysts have suggested the company is a ‘Hold’. ‘Underperform’ verdict was shared by 0 analyst and ‘Outperform’ recommendation was issued by 1 analyst. The company has an Average Rating of 2.25 based on analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters. Immunomedics, Inc. (IMMU) announced that the Company will present at three upcoming investor conferences: Credit Suisse 2016 Antibody Day at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at Credit Suisse’s campus in New York City; 2016 Wells Fargo Healthcare Conference at 3:30 pm Eastern Time on Thursday, September 8, 2016 at the Westin Waterfront in Boston, MA; and Rodman &amp; Renshaw 18th Annual Global Investment Conference at 4:15 pm on Tuesday, September 13, 2016 at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel in New York City.

You can look around to explore the image in all directions, and even hear sound recorded while you took the photo to hear the moment exactly as it happened. To capture a VR photo, hold your phone vertically, tap record, then turn around as though you’re taking a panorama. New for the app for both iOS and Android today is the ability to share VR photo albums with friends. A new sharing option will allow you to select multiple photos and generate a sharing link that you can send via email, message, or elsewhere. Google shared an example of a sharing link here. Google already had a separate Google Cardboard app for iPhone, which assists users in setting up Google Cardboard VR viewers made for iPhone and includes a few VR experiences built-in. The new Google Cardboard Camera app for iOS is available on the App Store now.

Follow along here. JEAN MARIE RIVER, NWT—If you want to know what our continent’s Arctic coast looks like, Google Street View isn’t much help. Take Canada’s Northwest Territories. You can vicariously poke around the funky capital, Yellowknife. You can click through the two main bush-breaching highways, see the igloo church in Inuvik, and find where the camera car got lost and turned around at a hunting shack. There’s even a photo of stray dogs near the overgrown gas-stop of Enterprise, fitting but random. Zoom out on the map a bit, though, and you’ll find that those photographed areas constitute nothing more than two small papercuts on a whale-sized chunk of land. Most of Google’s map coverage of the Northwest Territories is a low-def green blur. In Google’s defense, there aren’t many streets, not as most Americans or southerly Canadians would recognize them anyway. And it is a really big place, about the size of California and Texas and Montana combined. Google’s inability to acquire and catalog the data of this portion of the Earth feeds what we southerners think we know about the Arctic: it’s big and it’s empty. But that second part isn’t entirely true. Moose aren’t the only residents up there, and climate change—warming the Arctic twice as fast as the rest of the planet—impacts more than polar bears and walruses. Indigenous communities, the traditional homes of the Dene and Gwitch’in and Inuit First Nations peoples, dot the rivers and lakes, outposts of an old civilization in a vast land. Which is one reason I canoed the entire Mackenzie River this past summer, 1,125 miles from Great Slave Lake, travelling northwest to the Arctic Ocean. Ironically, I went into the wilderness to talk to people. At the port of Hay River I loaded my canoe with peanut butter and oatmeal and video equipment, and over the next 40 days, through thunderstorms, whitecaps, blazing heat, and yes, even snow at the end, I paddled and camped, stopping at villages and fishing camps along the way. Ironically, I went into the wilderness to talk to people. I went to listen to the local people, to hear the concerns most important to them. I ended up learning about disrupted hunting patterns and disappearing caribou, fibre-optic lines and road construction, oil drilling and pipelines, and in-ground cold storage shelters that no longer stay cold, among other things. Because this was no see-the-glaciers-before-they’re-gone kind of trip. It’s already too late for that: the river water is warmer, the ice retreats faster, the forest fires spread further, the permafrost dwindles. Only by getting out on the land do you learn about the unexpected, hard-to-predict, second order effects of climate change. For example, warmer winters mean big, fat bears. “They don’t sleep as long,” said Peanuts Heron, a Chipewyan member of the Dene nation. “They wake up fat, instead of skinny. We can’t trust them anymore. You can’t trust a fat black bear when he hasn’t slept.” Lately, that short winter has been followed by hotter summers. For thousands of years, the Dene people have traveled via the Mackenzie River—known to them as the Deh Cho, the “Big River”—to Great Slave Lake and nearby tributaries to fish. But John, an elder in the Slavey band of the Dene nation, told me that traditional pattern has been disrupted as well. “Fishing isn’t like it used to be,” he said. “It’s too warm. The fish are slow. And too many otters. You put out a net, they take the fish before you get there.” Mackenzie River watershed. Image: Shannon1/Wikimedia Commons I met John in the little hamlet of Jean Marie River, only three days into my trip down the Mackenzie. By happenstance, I stopped in town just as the 24th Annual Dehcho First Nations Assembly was underway. Jean Marie River barely qualifies as a settlement by southern standards: seventy-odd residents, no stores of any kind, a cluster of log homes and pre-fab trailers, and a volunteer fire station. The band office has solar panels, but a diesel power plant drones away near the gravel airstrip; mail is delivered on Thursdays. John was in town for the assembly, passing the heat of the day in the shade thrown by the ceremonial hall. The circular meeting space had plenty of traditional elements—fire at the center, fresh cut willow branches blocking the sun—but the tone was official and high tech, interpreters in sound-proof boxes translating English to Slavey and back in real time. The theme of the conference was nominally “Adapting and Thriving with Climate Change in Denendeh,” referencing the lands of the Dene people in the upper Mackenzie River valley. Appropriate to the subject matter, it was wickedly hot, even for June. John was sitting in a small group of elders who preferred the breeze outside. The ceremonial house at Jean Marie River.

To say that he was skeptical of the assembly is an understatement. “This is just like the Indian Brotherhood days, back in the 60s and 70s. Remember that?” Allan said, elbowing John. “They start with the lawyers, and that confuses everyone and gets them off track, and then they talk about treaty claims and not climate change.” Beneath the Deh Cho—up and down the river valley, through the delta, and into the adjacent Beaufort Sea—lies the planet’s third largest proven energy reserve. (At 167 billion barrels of proven oil, Canada is behind only Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, which have 298 and 260 billion barrels, respectively.) Which is why any discussion of climate change in this region always seems to begin with a discussion of land rights. The federal government, territorial government, First Nations, and commercial interests all have conflicting historical claims. Who may develop the land? Should communities do their part to fight climate change, or focus instead on adaptation, as the premier of the Northwest Territories recently said? What land should be set aside, what should be exploited, and how much? One “interim” land use plan is already a decade old. The author, paddling. Cinemagraph by Zoe Miller Tacked
